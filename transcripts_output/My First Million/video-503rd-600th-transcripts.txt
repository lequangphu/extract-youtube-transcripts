I just got a text message that says let's get some estrogen in this [ __ ] that's right we have a guest host today Sam is out he had a baby congratulations to him but we have Cody Sanchez here to take his place and Cody text me because she says I got a bunch of ideas for dudes who don't understand the women's market and uh they're not playing these games there's less competition but these are Big opportunities so she said she's got four ideas that are blind spots for men but that the women will understand so for the four female listeners out there this is your day today is your day the moment you've been waiting for it only took us 500 episodes to make an episode that is Catered around ideas for the the market for women I can barely even say it I don't even understand I'm excited to see what she says the second thing that I'm going to do is Cody is always on social media talking about buying laundromats and I'm going to ask her I'm G to ask her Cody do you really buy [ __ ] laundromats and do these make money and why are you buying these things so that's what's coming in the second half of the episode and at the end I'm going to ask her about her content game because she's built up a following got millions of followers now she said she does 100 million impressions a month across all her channels and this is all kind of in three years so she's built an amazing social brand but with that comes a bunch of haters and people saying that she's just like a a business Guru or a grifter so I'm going to ask her straight up I'm going to say hey what's the deal Cody are you a grifter and what's your response to that address the haters and we're going to ask her to address the haters so that's what's in this episode hope you enjoy this episode with our guest host Cody [Music] Sanchez [Music] okay um what's up we got Cody Sanchez in the house guest host congrats to Sam he had his baby he's out on um on Daddy leave Patty leave whatever whatever people call it nowadays he is um going skin to skin he's swaddling he is diaper changing I'm sure he's doing all those things haven't actually asked him because got to give the man some space but um I decided while Sam's out I want to have guest hosts so not just a guest but a guest host and what I mean by that is here's the criteria somebody who I already know and like so a friend uh friend of the house number two is they got to know the vibe so they listen to MFM they know that what this podcast is all about is talking about ideas opportunities or interesting businesses that not everybody knows about so they got to come prepared with that and uh it's like so you're taking the role of Sam Cody how does that feel are you are you ready to be Sam do I have to drink Co water if I also co-host Z you know Sam really really well you hung out with him in person so I feel like you got his uh you know his Vibe yeah totally yeah uh no Sam's a dear friend and so is Sarah and I think they're G to make hell of parents so I'm stoked but yes those are big huge giant shoes and he's a giant man to Phil so I'll try to do the best I can and um for people who don't know give us like the 30 seconds you know who are you uh so that so that people understand who you know who they're messing with yeah uh well I run something called contran thinking which is probably hope people know about me on the internet that's a newsletter actually like slightly inspired by Sam and our other friends at morning Brew um it's got a couple hundred thousand subscribers now hoping to get to the million by the end of the year and that Media Company overall gets about 100 million views a month like 5 million subscribers which is kind of cool and I talk on the internet about boring businesses and stuff that I've invested in for a long time so for forever I'm like old for the internet but for forever I was in Investment Banking in private equity and buying small businesses like private Equity people do and then just holding them and I guess like the real way to say it would be a family office uh and then that became bigger so we turned it into a holding company and now we buy what I call small boring businesses and then talk to other people about how to do the same so you sent me this notion do that can only be described as prolific epic it's got like 30 genuinely interesting uh ideas opportunities in this we're not going to get through all of them but I bucketed some of them into uh category one so opportunity one you called let's get some estrogen in this [ __ ] go ahead I'll take the floor I feel like because I am a legitimate fan of the Pod uh I know I know my fellow uh pod listeners and the idea was that for everybody on Twitter Brewing who typically listens to this podcast maybe there's this like segment of the market with a little bit more estrogen than you guys have uh that we could steal our homework and there are all these businesses that like I would love to see more of and so since people in the pot actually go out there and do things and build these businesses we'll give you some ideas I don't know where you want to start but I basically was joking with your your producer and I was like is this legitimate or is Cody crazy and she was like she said explicitly I feel like you saw into my soul so it's safe to say women everywhere I think will like these ideas or you'll tell us if you hate it on the internet yeah I've known producer Ari for she's been with us for like two weeks now three weeks maybe and uh I've never seen her smiling this hard as she's so excited for this segment so I want to do the one that that stood out to me right away you you said the traditional wife movement oh yeah I think the best business ideas start with like a um a behavioral observation so just a behavioral phenomenon you notice people doing something or you notice the pendulum swinging where people used to feel one way or the popular sentiment is one thing but you notice people starting to gravitate towards the other end of that uh of that Spectrum that's usually where there's like a real real opportunity so what's what's an observation here that you have yeah so so if people don't know the Trad wife movement I find it fascinating and basically how I came across it as one does is I was on Instagram scrolling my life away and I saw this like beautiful woman flowy dress no shoes running through like what I could only describe as a field that was her house and um and overlaid on top of it she had like her little child in front of her and it was like girl boss question mark I want to be a hobbit mama and I was just like giggling kind of ridiculously at this and then I thought well I kind of I kind of feel that like I feel like we we know from Co everybody like wanted to go be a gentleman farmer right I think you guys talked about that but this is like the 2.0 version and so what happened from this one video I saw is that Instagram realized I watched it longer than I guess I do other things so I got served up all this stuff and boy before you [ __ ] know it uh Sean I buy some white pumpkins some flowers to press onto them and I'm [ __ ] gluing pansies on a pumpkin now you actually know me they're like I don't have hobbies like all I do is work we run a bunch of businesses I'm like not that fun and I'm I'm sitting in front of the TV gluing pumpkins and that's when I realized I think this is going to be huge so I looked up the Tik talk uh views for this search of tradwife 187 million which was wild and we could like play with a bunch of different ideas but then I was like maybe this is the counterculture movement to the call her daddy move which like used to be the top of the charts and looks like it's come down from top one or two podcast to top 20 to 30 on the charts and so the idea is how can we play to that market our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better so first of all do you feel threatened I feel like you're the girl boss like you you are in the the top ranking if somebody said oh name like five girl boss people I'd be like oh Sophia morosa and then I say you like I feel like that's kind of you uh in terms of your Public Image do you look at this like uh you know Kryptonite and in some way where you're like oh [ __ ] uh they're going the other way now what what's your reaction to this well like honestly that whole girl boss boss babe bab's bosses money like I want to die I want to die on the inside anytime I see any of those names and I remember once I got invited to a speech and they were like we need a female CEO uh to speak here and I was like I'm really unclear what my vagina has to do about this and the guy was like in like I can just feel him shriveling you know on his email like I was like I don't think it's relevant um so I'm kind of curious I'm hugely biased so who knows if I'm right but um I'm happily married I'm like a very big family gal like I I don't talk about sex on the internet like call her daddy I think you should do whatever you want just not my jam um so I'm kind of curious like we had these two worlds for so long right you were either single crazy fem you know don't need no man independent right or you were traditional stay atome you know protect the the familial unit and I just think both seem sort of ridiculous so can't we have people who like I don't know both people have some sorts of hobbies and work and that maybe just wishful thinking because the world's too polarize for that well I think to I totally agree with you and I think that obviously we in a way we simplify ourselves to make ourselves a great brand like the simpler the logo the simpler the slogan the simpler the the the the less threedimensional you are the easier it is as a brand initially and then of course you're like no no no but I'm I have all these layers you know I do have the soft side I do have this right like I do this every anybody who's built a brand on the internet does this you first simplify and then you try to add depth and so um the downside of the simp the upside of the simplify is you get a whole bunch of followers a bunch of people know you for boring businesses and kicking ass in the in the business world people know sweaty startup for the sweaty startup thing they don't want to hear his stock picks they don't want to hear his other stuff because it's not on brand for him and of course people do want to shift over time what I find interesting in this like this observation you have I actually think there's three so I think there's the caller daddy which I'll I'll put in there which is like the um sex positive sort of like uh girls can be players too um it's more of a relationship empowerment thing but not so much career then you have the career work empowerment which is like you know like you said what does my vagina have anything to do with this and then you have the sort of Traditional Values and of course people float between all three depending on the day the situation the phase of life that they're in ETC I've definitely noticed this movement coming because my wife is exactly like this she's like she's like yeah it's imp I can't say this like out in the world but I kind of like gender roles like I just want you to take out the trash and I'm down to do this stuff with the kids and then I just want you to always drive and like she's like why I don't want to fite all this and she's also like she's wor she worked really hard she had a better career than me uh when we met and stuff like that like she was totally good at that but she also was like yeah I really want to be a stay home wife like that's my next phase um you know I I want that I just want to do house stuff and like that's where her mindset was at at the time and so it is very in but but I noticed that she couldn't really come out and say that and anytime there's like a there's a belief or behavior that can't be said there's an opportunity this is what Trump capitalized on when he became president was there was a bunch of thoughts in people's heads that he was the only guy willing to say out loud um and and there's a whole bunch of examples of this in business where there are um like grinder is a good example of this there was a behavior that was happening that was not compatible with traditional dating and grinder came in and enabled that spoke to that and was able to do it even though it was somewhat taboo um and they're not always in these like uh sketchy areas another example of that would be uh Snapchat so when everything became public and permanent because so Facebook was the big social network and then Instagram was the big social network and it was like perfectly filtered photos publicly on display not even for your friends and family for all your followers and it goes on your feed and then you had Snapchat come out which was like make a silly face is going to disappear in 5 seconds and so it's like the bigger one thing gets the craving grows for the opposite for the other for the anti whatever the current thing is that's true well even I mean you can see it if you look at the Kardashians body types for instance like they were like you know they were they had a lot of butt they had a lot of up top they had a lot of curve going on there for a minute and that became the the norm right you saw like people getting fillers that were huge I mean huge uh industry cosmetology and and Men Spas experienced the biggest growth increase uh during any historical period in the US which is wild we looked at a vesting in a couple of them and I was like the margins these places make is incredible and then what do you see now the Kardashians if you're up up to the no now Sean the Kardashians now are like removing their Brazilian butt lifts they're taking out fillers there's like that one black China she like got rid of everything I guess she had a ton of stuff and so I think even the the really really big celebrities are starting to realize ooh like the trend is changing and so if you're you're as as as committed to the cause as those ladies are you change your whole body which is wild yeah that's one way to look at it for sure I remember the first time I heard B BL I thought somebody was talking about like a Basketball League like a Brazilian basketball league and I was like oh this is going to be a great conversation and then quickly I realized I was completely out of my death I had no idea what anyone was talking about but it's true right like the Jenner Kendall Jenner whatever like totally opposite body type as as Kim Kardashian right so it is a I guess like a sign of the times so what would you do off this so you notice the Trad wife movement you see the Tik Tok views going up you see people more interested in this lifestyle you start buying white pumpkins and hot gluing Live Laugh Love on them so what happens next what's the opportunity here okay well a couple of them that I thought were fascinating so one is I'm sure you don't spend your time in the weekend here but a bunch of chicks and people do in general it's called Hobby Lobby and basically it's you know crafting but if you think about what the store looks like it looks like kind of a gnarly CVS right fluorescent lights everything's a little dirty too much stuff crammed in there why does anybody need 472 tooth butt uh toothpaste skew like nobody knows and it's always packed which astounds me me um then I was like how big is this company and apparently they do7 billion a year in sale which is wild and then TJ Max HomeGoods and that whole entity is like 51 billion I don't know how big HomeGoods is as a portion of it but HomeGoods would be like Hobby Lobby but it's done for you so Hobby Lobby is like here's a bunch of here's a recipe we're going to give you the ingredients you put it together and then HomeGoods is like Cody doesn't have to paint the pumpkin it's already there she gets to buy it live laugh love included right um and what I thought was funny is I was chatting beforehand with Ari about this and I was like there's some crazy thing about women and candles is your wife like this Sean does she love a good candle crazy yeah go on I do not stand by that wife of Sean by the way she doesn't listen don't worry she never heard one episode um but women like we as a gross generality I'm sure a bunch of people are going to hate this on the internet afterwards but as a gross generality there's like something uh that we love about a discount on like a HomeGoods item like a nice little vase a candle drives men's crazy but I think that there's a play here for uh HomeGoods or Hobby Lobby 2.0 and all you would have to do is have any sort of retail experience walk in there go oh God there's nothing nice about this place except that it has what is required um and like church it up so that's one thing especially cuz because retail is so cheap right now like we own a commercial um strip mall and couldn't fill the [ __ ] thing I mean really having a hard time and so I like that play I like that too I have a friend that um owns almost a billion dollars of real estate outright so not a fund like they own it it's about 6040 Equity uh in debt and they um one of I was like and they do commercial retail and I remember sitting with them and I was like dude commercial like isn't that dead like what do you in my world it's like everything's going online and Retail brick and mortar like this is a graveyard you're leaning in you're you're doubling down why do you don't you need to get rid of this portfolio ASAP and he was like yes in general but there's a u he's like the segment I went into is like super resilient nobody can touch him he goes my number one tenant in all of my he basically goes to these like giant strip mall type places like or shopping centers that are empty can't can't fill a a lease and he goes to Hobby Lobby he says would you like to be here and Hobby Lobby's like yes we're expanding because I was like who's expanding right now he's like I'll tell you who's expanding Hobby Lobby HomeGoods and then he explained all these and he's like basically anything that's got um this kind of DIY craft thing he's like it's you can't touch it it's like there there's so much uh demand for it they just keep expanding he goes also the HomeGoods thing he's like there's um there's like a treasure hunt Dynamic to it which is exactly what you just said he goes women want to physically go to the store because it's a deal hunting experience that if you can find what did you call it a vase is a vase and a vas the same thing same thing oh wow you nailed it and you just cool if you say one and you're me if you say the other all right gotcha so you go you find you find the deal the sort of needle and a haystack type of thing and it's kind of thrift shopping but at a like high-end you know in a high-end way um and he's like yeah these are super resilient right now and there was a couple other categories like you know car repair things like that things that you couldn't take online um but he's basically isolated into these like super resilient ones that now are like oh we can go pick up Prime real estate everywhere because of this and I'm with you the Hobby Lobby 1.0 which is like the current Hobby Lobby is like you know half CVS half Home Depot or something like that it's not yeah exactly it doesn't look like Etsy or Instagram and I think if somebody just said which by the way you know that um that woman uh Joanna gains the chip chip and Joanna they have the now your churching up her name I think it's Joanna but we also know it Joanna either it's a Vas sort of situation so she's got Magnolia the store in Texas somewhere have you been wo yeah yeah I've been it's Fant I mean it's Disneyland for like middle-aged white women like me I think basically like damn you went middle-aged for yourself oh wow I know well now that I'm late 30s you know the Tik Tok tells me that's middleaged um but what's fascinating about Joanna gains is she she disrupted like three industries that people said they're dead magazines how you get a magazine that does hundreds of millions of dollars in total revenue from what's built around it that's wild and then she did it with uh act an actual retail space um and then she also did it with um well I guess Ecom isn't dying but she has an incredible Ecom business so two outv um so they would it be just like Magnolia but scaled is that like would that be a winning idea here well I think we could play some games here so I had a friend that used to run um gosh what was that store westm so she she used to run something called West Elm local and it was basically like here's West Elm but in in your local area you have cool little kind of like you said popup Etsy shops that are inside of West Elm and they're from local providers and the cool part about that is HomeGoods rotates its uh inventory almost entirely I think it's twice a week Tuesdays and Thursdays I don't know why I know that but I do and they and and West Elm local kind of did the same thing so they would bring in new clients because you would only be able to get this limited edition popup vase or whatever for each period um so I think that'd be cool you could try it like a 1.0 version it' be like could you do a pop in at Hobby Lobby could you try to talk them into like for instance Hobby Lobby is very Christian values American like the they have like Bible quot quotes up on the uh up on their headquarters I used to sell them in best my products back in the day and uh so you walk in your headquarters and it's like the Bible on the wall and um and so maybe you could talk them into like a local christian popup thing that would go into the store that could be like an easy little 1.0 way maybe not easy because you'd have to get B2B and then maybe you could do like a like a popup uh crafting one around a different holiday and then if you're big time like your friend with a billion bucks I would love to go into these where it just was a better shopping experience yeah I feel like um somebody should just take a house and they should just turn the house into the shopping experience basically like just stage the house and then you come in and you can just basically push a button and get any of these things delivered to your to your home from there um and you could even kind of like franchise that concept out just let let people kind of curate their their own uh the one the one thing though I'll say and I'd be curious we'll see if if AR agrees with me and others but like there's something about you go there and you get the thing so I don't even think we're not even that we'll give you a box we'll give you an empty box we want to leave with the candle we want to go put the flowers in the vase immediately um it's it's literally if you go to Tik Tok and scroll around for some fun times there's all this stuff about if your wife upset you just tell her like let's go to HomeGoods honey and like take her around and get her some candles oh that's a great idea yeah we going to write that down for later yeah no I don't even need to write that down that went straight to my core memory uh as like you know just default actually I'm going to do it preventatively every Friday just uh just in case um and it's cheap so there's that you had another one on here that I thought was interesting you said you tried to buy a Halloween Express oh yeah that's fascinating tell me why did you try to buy it and why is it a try sounds like you didn't end up buying it why not didn't end up buying it somebody else bought it um and um basically we tried to buy it because we saw it was $600,000 for a popup location and I should make sure I get this right but it was like three or four retail locations plus whatever last year's inventory was so there was like a lot of there there they already had the leases they already had the locations and it was right before Halloween explain so this is Halloween Express is like Spirit where it pops up for 60 days or something like that before Halloween and it just takes over a vacant space is that it well yes could take over a vacant sta space A lot of times they pre-negotiate the contracts but basically you know retail has so much data behind it usually they know like oh X percentage of these commercial strip malls will be open at any point in time so if we do a contract with Halloween Express this year there's likely going to be one location that's open and then the wild part about uh spirit and Halloween Express I always get the two confused but they have the same model which is like every store is 10,000 squ ft so they'll have a Target which is I don't know what 60 100,000 ft but they only take up 10,000 ft inside of the store and if you've ever been in one they kind of throw up these real it's like drapes basically and you know racks for clothing that you could buy uh online cuz they're just trying to standardize the the the roll out of the store quickly and cheaply exactly exact it's like it's like the Ikea uh Furniture of stores you know it's like every single time we put it in the Box you have the list of things that you need and it's up in in uh well we talked to a contractor who could do the buildout for us and he said that those things go up in a matter of sometimes days which he said would be aggressive but like two weeks he's like two weeks you can have an entire Halloween Express app which is wild because a normal store is months if not a year to throw up so anyway we tried to buy this one kind of for shits and giggles because uh I thought we could make cool content around it and then maybe we could try to sell it um and I wanted to understand the business model and then somebody else spot it out from under us basically but uh that's when I went down to this deep Rabbit Hole of oh my God the average uh commercial let's call it retail store costs Millions to throw up and takes months and spirit or Halloween Express costs maybe1 to $50,000 to throw up and is up in days or weeks so just like speed to execution has to make this a much more interesting business model so how much would a business like that make let's say you buy one of these uh businesses and this was you said three locations for 600k plus the inventory so you're right like uh that's a lot um the what would you what do you what would one of those locations net um do you think at the end of that se in Halloween season well I think they said that it was somewhere around a million dollar so three locations inside of they're open for two months a year they would bring in a million dollar I think it's 950 or something like that that's Revenue though right that's Revenue that's right now the margins on those businesses that they claimed were 30 to 45% that seems way too high for me I'm guessing the margins on it are like typical 10 to 20% margin on that kind of business which means if I bought it I guess it depends on how much inventory was in there we never got to go deep on the due diligence side but depending on how much inventory is in there um if we did this type of business you could B basically be in the clear inside of two or three years um you could be in the black and so that's kind of let's do those numbers so you said a million dollar for one location Revenue a million dollars for this whole business so that would be three locations M cool so a million dollars and then you're saying maybe let's just split the difference there 20% net so 200k and you're saying that they uh you're buying it for 600k including the inventory so you're saying couple years and you're um you are uh you're you broken even on your investment you you've returned your Capital but what you're saying is that these things that like to just run these things you have to buy new inventory every year so you'd have to inject how much working capital you think to to do a million dollars in sales maybe like 150k or 200k well the so the interesting part to me about Halloween is theoretically a lot of the inventory is the same so they said that they have about 10 to 15% of the inventory is like the new Concepts so like the the the euphoria outfit for instance as opposed to the witches the Lions the wardrobes whatever people do each year and so yeah if we think that the inventory for that place was probably you know $200,000 $250,000 in inventory that they had you know yeah probably each year you're paying like $50 to $100,000 in like the net new inventory then you can roll some over um but yeah I don't I mean the problem is I didn't get to actually do it so I don't know the true numbers but that's seems that seems reasonable yeah yeah okay uh all right fair enough okay so Halloween store interesting you have a couple other ones on here that I just don't know anything about but I want to hear what you have to say you wrote the words fantasy werewolf romance novel what you talking about yeah so we have a we have a group where we all buy businesses together and um this one uh lady comes on and she's like I bought a um romance novel book company so they write them they distribute them and they Market them sort of three three levels to the business I was like that's fascinating and she started explaining some of the titles and then she's kind of a funny character and so she was like the thing is romance romance werewolves huge category like biggest growing category and I was like okay um talk to me about that and she basically said of all the titles that she has uh I can't remember how many she had but let's say like 25 30 titles that she bought the outselling ones the 8020 rule for her 25 to3 book business were this fantasy romance category and then because I'm a woman and I also read books I was like let's look at my thing like do I ever read this category and it turns out I'm a fantasy reader and some of them have werewolves in them so I was like this is weird am I weird is she weird or is this category and then I went and researched it and I think you guys have covered this before but there's like $1.3 billion are sold of Romance Books a year and uh and it's huge it's like almost in some cases you know a quarter to half of the entire industry um but the part that that got me the most was realizing romance is growing hugely but it's with like were the target audience my age so like somewhere in the realm of uh 18 to let's call it 45 which used to be like the long-haired Fabio romance novels that used to be the deal and I guess now this fantasy level is taking over um and what's interesting is you can kind of tell because if you look up the best selling books of all time Harry Potter 500 mil Twilight 160 50 Shades 150 there're there's like kind of morphing together and so I'm curious to see what happens next but I kind of like this industry I can't really see you writing a werewolf fantasy novel Sean but maybe maybe as a stunt you know that Sam wrote a romance novel once you know that story oh I forgot about that he or did he write it or did he ghost they like ghost wrote it so basically same sort of observation he's like you know when people are like oh Amazon bestseller and then it's like everybody in their mom is Amazon bestseller he like what does this word mean actually uh you know it's like in the bottom of the power rankings of meaningful titles it's like Forbes 30 and 30 and even below that is Amazon bestseller because it means nothing and so um what he found was that to be a bestseller you basically pick some Niche category and then for a day you know you uh sell you know a th000 copies or something like that at $99 cents and you've become a besteller you screenshot that you're you're a bestseller you get the flag some version of that so it's like it's a very like gamified thing you there's all these subcategories so you're you're trying to just get to the number one inside health health and wellness Inside by a new emerging author or whatever you know like there's all these subcategories so he found somebody who had done this they were B they were baking good money like tens of thousands a month I think selling um romance novels on Amazon on just ebooks and so he commissioned somebody to write one uh or he wrote like a couple and it was like boss and a it was like a boss and a secretary and then another one was like a a werewolf in a something and um he commissioned somebody to write it and then they wrote it and they did it they hit the Amazon bestseller it's out there somewhere you can find this if he just no does he still make money on that uh no no no not anymore I think they took it down uh that's incredible well I mean honestly if you go and you by the way the blog post is called confessions From The scammy Underground world of Kindle books and so um his book was called Untamed billionaire undressed virgin Jesus Sam sometimes that guy that's incredible that is incredible he has way better historical business uh Shenanigans he's done than me oh wait wait no no sorry sorry got to clear clear the record that wasn't his that was the name of somebody else's his was called captivating CLA and the cover is this really ripped black guy and then the secretary and it says a firsttime billionaire romance okay there we go that's slightly better I like the other story better I think we should cut this part and just tell everybody the other one was his name I think uh I think that's the move but you know what's fascinating is when you go to like so if you go to your bookstore and you look up uh top charts free I mean this category is everywhere and then to your the point that I thought was interesting is the move I didn't realize the the Amazon bestseller thing that's why they put it up for 99 the reason that I thought and this lady was telling me is you put one up for 9 cents or free you get it on the top free list and then you Hammer these things out so you have 472 versions of Fabio the Fantastic werewolf and uh the the likelihood that people are going to buy all of those in the series is apparently incredibly high and so um I thought that was fascinating and a lot of these authors like if you look at them they have 50 books out which must mean somebody's ghost riding for them so I don't think you could do it any other way yeah or like chat GPT uh by the way you know the story of 50 Shades of Gray not like the story but like the backstory how it came to be uhuh oh this is crazy so uh I don't know if you've ever seen the what's it called the big fanfiction site watpad uh it just sold it's like a Canadian company so what happened is uh Twilight comes out it's a vampire story it's great um and then somebody goes on watpad and writes a fanfiction version of Twilight basically and that was the early the V1 of 50 Shades of Gray people liked it and it became and then somebody picked it up and it they re kind of branded it as its own thing instead of as a Twilight fanfiction as its own brand and it became like you know whatever the third or fifth or whatever bestselling book of all time started as a fanfiction blog on a on watpad I think well it it makes sense actually because it's all just sort of copyrighting in some way what you know Joseph Campbell talks about the hero's journey right and everybody basically use that uses that from the Bible to Star Wars to you know Twilight Etc I mean the other thing that I remember so I actually went to to a high school that was right next to and so we were close with the high school of the the woman who W wrote Twilight Stephanie and I remember when it was going wild that wasn't my category and so um I like reached out to her and was like hey like congratulations on your first book I'm so excited for you you know I just wanted to let you know like I bought a few books for you you know help out and then retrospect and then I like looked at her say I was like oh cool cool cool anyway I'm go respond I no I don't know I don't think she did but you know what Stephanie I was I was here for you from the beginning yeah actually not from the beginning though that's the bad part is it was already successful um that's really good okay so let's um let's do one more that's in this uh the segment that you called Gets mogen In This [ __ ] have we gotten enough estrogen I don't know we got to get one more idea in here go pick okay how about one that I think could be a billion dooll business but I don't have the how so the MFM listeners are super smart maybe you guys can figure out the how um you know lots of our friends and I don't know if you experienced any of this Sean but getting pregnant these days is like hard you know when we were young I remember it was like yeah if you look at that guy sideways like pregnant you know shake hands pregnant everybody's pregnant and then as you get older apparently it's like now impossible and I've experienced this first hand it's like expensive you know you go to the doctors and then you have these different apps and then you're tracking 472 different things and the whole experience is like awful and uh expensive and so I think there's a huge opportunity to do something in it because once that little box gets checked like a woman is ready to have a baby or whatever like I don't know we turn into crazy people we'll do whatever it takes you know you guys have Sam was telling me some crazy stuff he was telling Sarah I'm like I don't think that's true about how to get pregnant and um anyway so for instance there's this company called mea and it has this little like egg shaped tester and this is like a little TMI but like you pee on a stick and it tells you how fertile you are whatever and the Sean I kid you not when I open the app and I'm not a total idiot uh like I can't tell what I'm tracking and I can't tell what's happening here there are no notifications there are no gam ifications in it and they charge you it's like $50 for the the sticks that they send you and then it's like somebody should check my math on this I'm I'm definitely wrong on the number but it's like 150 to 200 bucks for this tiny little plastic egg that has to be created in in China and and that's it and uh I never saw an ad for this it's all like Word of Mouth referral so I don't know what crazy ideas you have but I feel like the people from MFM should this okay let's uh let's brainstorm on the Fly here so uh first of all when you started saying there was like this little egg shaped thing I thought where you were going was uh like you said like a sort of a smart device but so you you pee on the stick it tells you kind of where you're at in your cycle but how cool would that be as a little bedside replacement to your alarm clock when it glows hey it's time it's time to get busy uh and you you can see based on the light so that's a little more tasteful than these apps that are like your you know your your ESG levels are spiking right now or whatever it's like it's like uh let's just let's just add a little bit of romance to this process that becomes very very clinical and so I'm thinking bedside egg bedside uh replacement to the alarm clock okay that's idea number one idea number two have you ever heard of a Flow app yes it's I think it's the it's flow. Health it's the most popular pregnancy period tracking app in the world like their website gets like 8 million uniques a month or or something like that crazy um last I had heard they were doing something like 30 million-ish in in ARR which is pretty Bonkers for a mobile app and way more than you would think a niche mobile app like this would do that was like five years ago that I heard that number I would not be surprised if Flo was doing you know uh like 100 million let me just go search the revenue see if it if it's out now yeah and how much they're worth cuz I couldn't also figure out the valuation on these companies like me's got to be can you imagine you get me at a point where you're going to know the second that a woman is pregnant which is the highest likelihood of uh purchasing intent you could have right and like what would that data be worth and then also you could sell the data to every medical provider imaginable uh and have add-ons and affiliate deals for X supplement X thing you got to drink or whatever yeah I I agree with you it's extremely valuable sort of stage that's a that's a Time bound stage where you're you're become pretty price insensitive uh as you as you've noticed so yeah Flo um over over three 300 million people have downloaded the app revenues over 100 million for this app it's a billion dollar app uh that started off as a period tracking Tracker app it started off as like such a simple little mobile app at the time so so you know props to these guys I think they're in Europe uh that built this thing so uh I think the mobile app space is was obviously you know kind of like one winner in this other ideas I think are interesting so somebody said this to me the other day and I know nothing about this I put it on my list of like to research but I haven't gotten around to it so I'll just say the the 1% of the idea that I have ready which is she goes somebody was talking me she goes do you know how hard it is for a gay couple to adopt a baby I said sure don't I have no idea how hard is it is it very hard she's like nearly impossible and she goes if you if anybody created a company that just helped gay male gay couples um adopt babies uh you know because they're usually that's like a very rich segment is like uh gay male couples it's like one of the highest like sort of average uh like household incomes uh obviously super high need or like no price sensitivity when it comes time and convoluted low NPS um process and so I think if somebody just went and interviewed like a 100 couples that were trying to adopt right now I bet you could find some I bet you could find a $500 million to a billion dollar business out of a 100 interviews of those couples and I don't know what that idea is yet but I that's enough of a map for somebody to go you know find their own um immunity idol to use my Survivor references it's a good point I mean it's sort of I've been messing around lately thinking about levels to the game of business like how it it would be interesting to categorize all businesses as what level on a let's call it just a multiple uh and margin level if you just say like what multiple could you get for this business and how high of margins do you get for this business and maybe like how reasonable would it be for you get to I don't know 10 million or 100 million whatever your goal post would be um and I think like a level one business a lower tier business that would be probably profitable on like day 1 to 30 would be helping just on the Consulting aspect of that because you're right I have a friend that paid $25,000 for help navigating the adoption process in Texas and they I should figure out what the name of the the thing is that they asked for but they paid a huge chunk of money just to help them figure out how to get higher on the lists for adoption in Texas so if that exists there's got to be 32 different ways to do Consulting for adoption in this space yeah yeah basically anybody who's like U clear like in the airports but for all life processes not just lines at the airport so it's like uh somebody's doing this right now I saw for H1B visas they're like again like if you're an immigrant in the United States applying for a Visa is literally like one of the like two things that keeps you up at night um and so there's people that are like we're just each want be like concierge um like we know this process inside out you don't you're just sitting here Googling reading forums we know how to expedite some timelines we know where you should pay money we know where you shouldn't worry because it's just this is normal this is part of the standard delay we know when you put your put together your application like how to which order to staple it together so that you have the best chance of success and I find that like for these really complex workflows that are high ticket and high desire like adopting a child like getting your Visa uh people are willing to pay you know whatever 10 grand 20 grand in order to do it um obviously it's you know the Richer segment there but but that that's and so you could go buy the lead for this you know you could advertise and get the lead for this uh you know through Google for maybe two grand a lead but you're making 20 grand per person off that that comes out of that funnel that's smart well even we both invested you invested in h Health too right yeah I invested in them also and part of the the stuff that I think is really smart with what they're doing is just it's such a pain to get uh access to those type of you know trt and and different things that men want um and do it in a legal way and really be able to trust what you're getting and so there's probably a bunch of that inside the the women's space too home I keep telling them they should launch something for women because I think it's a really underserved market and if you think about it you know me men sort of dominate most of the dieting Trends in general so you had like Tim Ferris normalize keto and so I tried keto for a while and then I went to I now have a doctor Gabrielle lion who's a stud and she's like the thing is that doesn't work as well for women I'm like no no I read the book I'm a huge T Ferris fan and it just turns out a lot of that stuff males men and women are biologically different um and so yeah I think there's lots of cool ways to play in that space also like with stuff like uh peptides although those are getting federally banned so maybe not the best idea right now pepti is getting federally banned yeah we should check my homework on that but that's the word from from the husband is is it like OIC a peptide well my understanding is most of the reason why peptides are getting banned is because they are hard to uh patent and so um because of that there's you know conspiracy theorists like big farma doesn't like that and so they're getting a lot of push back but my husband's like number one Advocate thinks everybody should be on peptid should do research on it yeah semi so semaglutide which is OIC or we that's the generic name semaglutide is a peptide um but yeah I don't think that can get banned I think uh people will ride in the streets right now if OIC got banned um you also just we'll close out this section you wrote uh life partner hack from from woman to a man from a woman to a man dot dot dot what what's your what's your hack yeah well this also my husband yeah his his hack is that uh the best money he's ever spent on being in a marriage is a subscription to flowers on a monthly basis for your wife and I totally stand by this because it's cheap there's this one I would use called far farm girl flowers I don't have any affiliation I'm not an investor um but it's like beautifully little burlap tide bow Etc and um and comes every single month you don't have to think about it you get Auto gifts for your wife and I'm pretty sure I'll I'll take any I'll take almost any guarantee that there will never be a wife that would be mad if they got this on a consistent basis but but husbands are just not going to remember consistently so like do yourself a solid and just you know buy some flowers on a consistent basis okay this is interesting so first of all what's the deal with flowers why do girls love flowers so much uh is there does it do something for you is it just like a mood brightener when you see it in the room what is the actual appeal here cuz if I see flowers nothing needle doesn't move doesn't do anything inside like a candle like if I smell a candle I'm in um you know if uh I don't know if we buy like a nice uh little piece of art I like it I see it it does something for me flowers I just don't get it what is the why what is the is it the flowers or is it this man loves me is that what it is it's just like reassurance it's definitely not the love part flowers actually the flowers it's uh that could be both no I think when you're in a relationship yeah it's lovely you're just like oh you know it's such a low if you think about high Roi low as pain number one winner like number one winner um but I I think it's actually just we like plants and flowers I don't know if that's a pre you know genetic disposition or if um you know society's patriarchy is upon us but like women like flowers and so I don't know what the thing is but also the fact that like I remember when I was younger Sean like I don't I can't remember if you've ever said one on here but when I was young and I had no money there was very low hanging fruit things for what a rich person would have and one of them was like one day I'll have fresh flowers in my house every single day and that'll mean I'm super rich and okay so I think there's a part of it that's also just like this is such a moment right and this is just for me I can't speak to anybody else but now when I see them I'm like oh it means we're doing okay you know and even if it's on a subscription and you know he didn't think he thought about it once three years ago it doesn't matter you just want the flowers love it okay just want the flowers okay I'm going to report back I'm going to try this report and report back don't tell her I don't care and I just set it up on subscription three years ago no no qualifiers okay well you know no guarantees with me all right so um let's go to the the small business acquisition stuff so first explain your business model so you got a media business which is you create content and your your output is insane like I put you um Pomp and sahill I feel like are so consistent and so omnipresent everywhere and so consistent with your message it is unbelievable to me I can't I I can't imagine myself even doing that even though I call myself a content creator in comparison to you guys I'm nothing I'm just a guy uh you know who talks to his friend Sam twice a week so like the way you guys do it is crazy that's a media business that can be profitable on its own people maybe advertise subscribe I think you have like a paid Community or something like that that people pay for I think that's pretty lucrative right like that's a big money maker for you yeah well a couple different things one thing that's interesting of those three people you picked what's the common denominator between all three of us we were all in finance which is categorically a [ __ ] miserable industry in to be end for the most part and we all I think all of us did private Equity or Investment Banking which means that we had crazy crazy hours for a long time right and so anytime like somebody talks to me like I always kind of gigo and the creators are like I'm burnt out I'm like from filming Tik toks like for a couple hours I think we're fine that tweet fatigued you yeah it's totally we're going to be okay and so I think probably we're good at output because anything that can be like mechanized systematized and replicated consistently Finance people are usually pretty good so you you have the content business and then you have your buying businesses stuff is there a third part of what you do like just passive investing or anything like that or those the two things that you do well I guess we have sort of three different businesses now so one is the content business which is the one that's super public um and we kind of stubbled into that I think only two years ago so that would like the latter part of 2020 is when uh we started creating a business around content and I was in private Equity at the time when I started that and then um that today is comprised of like newsletter we have a community we have uh a bunch of different media channels and now I guess a couple newsletters uh we have a course on buying businesses and we do a little bit of AD sponsorship stuff but I don't I don't really love that I think we're going to change the model to only talk about the products of the businesses we own and our own products so I'm kind of messing around with that looking at like how the daily wire does it for instance um and then the second business we have is what was the family office what's now Main Street holding company and that is like the small businesses that I talk about so we've owned everything from podcast production businesses to um graphic design agencies to laundromats to car washes to is your own money this is you raised money what happens my own money so it's your own money you're using to buy these and so that's a portfolio you said there's three businesses what's the third and the third is we have a venture capital fund and then we also have I guess you know alongside that my own passive Angel Investments or whatever and so those would be like homeone Health we did in the Venture fund um we invested in Andrew Wilkinson's media companies that was just a personal investment that I did it didn't go into the to the VC company so that's where like our minority Investments go okay and when did you get rich was it uh after all this were you rich before you started all this what was the like where was your kind of like like okay the podcast called my first millon when did you make your first millon was it in the private Equity uh Investment Banking world or was it after that when you went on your own no I made my first million when I was working for other people I'm like the opposite of VI I'm not really as I was rist scares me actually so like I could have never gone and done what like Sean and Sam did which is start a business like Sam did have no money uh sleep on a couch like corosi and then like hope that business turns into 160 million that like scares me too much I'm a wuss and so I worked in corporate for a long long long time I ran a bunch of the businesses I became a partner in them and so I made Millions before I ever really ran my own thing by myself and I was actually so scared to leave the big corporate I don't know canopy that uh I bought businesses while I was still working for somebody else you say you bought businesses these are like the like I bought a Car Wash Laundromat type of thing or what what type of businesses you buying yeah well I bought some back in the day that I bought but they didn't make me any money was like I bought a website I bought a fashion styling Market Place those threads refined back in the day uh I bought another one called s South but the ones that started making me real money were the boring ones like I tried the sexy things websites and I wasn't very good at them and then it was oh wait if I buy aundre mat I it's I have a hard time [ __ ] this thing up like I can make some money on that and I can have somebody else run it and and if I pay that somebody else and then we have three or four or five of them that's enough money for them to make a good living and me to make a good living and then maybe we could do that exact same thing in a bunch of different sectors and I just back then when I was doing that that was not cool now I feel like it's kind of cool the holding company thing is cool on Twitter right uh in fact I didn't tell anybody that I owned laundr bats one I thought I might get fired because it's could be considered a conflict of interest so I was concerned about that and then uh secondly I didn't think it was that cool you know at the time I was like running the Latin American Investment business and so we had a billion dollars in assets under management I built the thing from zero for this company called First Trust and everybody thought that job was really cool including my parents they're like super proud but I hated it was going through divorce and was working like 70 hours a week and on red eyes to Chile basically weekly and so I bought the businesses to get the [ __ ] out of corporate and then when I finally replaced my income is when I I thought oh well now I'm going to take a jump and become a partner at a private Equity Fund and then finally I got the balls to go do it all by myself but it took me a long time to get there yeah that's everybody's got their their path I I always joke like you hear these stories like oh Mark cubin when he was six years old started a newspaper route and then a lemonade stand and then hired his friends I'm like dude I didn't even know the word business till I was 19 you know you definitely don't need to you know you everybody's got a different starting point uh so that's for sure so you um uh list talk about the laundry mat thing I've told the story on the Pod before but I was at a dinner once with this guy who uh was a CEO of a public company and he was like he he was like fast he's like you know you know people are like really busy they don't use social media so he's like um he's trying to relate to me so he's like oh you do podcast what's what's the name and I I can say he doesn't even know where the podcast app is because he's like does real work for a living and so he's like um he's like I'll definitely subscri can you show me how how do you subscribe to a podcast I've always wanted to know and I'm like wow this guy's like you know just getting going and one of the things he said he's like he's like you know I see these people on Instagram talking about laundromats and he's like are we all just [ __ ] stupid and we should just be buying laundromats or are they stupid and they they think laundromats are a great business he's like it's what who's stupid he's like I'm worried I'm stupid and that I shouldn't be doing all this like stressful work running this like company with thousands of employees do I just need to go buy four laundromats and chill like is that actually the answer and so he was uh laughing about it he's like it can't be that good and I was like dude I honestly don't know what to say never bought one of these boring businesses don't intend to own a ALR mat Albuquerque or whatever like that's not my my jam but it is for some people and you obviously are an advocate for it so this is your opportunity so so educate me drop some knowledge on me okay what is this deal with buying you can pick either actually do laundromat not car wash because I I actually know the car wash is a little bit but let's do laundromat yeah um I call these gateway drug businesses so basically no if you're a billionaire you shouldn't go buy laundromat this is a terrible idea the reason I talk about it is because I have a belief that I think a lot of people don't have that almost anybody could have a business that they currently work as a job let's say and have some ownership in that business and in fact the world would be a lot better off if we all had a little bit of skin in the game that's like my little Hill that I want to die on and um and so when I first started talking about this I was like the thing is I've been in finance like I went through all the levels and we want everybody else to think that we're smarter than them when we're in finance and we're actually not because the worst part about running a laundromat is not reading the p&l the worst part about running the laundromat is like the machine breaks what do you do there's a homeless person there like how do you handle that somebody breaks into uh to your laundr mat and breaks the glass door and like a any human could handle that and so um I talked about laund maths one because that is one of the first businesses I bought so it just was you know recency bias and then two because I think if you can't understand take a coin putting in a machine getting out clean clothes or dry clothes from it and running that business model you probably shouldn't run a business it's like a very simplistic business model um but this is why I've been obsessing on levels to the game the problem with laundromats are they're a terrible business if you're really good at business so like if you're good at business the the laundromat I invested in one laundromat it wasn't one that I owned complete uh control of that did $3 million a year that's the biggest laundr map that I've ever seen individually that's Revenue what is that that's Revenue so $3 million a year okay let's get out my calculator so this is is it like one of these like jumbo like uh like I've seen some of these laundromats that look like full-on shops or something like that they're like huge yeah it's a very big laundromat so it's doing like eight grand a day yeah they do 15% margins and the way they do them is actually through the wash and fold business not the walk-in laundry business okay gotcha and so the real business where the higher level customers are and where you make more money is you know single mom wants to put her bag of of clothes outside of her door you pick it up you wash it you drop it back off it requires cars and Logistics and some oversight it's more complex the average laundr mat makes somewhere around 100 to $500,000 a year like that's what aund matat makes at 15 to 10 to 15% margins um and there's like not that much you can do once you have a laundromat to get a to get a laundr map that's doing 100,000 to 500,000 it's really hard it's location depending or what's the bottleneck there yeah location dependent also just demographics of of your you know segment so if you're in a a poor neighborhood Wash and Fold might not be as much of a driver right for you if you're in a higher end neighborhood it could be um competition um so those are making you know between you know 20 and $50,000 a year for the owner yep that's right um so you got like you know you have to do multiple of these otherwise if you own one you're working the job of an owner but making the wage of a you know minimum wage employee or something so so you want to own multiple that would be the the play here well I think it depends this is where I think business acquisition gets interesting it's like who are you and what do you want everybody always asks me like what's the best sector to buy and I'm like that's a dumb question the best sector to buy is like the one that's uniquely aligned to you so what was it for you what was it for you the reason I bought the laundr mat is cuz I had the operator that already knew how to run laundromats and had found one that we could buy for very cheap and I was like I don't like a lot of risk I could I could front 100K okay uh buy this and then if we run that and that works let's get three to five of them and get rolling but like a lot of people that I talk to you know maybe you're a teacher and you have six months off during the year and then why wouldn't you own a little laundromat and then I like to compare it versus houses or like short-term rentals so like average short-term rentals we should check my numbers but does somewhere like $120 $160 in net income a month and you put up $250,000 on average for one of those homes so like compare a single family home for 250k versus a laundromat for 100k and this one's making you 30 $50,000 a year and uh I'm sorry 20 to $40,000 a year and this one's making you a couple thousand dollars a year that's actually kind of a good that's a better risk-reward trade-off and so I think it just depends um and then the other thing I think is you start with one business and not a lot of not a lot of Americans are probably like your listeners a lot of Americans like haven't run a big business before wouldn't know what to do with a tech business and so them starting with something pretty simple in their local community and then they go okay I know how to run this I made 20 to 50K on it I didn't risk my house by buying too big of a business or starting too big of a business now I go and sell this to somebody else and do a bigger Endeavor at least that's how I think about it so your the first business you bought was a laundromat or was it something else my very first business was a website back so all right so you bought the website stuff then you went brick and mortar after that yeah brick and mortar laundr was my first brick and mortar business what did you do after that after that we bought a couple of them so we bought multiple laundr mats uh and then we kept buying laundr mats how many laundr mats did you buy in total I probably owned like 25 or 30 laundr mats over my career of launder Ming uh but but that first little portfolio was probably seven or eight okay and I was working full-time at the time I was at a company called First Trust then mostly in Latin America so I couldn't do too much with it back then and give me the best deal you ever did and the worst deal you ever did the best let's see the worst deal I did um we had one business entirely go under um so we invested in a business where we got lied to stolen from um that was a small business that supported other small businesses uh from a tax and accounting perspective so they didn't do the taxes but they did bookmark uh bookkeeping and kind of funny that they would be the ones to do the stealing right but that's the biggest issue on buying small businesses and I think I lost I probably lost a couple hundred K on that deal and the biggest issue with buying small businesses is that you run out of cash because they either lied to you about the business that you bought and how much money it has in it or or they lied by Omission they didn't quite realize you know that they needed to share this with you or they didn't actually track their finances very well and so you ended up buying something you didn't want so that that one I got stolen from but a lot of times the small businesses do not actually have the finances that I that I think they do what about the best deal yeah the best deal that I've ever did was probably uh mostly from the land acquisition um so we basically bought a a big plot of land that had an RV park on it um also like a series of vending machines also like a little area for people to to camp and you know uh go into nature whatever um and that business the appreciation of the land ended up being what what paid the most for it so that business made us a few million bucks which is kind of cool and we definitely didn't put that in right um and maybe the other business that I think will be my best deal ever is a series of car washes we bought because ever since this company called Mr Car Wash went public the tune of billions of billions of dollars multiples went up oh [ __ ] I mean we've gotten offers that are just wild on these so I don't want to I want to knock on wood that that one actually goes through but we sold out of a bunch of our laundr mats at Great multiples and I think we'll sell out of our car washes at at really really good multiples but I don't always talk about my best deals because it's like I don't think you should get into these with an idea that you're going to have some crazy exit like you're going to cash flow that's the goal you cash flow and if you want to have a crazy multiple exit buying these tiny businesses unless you scale them up in a big way is probably not going to be the way to do it and me and Ben were debating this the other day we were talking about like uh what's a good uh on the finance side what's a good Northstar goal and we were saying uh we just thw we threw out a bunch of ideas two of the ideas were um should we build up $10 million a year of annual cash flow as the goal out of this hold Co or should we just try to build $100 million portfolio value that's realized realized portfolio value in roughly you know the same amount of time and of course like if you have $10 million of cash flow you could probably sell it for $100 million so it's not like these were totally different but you would maybe buy different things because if you're trying to get to 100 you might not buy things you could buy things that don't cash flow you could just start a business if it doesn't that's not not about cash flow but if you need cash flow you have to go a certain route um I'm curious two things a what would be your opinion on that and B what's the goal for you what do you what do you set as your kind of North Star your summit uh that you're trying to trying to climb up to yeah well what what do you mean by realized value you mean you actually want to sell it and then get 100 million from it or you want a third party to mark it up and say that it is worth $100 million the way I thought about it there was that it's um sold or sellable in a kind of more bulletproof way versus like one business that on paper got marked up by one investor but you know not really a liquid it's not a profitable business so you know you couldn't actually exit for that amount um which is often like the Silicon Valley how you get a $100 million valuation but you could never sell that business for $100 million type of thing so not that not the paper valuation but either it's exited or you know if you ran a process for for 60 to 90 days with 80% certainty you could get that value yeah well um for me I have an issue which is that I'm pretty ADHD I like to do a lot of different things like if you look at my work history I think the longest I ever stay at a job was like five and a half years or something like that and I was moving from different investment firms every two years or so so I kind of like the portfolio approach because it allows me to be ADHD in a bunch of different businesses and so I get to like pop in and pop out um theoretically if I wanted to build a billion dollar business you could argue that if I have a great idea that I really really love that would be a better way to get to a billion dollars um I just haven't had an idea that I was that obsessed with that I thought was fun that I still need to do because I you know I'm pretty comfortable I have I have enough cash to do sort of what I want now um so I think our goal has always been I kind of buy my own [ __ ] which is for a long time I thought I was going to just build a bunch of foreign businesses into my little tiny version of KKR or Berkshire hathway and I was going to build up this this thing and then you know I did that for like 15 years working for other people and then I did it for a couple more years by myself and I got to this point where I was like I actually do not think it is good for the really really few people to own everything I think it is much better experientially and just for society when you go to a local coffee shop then when you go to Starbucks nightmare I refuse to go to Starbucks we have like a company policy you're not allowed to buy from Big corporate chains and so I kind of thought man if I go and build this thing that I what happens if someone does walk in with a Starbucks what do you do you just hit it out of their hand smack that [ __ ] onto the floor actually Tanner who's here right now knows that he walked into my place in California we lived there for some of the year with two Starbucks and I just looked at him and I was like what are we doing here and he was like and then the next week because I have a good team I ordered Chipotle on accident and so then I had to then I had to pay for my own chipot tan said the f word what cappuccino it's like h i um yeah I don't know I think once you start making up money like at some point you're like I want my money to mean something and I want all this work to mean something and um so I was like I don't want to own a billion dollar portfolio of small businesses and become everything that I talk [ __ ] about that does that doesn't feel that great and instead what we'll do is we're starting to buy a lot more businesses in the three cities that I'm really involved in which is San Diego uh Austin and Phoenix and so I want to own where I live that seems to make sense to me and feel good and then I cash FL off that and then the second thing I want to do is I'm going to go really aggressively all in on I'll ask you and Sam about it later if you what you guys think but we're going to plow a couple million bucks and we're going to raise a couple million bucks on one bet which I've never done before I've never raised for any of my I've raised for some of my funds obviously but never for a single company so I'm sort of nervous but I think we have an opportunity like to start or to buy I bought the company already as an MVP and then I'm going to build something on top of it and I'm going to put in a new CEO uh and I'm working right now and recruiting that CEO for this this business and I'm guessing can't talk about that right now not yet not that anybody really cares on the internet but you guys you guys MF mmers are doers so I feel like if I do there'll be 37 copycats by Monday hell yeah there will be that's what we do we destroy all the margins for all of us collectively we destroy Alpha left and right all right so you um so that's the game you're playing you're wait so sorry you told me the game you're not playing you're not playing the private Equity build the next KKR game you're building the own businesses where I live I got that part of it but that doesn't seem like the complete picture what's the rest of the game and how does like well we have a portfolio that you could I mean it depends how you value it but let's say it's it's worth about 75 to100 million in in um lolio value right now a lot of car wash that's a lot lot of soap baby and then so we have that and that's cool um really cool young Cody would be like that's [ __ ] wild um the next game we're going to play is a really big single bet and so um we'll have those two things and why why not just retire and be Trad wife and pumpkins and live laugh love dude honestly I bought those pumpkins and I was painting them and it brought me no joy whatsoever it brought me zero joy and I remember I called my husband afterwards and I was like I feel nothing and I must be dead inside and so um like I have to buy this pumpkin company for this to have been worth it as a hobby yeah exactly it's like so something's wrong with me I also think you do you like do you have hobbies SE yeah I got Hobbies I I I got Hobbies I love to play basketball but my hobbies are oh yeah you do they're things that um fall into like really specific categories so not I I don't have uh Niche Hobbies like some people are like oh I love um you know studying duck calls and I have all these little duck Kazo or whatever the hell mine are not nich like that they're very common things I like playing poker I like basketball I like working out I like you know like I like [ __ ] that everybody likes right I'm like the basic [ __ ] of like Hobbies however um I like to do them in a certain way that makes them more fun to me so for example uh I got a lot of Joy building a home gym and having a trainer who's like my boy who comes over and we work out here and then friends who we meet will come drop in for workouts with us and so I get to like hang out with my friends when I do that so I try to build a lifestyle around it or like basketball instead of just going playing pickup basketball 24- Hour Fitness we do this thing called Camp MFM where we rent a house rent a gym fly in you know a bunch of awesome Founders or kind of like celebrity people who love to play basketball and an NBA trainer and we spend the weekend pretending we're NBA players right like we cosplay and so I will try to take the Hobbies basic Hobbies but do them common hobbies in an uncommon way is what's done it for me um as far as being being a fun thing to invest in I like that well yeah I need to I need Hobbies basically I have none uh I like to work out I like to hang out with like friends that like literally have the most boring Hobbies imaginable I really actually like working a lot which is probably pretty sick um but my husband is like Captain Hobby he's so good he's like a [ __ ] black belt and Jiu-Jitsu or a purple belt or something and he's you know former Navy SEAL so he's amazing at shooting him and Sam are always hobing and I'm not I'm surprised Sam hangs out with him because Sam uh wants to always be able to kill everybody in the room or whatever he always says and your husband would eat him as an appetizer he's Sam is tapas for him like this is nothing so I'm surprised that Sam allows himself to be in the same room Sam does try to fight him a lot which is like a very Sam ISM you know like a son to his dad oh let's fight and then the dad's like okay sure let's play wrestle so yeah I'm going to tell you one tip for hobbies yeah tell me you want to get Hobbies there's two things that will force any person like us to get Hobbies the first hang out with people that are completely post-economic so people who are literally wealthier than wealthy because when you go to dinner with them they don't want to talk about business deals they're like completely not that they're over they still in the game of business it's just not interesting to them it's not what makes for a new conversation or it's not like it's no longer part of the status game CU they're they're also only with other people who are all very successful and so the status game then becomes oh my burning man camp was like this and oh my new hobby is to do this and oh I'm doing this crazy Health kick where I'm like you know taking blood from my feet and putting it into my arms it's crazy it's like you got to do the crazy thing outside of business because you've already like hit the ceiling on business craziness like you know the only one they want to talk to about business craziness is like what is Elon doing or whatever like that that is genuinely like gets the pulse going for them on the business side whereas most things don't so that's one way cuz I remember sitting at many dinners and feeling completely generic where the things I'm interested in the things that my brain has been working on to them are like yeah we know like we've yeah we've been doing that for 20 years now like that's not something to talk about right it's like talking about see my Twitter ad for my newsletter though yeah exactly I'm like I got the CPC down and they're like wow like I remember used to care about those things um so so that's one way to do it and the other is to go to a place where um like hang out with like like artists or Hollywood people we H with like actual artists for whom like the art is the goal and not the recognition from the go from the art um all they want to do like you set tell them what you're making and they're like oh that's cool like do you think that's cool and you're like no this is [ __ ] cringe and they're like so why are you doing it and you're like cuz it leads to outcomes and then they're like oh you know like you're like a it's like you value things so differently than an actual artist so two ways if you want to like round yourself out is uh immers and then the embarrassment will fuel you to find something that is a non um it's not about the a non work hobby yeah the thing that I have found about that is uh I don't actually care that much what people think and I find that hanging out with a lot of really really rich people like you and I both have I think a bunch of mutual friends that are super rich I'm like I don't care about your Pauly Amar Orgy at berning man like good fre dude I'm so excited that you were such a nerd in high school that now we're compensating for it with lots of free sex I think you should go wild but uh I don't think it's that [ __ ] cool actually so maybe I do maybe have one hobby which is that I um I really find uh like the political movements in the country interesting not like Republican versus Democrat but maybe that's my that's my toxic trait hobby that's your Roman Empire yeah yeah like I think we're part of this Think Tank called Ai and those people fascinate me like have you ever been around big thinkers that like you know like Arthur Brooks do you know who that is you guys should get him on here I wonder if You' like him I None of the words you just said the last minute even mean anything to me you said political movements that are not Republican I'm like what the hell is she talking about then the second thing you said is I'm part of a think tank uh what a what tank and then you said AI I'm like that's a wrestling league I think and then you just mentioned Arthur Brooks who I think might own the Atlanta Falcons but I'm pretty sure that's not him so can you go in reverse order what are political parties not the Democrats and Republicans so American Enterprise Institute has this one idea which is that uh all ideas should be in a competition there should be a competition for the best ideas and the best ideas should win in order to determine how we rule Our Lives what are our regulations and so they're bipartisan there's Democrats and Republicans in it and um and I'm part of a a group that donates every year and we go to a couple events for them and so that might be a hobby of mine I suppose they'll debate something like Ubi or something is that what you mean like is that the idea like like they'll have Dick Cheney and um Michelle Obama on a stage together and they'll be like ready go you know and they'll kind of compete their ideas and and it's closed doors and you can't video it um and you can't talk about the specific things that were talked about inside of there so it allows these politicians to be perhaps more uh realistic than they would be on the news sites so I find that to be really interesting kind of cool yeah I think you guys would like it and then um this guy Arthur Brooks who would be incredible he used to run Ai and was fascinated because he actually was like good friends with the dolly Lama which that's that's impressive but then simultaneously uh was able to pull together more funding like I think he raised tens and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars for AI and really change regulation on both the Democrat and Republican sides and he is if you can imagine what this is like like you go to this event all the most of the leaders of the Free World are there you fly into to a private airport and um in Sea Island and you go to this private Hotel there's all these securities it's like a little mini un and the guy who runs the think ttin is talking to a lot of since it's free markets and competition of ideas there's a lot of conservatives there and uh and he gets in front of the biggest conservative donors in the world and starts to talk to them about love and why love is the most important thing in the world which for conservatives is like non- normalized at all that that nobody wants to talk about that they want to talk about how all the Democrats are crazy and so um I really have a lot of respect for him he has like a bestselling book with Oprah now and uh and a documentary out about capitalism and so okay wow this guy yeah I see him posing with Oprah uh okay this is interesting and so you go to these like private um private events how much what's the what's the absolute minimum one us to donate in order to be invited to the private thingy I think it's 25 or 50k okay um you go through a screening process uh they're going to realize I don't I don't know anything don't give a [ __ ] about anything okay they prob they did I remember the first time I went they're like you do what where like they thought this whole internet CU they only been doing it for like probably three years uh so I told them that I I did little I wrote little blogs on the internet and they were like well that's huh cool it used to be my secret that I like don't care don't vote don't watch the news uh ever like not as like a general thing like just don't and um and I used to not say it because when I did people would look at me like oh so you're just like is some combination of you're dumb or selfish and they're like you're some combination of Dumb and selfish I don't really understand and I never really knew how to put it into words um because I was like I don't know I'm just focused yeah I'm on I focus on myself but not in a way that's selfish I'm not trying to take anything from anyone I just put my attention on the things in my life and um then somebody said this to me they go um they go yeah you you're an extreme in any one position you know just being all consuming watching the news 24/7 or never ever caring or paying attention to the news neither one of is probably very good but um to towards your end of the spectrum they go you know I think actually the world would be a better place instead of worrying about the government learning how to govern yourself and um and I really took that that like uh resonated with me because I was like oh that's exactly it uh I realize I can't even fully govern myself whether it's uh you know I shouldn't eat that and I go eat that or I should wake up early and I sleep in or um you know I want to text my friends and stay in touch but I forget about them and become consumed with what's going on in my life I've yet to even govern myself you who what am I worried about what's going on 3,000 mil away with other people I can't control at all let alone myself who I can't and so that was the first time I heard something that made me feel good about uh that where I I previously just felt a little embarrassed but not to the point where I was going to change my behavior because I was like I know intuitively this is right I just have no words to justify it well I always liked that I think it was Jordan Peterson that said um before you clean up the world clean up your room and so I think there is actually a true component to man if we actually all just took care of our own things and our own things could be our family or friends or community life would probably be a little bit better so um I support you in your purple non-blue non- red nature Sean yeah yeah yeah yeah and somebody also said this about relationships they go um uh the wrong way to think about relationships is they'll take care of I'll take care of you and you take care of me and then you're constantly feeling like you've lacked some care from the other side instead it's I'll take care of me for you and you take care of you for me um and I think that's just a much better mental model for how to be in a relationship is uh I will be the best I'm going to become the best person I can be for you and uh you do if you do the same then we're both going to end up in great shape and we both are focusing on the only thing we can control which is ourselves yeah yeah I love that well also I mean why you got to tell other people how to live that's my biggest complaint I'm like you do you and I'll do me and and even if you don't like it I was still going to do that anyway so uh you know thank God for freedom in that way okay I want to ask you about content so you have built um a big content brand across newsletters social media Tik Tok YouTube you're everywhere um give me the kind of can you do a rant on like what is your approach like you were Cody Sanchez but at some point you created Cody Sanchez the brand and um can you explain to me what went into that um because I think most people don't know what goes into that I think a lot of people try to take an a Shucks mentality and say I didn't really I hate I didn't think too much I just it just all sort of happened organically and anybody out there who would like to do the same is like great so I guess I'll just hope it all just happens um whereas I I think that most people do have some thought that they put into things and a strategy maybe that they put into things or um took a different approach than what they saw others were doing and it paid off I'd love to hear your version of that totally one I hate when people do that I have never met somebody that after you dig in a little bit didn't systematically try for the thing that they have created in any aspect of life like that don't [ __ ] buy it um so that's one of my big pet peeves um for me basically what happened is I think I'm the opposite of a lot of people that are public now so I raised a bunch of money before for my funds and built these big fund families right where we invested a lot hundreds of millions rais billions of dollars over my career not just for me when I was with other companies and what I kind of realized is that's a little bit like um giving a man a fish as opposed to teaching a man to fish and I was I was with a CEO of a company that I worked for back in the day and I was starting to do a little of stuff online this is like year like six or seven years ago and I remember he took me on a walk on the beach at the Monarch in uh or the Montage of the Monarch in um California and he was like the thing is Cody um we get rich quietly here like we don't build the I we build the me all those you know things and at the time I didn't really like that answer and in in my self-righteousness I was like well he doesn't get it and the internet's going to be so powerful and and steak dinners and strippers which is how a lot of people in finance raise money doesn't work and isn't going to work in the future and so we should actually build a media present but I realized quickly like he had built a multi-billion Dollar business it was his I was playing with his chip so he had every right to say hey no not at my dime and so at that point I kind of realized that I think what I actually like doing is I like watching other people grow and build based on the ideas I share with them like my little ego likes when somebody tells me that one of the things that I did works for them and I feel like that's like kind of a cool Legacy um makes me happier and so I started realizing that originally just by speaking with some nonprofits we worked with I would go and speak and I was like a I kind of feel good I feel better doing that than when I close a big transaction actually and so I started doing that more and more and then I was like huh uh I think we should scale this because I just think I have that sickness in my brain that anything I do a little bit I want to do giant probably not that dissimilar with you and basketball you're like I could go play a pickup game or I could invite Mr Beast and also LeBron you're like well let's do option two and so um so I was like I just started writing a newsletter for a while and didn't realize it was a business and then the first thing I did that I would tell anybody to do if you want to go and build a Content machine is you should steal people who have already built the thing it seems so obvious but uh Nobody Does it everybody tries to do things by themselves and because I had built a lot of businesses by now I was like oh this is just a normal business we need ahead of Ops we need ahead of I would have called it marketing back in the day but now we call it ahead of content you know we need a head of Finance to figure out how much we should budget and how much we should put into all of this stuff and then we also uh probably need a bunch of chiefs a bunch of Indians underneath the Chiefs and so I basically hired those first three things I always hire first at the top and then I do a sliding scale down um and after I had hired those three people because I was funding it all myself from what I had built before then I started to go sector or Niche specific so like hire one person for Tik Tok hire one person for Twitter hire one person for Instagram and it doesn't mean that they would write it all in their ghost writing I would just say I'm stressed about these three platforms I'm going to remove my stress from me into you and so you shall now stress all day about Tik Tok and Twitter and Instagram and a newsletter and I will not I'm going to stress on this portfolio businesses which nobody else can run and so that's how I started and do you um do you do one for the other do they feed each other or what's the what's the plan with the content like how does the content fit with the portfolio of businesses what's the what why do you do both why not just do one yeah but it's the best I mean I think maybe you've talked about this but the flywheel of content is the most powerful thing I've ever seen I mean nval talked about it with his he I think he talked about three levels of Leverage which was you know uh Capital I'm sorry people capital and then code and then I think the current one is audience and audience is the only permissionless version all those other ones you have to have Banks you had to have employees say yes you had to actually understand code um but audience is is so your favorite word um democratized anybody can uh put in the swear jar before you leave yeah exactly anybody can can do it and so I was like well this is fascinating um if I could get like for instance yesterday in one of our YouTube videos we put a a lead magnet to the newsletter and we got like 2500 newsletter signups and let's say that a newsletter sign up on average costs us one to two bucks well that was you know that's $5,000 I could have done through PPC or through organic I could just get it from audience content yeah yeah and so um they all influence one another but how I originally thought about it is I'm going to talk about content about buying businesses because I talk about buying businesses what's going to happen a bunch of people are going to want to sell me their business so now I'm going to buy more businesses that they want to sell and I'm going to buy them at better prices and faster than anybody else because they feel like they already know me and they trust me right and so I'm almost indexing on trust I'm going to tell them EX exactly how I value it I'm going to tell them exactly how I buy and then they're going to sell me their business and then once they sell me their business I'm going to build that business through my audience so I'm going to funnel more of the audience into said business and then finally when I go to exit the business I'm going to have a community of buyers that want to buy this business and then I'm going to do it again and again and again and it sort of ended up working out like that I would say most often now it's that I get referrals to businesses that I want to buy I it's not so much cold Outreach um so maybe it was slightly off from what I thought the thesis was going to be right right and okay so I want to give you a chance to address what I view as good criticism so what's good criticism good criticism is uh so bad criticism is this person's full of [ __ ] good criticism is um uh it's it's not all perfect right it's like that that's like a good version of criticism it meaning you're in a good position if somebody says that so for example I want to give you a chance to uh do to answer this in two ways the first is every criticism I believe has a kernel of Truth when I go read the YouTube comments and somebody says uh blah blah blah about me it might be mean it might have been rude might have been uncalled for but it's usually not completely baseless there's some kernel of Truth in it and the same thing on the good side somebody compliments me it's usually not as good as they say but there's a kernel of truth and that's what led to that that sentiment so here's some of the the PE things that people would say about you Cody Sanchez uh her real business is in creating content getting you to pay her to teach you how to buy a business not in the businesses she's bought herself um in what way would that be true and in what way would that be false yeah um I think one I I think you're right one of our mottos is question everything so I don't think there's anything wrong with with questioning any of that um we make more money categorically from the businesses we own than from the community that we own for instance so like numerically categorically that's just the fact now would I be upset if all of a sudden we're doing 25 50100 million in a community and and this my idea of an m&a for MB like an MBA m&a if I could actually create that and I could supplant what we're getting in institutions and education systems i' be [ __ ] thrilled so the second that I make way more money with communities courses I will be shouting it at yes like we built the best [ __ ] thing ever we're doing tens and tens of millions of dollars and you're welcome like happy um the second like what would be true about that is yeah we're really good at this like it is a big business it does millions of dollars a year uh I think we have really quickly supplanted anybody in the industry like we are the name if you want to go learn how to buy a business soon we will be the name if you want to learn how to sell a business and my goal is we will also be in the name if you want to learn how to build a business so we will own the entire ecosystem I'm in talks right now with University of Texas and University of Austin which is Joe lonsdale's uh company to do uh a program with them where we can push back on what I think is awful education that's taught at most institutions right and instead of telling you what to think and a bunch of political nonsense we're just going to teach you really smart Financial tactics that you can apply whichever way you want and so um it does like I'm sure it's the same with you what bothers me when people talk about me online is if I feel like there is a kernel of Truth or we [ __ ] up like one time we did this tweet thread ah and it was a seven instead of a two for the number of years that I was at Goldman which is like you can see it on my uh form you4 and my uh LinkedIn you could see how long I was a Goldman and I had all these people be like I knew you were just a [ __ ] secretary and you were only there for you know two years out seven and that one actually bothered me a little bit because I was like we were wrong and so [ __ ] that's that's that's a typo who cares um you're wrong but like don't beat yourself up over that right like that's nothing yeah um yeah that's true another way to think about or another like I guess thing to to react to um so we get less criticism I I was wondering this I was like why do we get less criticism so I was worried I was like are we just less popular or less good than these other people and what I realize is actually know there's one difference which is when you do a podcast um podcasts because they're long form it sort of naturally filters a bunch of people out second it gives you a chance to breathe and be yourself and people tend to once they get to know you and understand you they tend to not uh not feel the same way about you uh not not have like that sort of reactionary uh takeaway against you uh the third is that you're just not everywhere and the vibe is I'm talking to my buddy Sam you're here listening as a fly on the wall versus you go on Instagram or Tik Tok you're staring down the barrel looking at the camera saying you should do this all of a sudden you're a business guro all of a sudden you're telling me what to do all of a sudden guard the walls go up uh and literally just because of the way you're which way we're pointing when it's me talking to my co-host is very different than somebody who picks up their phone and says uh you know I'm so great and here's what I do and you should do the same so that's what I realized is actually the way that the reaction gets really big now I'm wonder how you think about like distancing yourself or do you just not care about like the whole like business Guru kind of like Grant Cardone Ty Lopez like there's like this whole thing that I personally don't want to necessarily be associated with I don't necessarily think that they're bad in anyway I just don't want to be bucketed in with that group um and I can see how there's like a tension between the more you come out and talk about business and how to make it the more you can be bucketed as business Guru how do you think about that do you do you think you do fall into that trap or how do you avoid that yeah um one I think as I think I'm a big ethical moral compass type person so like if I feel like I'm doing something wrong uh that's going to bother me a lot more than what other people think about me and so that that doesn't bother me too much I also think and I would be curious your take like I want to do a math model on this I so much of what we are told in today's society in my opinion is the opposite it's like it's clown world it's we're told this thing and it actually makes no sense for instance if I went out right now I've never ever raised money for any of the businesses that I invest in from my audience ever not once not once have I asked for a dollar for that now we have a venture fund that's tiny that I say do not invest in if you don't want to lose money because this is like a very small it's a $10 million fund and it's like who knows who knows if Venture Works um and I think that there's a legitimacy that comes with asking people people for money to invest in your funds as opposed to teaching them how to do the thing which in my mind actually makes no sense because if I went to raised another billion dollar fund family like I did I'm going to make so much more money than I ever will teaching people how to do things online so much more money but then they don't actually learn so I think I have like a I have like a chip on my shoulder about it that I want to push back on it and I also think man young Cody would have really liked to learn this earlier and wouldn't it be nice if somebody would have actually showed me their homework back in the day like I would have liked that actually um so I think I think that's how I I remedied it now I hate comparisons to Grant Cardone or Tai Lopez because uh I'm not talking about those two because I don't know them individually but you know I looked at some of the fundraising docs on Grant Cardone stuff and I don't think it's that great for retail investors I think it's pretty one-sided and I think Ty Lopez is very like like Ferraris women you know get rich quick stuff and ours is sort of the opposite it's like this is going to be hard it'll take longer than you think it'll be harder than you think and maybe it'll be worth it if you actually keep going past the point in which it's comfortable um but yeah I think at some point you just have to give up what people think about you on the internet one way or the other because there's always going to be you know if you think about it also Sean like so if we have 100 million views a month or 5 million followers like 1% is going to be [ __ ] nuts for sure just like categorically and so anytime something happens I go well that's the 1% unless we're doing something wrong and then I go well we we did that was a typo that's our bad right well I'm hoping that people who listen to this uh you know I I guess like I believe that like you just said you the mo you know the most important opinion is the one you have of yourself you know the reputation with yourself is the one that matters uh I also believe that people should come to their own opinions once they have the opportunity to hear you speak which is why I asked some of these questions to you because I wanted to I wanted to know that I wanted to hear how you would answer them myself but I also know that for most people they're not really going to get to hear you talk on this um really anywhere so uh as far as as far as I've seen so I hope that people you know come to whatever opinions they want on that stuff uh that's that's on them at that point I think that the ideas you shared at the beginning and the model that you've created here around buying boring businesses is fascinating to me um I am almost jealous that I don't want to buy a boring business I'm like oh well that you know like what what's wrong with the chip in my brain that wants to buy exciting businesses like I only want to buy exciting businesses and I think that is probably harder higher degree of difficulty um yeah but you know you you you choose you get to choose the game you play that's that's the game I want to play um or you just invest in you invest in Xavier's thing which we both did too you know and you support small businesses is that way I mean and the only other thing I want to say is like I think it's really cool what you guys are doing here because although you might not call your businesses boring you are actually doing the thing that most people in Industry hate which is you're taking complex ideas and you're skinning them down so a lot of people can execute on them and like there not a lot of people want to share their homework like that so while mine might be boring and yours might be more sexy I think we're both doing something really similar which is here's what worked for me here's some relatively complex stuff here's how I think we could really simplify it and then like you go do and go build something cuz I think that's the only thing that makes the world a little bit better are the builders my uh I invested in the same company you did shop Genie which is like the perfect example of a boring business that can be pretty big and so these guys make like if you go to an auto repair shop uh if I if you need to go get your car repaired today you basically have to drive it's only like Walkin essentially you drive in or you call nobody picks up the phone you drive up and then they're like H it's going to be a couple hours you can just like leave it here and like go home on foot and and you're like ah [ __ ] like damn I wish this was like I wish this worked like everything else in the world worked meaning I wish go online and book an appointment and show up and drop off my car and be done and pay you online not like you know not like you know in cash here or whatever and so they made this like basically like a booking software for auto repair shops is that a good way to explain it that's how I think about it at least yeah well and now that you're talking about it I'm sure this will happen for them again but what's cool about when we get to invest in these types of businesses like we did a little tweet for them and a little announcement of investing in them and they got like 30 franchise users who have multiple franchises underneath them right and so the ability to help somebody scale with a podcast like yours is really cool which makes sense because you did support Shephard and I think that's like a similar similar model yeah it's so Kieran the founder of it uh he told me about this business I was like that's a great idea I would NE like I don't want to do that that sounds boring to me but it's not boring to you and that's all that matters and investing is the easiest way for me to like ride along that ride and the funny thing is told me like back to the content idea he's like oh we have this guy um I never heard of this guy Aaron Stokes do you know who this is he's he's like you know the the whoever you know the the Gary ve of the auto repair world and so this one guy I'm pretty sure this guy is making like $30 million a year just creating content for people that own auto repair businesses um and he's like he has just conquered this Niche and um he's the he's doing the content marketing stuff but only for a really really narrow thing but then for them he's probably the only talented content person that's creating anything for them and so when he hosts the event or he has the the paid group or whatever I don't even know this guy's full business model but I know that his revenue is up there sort of like 20 million plus um and he can get a thousand you know auto repair shop owners to show up to to any event that he you know a conference that he throws and I was like wow this content game can be like niched down into the into the even the boring verticals in a very interesting way yeah we should own more of those huh I mean like I think a fun game like a great content Channel that I was talking to Chris my husband about was like oh what did he call it he called it like cringe con and it would just be like you going to different Niche industry conferences and watching their Keynotes like the keynote from the Self Storage industry conference and like the keynote from you know CU one of our our friends uh owns a small self storage company that we're going to invest in and uh he was like yeah I went to a self storage uh conference and the keynote speaker was like they use words like hoarders we use words like customers you know and you're like I just want to see this so there's so many ways giant compilation of of every like Niche conference be hilarious yeah I know I'm going to speak at ballies Conference next week about like they use all these words Shan that you probably know because you're smarter than me like ACC SL in parenthesis on your Twitter bio dude I don't know what the hell that is I've seen that everywhere yeah that's what I told him I'm like I need a I need a dictionary to speak here and uh and what I thought was fascinating is I'm like you have this whole world that nobody else knows about and you know you guys have all made billions or hundreds of millions off of it so so many ways to make money and that to me would actually be boring like I don't you know acronyms I don't need all of those yeah I've told the story before but we got the idea from milk Road uh to not the idea but the like trigger to launch milroad was at uh Farm con we went to a farming conference in Kansas City and like same thing you know we get we go in and the the panel is talking about you know corn and wheat Futures and I'm like if I was stunned I was like these guys know what Futures are and secondly like we're talking about corn Futures and then one guy was like I'm all in on beans and I was like hey man brother I'm all in on beans too but I think for different reasons so like it was such a wild experience that I just really had no like it was a totally different world like you know literally like 2,000 farmers in a room just talking farming and um you know I think it's really good to get outside your bubble and kind of like you for a guy from who lives in San Francisco talks to Tech dorks all day like that was a totally different experience I should do more of that but like that was my one kind of like my one trip last year it's like I don't go to burning man I went to farm con that which I think is a actually more extreme experience all things considered dude that's going to be mean next week I already told bology I'm like I'm pretty sure I'm going to understand half of this he had this idea too that I was like I think actually this is a terrible idea at categorically he like wanted to do five minute speeches like five minute little speeches I'm like one that's hard like I'll you know okay we can do that and he's like so I want to do a bunch of them and I was thinking in order for some of them to be really fast what we'll do is we'll we can pre-record some of it so it's really good and then we'll walk up on the stage and we could press play and I was like like a DJ I was like B you are the smartest man I've ever met and also no he's like and then instead of coming to the conference everyone just stays home and actually they just listen to it on their own in the podcast app it's a podcast actually this is yeah I mean thank God humans think differently but I'm I'm really curious to imagine if I could carry a conversation well with a lot of people here I'm just going to tell them the thing is if you want to know about laer mats I'm your girl that's about it and they're like we don't we don't that's that next all right uh Cody this has been great sorry I took you so far over time but not at all a blast thank you for guest hosting uh while Sam is out and uh that's the Pod where oh where should people follow you where do where do you want where do you want to send them Cody Sanchez on all the socials uh pretty straightforward all right that's [Music] it

I look at this category and how much money is in this category and um it's going to happen it's just there's never been a business there's never been a carcass so tempting so bloated swimming so [Music] slowly all right we just asked Scott Galloway if he was 25 years old again what businesses would he start cuz this guy started I think nine businesses sold won for over $100 million and we said if you were 25 what would you do what are the ideas the opportunities the trends that you would take advantage of and he gave us two answers he said if you had no degree no college degree no fancy education he would do this and he said if I had a fancy degree instead I would do this other thing very cool to hear kind of where his head's at the small opportunities and the big one what he called the the multi- trillion dollar carcass that he can't believe nobody has uh has disrupted yet and on top of that we asked about his finances we talked about when he sold his companies and made his first few million bucks and then tens of millions of dollars all the way up to how he got over $100 million how he lost it along the way and what were the key moments that allowed him to to reach those Heights with his with his own finances you know I've seen probably 100 interviews with Scott Galloway and I'd never heard him reveal these numbers or talk about this so openly in fact at one point he goes I'm naked here I'm naked here guys you got to tell me something and so uh very very good interview with Scott Galloway enjoy welcome to the Pod uh I've been uh I've been listening to you for a very long time I was a fan of yours starting I think with L2 with the No Mercy No Malice videos and the reason I've liked you is I find myself you might be 15 or 20 years older than me but I find myself looking up to you because I think we have a lot of very similar characteristics which are a rotile disfunction not yet anger depression um I have hair but you're pretty buff you might be buffer than me I I admire you for that thanks for that uh like you like to post shirtless pics I like you for that I do but you're very hard to Peg down politically you're you're you're you're kind of like all over the map when it comes to that you also you you have beautiful language I'm a big fan of beautiful language you've got beautiful language you're better than I am but I look so I look up to you for that and you started a bunch of really amazing businesses but you're kind of known like I've told we did this episode where we talked about personal finances where you talked about spending 2 to 400,000 a month and people were like I you know Scott was so rich and I was like no he he created a bunch of really big companies but you're more famous for being like Scott Galloway the brand and I think that that's pretty cool and so you've done a bunch of really interesting stuff this is the whole episode by the way it's just Sam complimenting you it's like a reverse roast actually so you just sit there and you just get compliments at the end of the hour you know you feel good that that that's what happens here yeah so far I just let me say I'm really enjoying this it's like a verbal massage this is this works for me uh anyways go on keep going s well like I read these sentences and I'm like that's a beautiful line I love that [ __ ] I just love how he's coming up with that stuff um but yeah I mean I think it's like I think it's really good and what's crazy is you've had a better career as a as a business person and I was said the key to my success is is rejection and that is I've had a lot of the marketplace businesses Capital providers women uh have provided a great deal of rejection for me and my skill is my ability to endure that and move on and not let lose my sense of enthusiasm you know the ability to mourn and move on is key and the wonderful thing about America is that we don't Embrace failure that's [ __ ] but we tolerate it and I know so many really successful people who are very successful and then they do something on their own or they do something and it doesn't work for them and they get stuck they just lose their Mojo and they can't get past it they can't handle the bullet to the to the chest or the Bullet to the arm becomes an opportunistic infection that starts damaging everything about them and I've that's my only skill I'm OB you know I'm really into my dogs I started an e-commerce company I want to be the williamsa pet supplies I put a million bucks of my own money in I sold it for like a million and a half so I made some money not a lot um I invested or I started another e-commerce company I started a travel site sold that for a little bit of money um you know I've had a lot of kind of and then I've had things where I you know I ran into a you know drove into a wall at 200 miles per hour I started coming a red envelope which went public on the NASDAQ in 2002 and because I was young and dumb I kept investing and then I got in a war with the board and I did a proxy fight and I took over the board and put more of my money in and then 2008 came came and there's a long shoran strike and a software malfunction at the warehouse where we sent 10,000 gifts to the wrong addresses over the holidays and then a Wells Fargo analyst who was like 14 decided the credit crisis was coming and pulled our line and my stock went from seven bucks a share to zero in about 11 days and when the company had declared chapter 11 and I lost you know I lost pretty much everything do you remember how much money uh when you felt that Tipping Point where you did feel financially secure not like bulletproof where nothing will ever will happen but do you remember the inflection point where you're like okay this feels different than I've felt on on the climb I still don't I still haven't hit that point I'm still very anxious about money you know I had and I like to be very open about money because I think that not talking about money is basically a decorum that is promoted by the incumbents and the wealthy such that you don't understand how much money wealthy people have to keep poor and middle class people under the illusion that oh you you should be paying 45% taxes while I'm paying 17 and I think I think it's important to be very I think it's helpful to be transparent and I talk about how much money I've lost all my investments how much money I've gained my tax rates Etc but the the you know I'm I'm still I'm not obsessed with money I think about it all the time I'm trying to get a lot more I'm I'm giving it away I five from five years ago I decided I was going to give away every dollar I made in current income um because I want to start catching up to the non- philanthropic Scott for the first 45 years of his life but I'm still trying to make a [ __ ] ton of money I still feel financially very insecure I still worry about a recession becoming a depression and I'm the guy who lost it again I've lost it all a couple times and so I don't feel I'm at that point where I don't have Financial anxiety I do sleep with one eye open the big you know I sold my first company company for 28 million bucks by the time I split it with my ex and my partner in taxes I ended up with a few million dollars Red Envelope I got a few million there but I always seem to figure out a way to lose it but I was able to start again because I never had debt I've always lived below my means um uh but I would say the big win was probably selling L2 and I like that oh wow I can buy a plane like that was not in my reach before um so that was kind of the big one that was like all the moons line what was the price what did it sell for $200 or $300 million no it sold for $1 158 million but we'd only done one round of venture capital so the you know the common shareholders you know I was the largest Equity owner um so the top you know between me and the top six employees we probably own 70% of it um so that was that you know that was a lot of money for me I'd never had that kind of money before I'd always done well well but I'd never had that kind of that kind of capital and then getting to invest that in the midst of a bull market we sold in 2017 um you know i' I've made more money investing actually than I've made from my small from my businesses and I'm I got a book coming out of March about uh Financial um trying to develop Financial Security and you know the ability to create a army of capital even if it's only 50 bucks a month or 100 bucks a month put it in a tax deferred or tax efficient vehicle ver ify it and then let time take over against see above you don't know how fast time is going to go that's where I've built real wealth our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better this doesn't this doesn't make sense for Shawn because Shawn is not worried about money at all he's got this thing that I like to call like good emotional health he's very emotionally healthy his his parents did did him well and he's talked to me about this I sold my company two or three years ago and I made a fair bit not I'm I'm like I'm naked here what did you me yeah let's go let's go Sam you got to say he's hesitant he's hesitant because he's worried people listen okay go ahead uh at the end of the the process uh I walked away with about $20 million that and how old are you uh I was about 30 I was 31 or 32 so you should be extraordinary you should be unless you really screw up you should be much wealthier than I am by my age because to get that yeah but I still I still feel shitty I feel the same like I still like I felt awesome for a minute and then I felt shitty where I was like oh like when I see these world events right now when I saw like whatever happens every 6 months I'm like the world's going to end and and I do uh like an I'm boring Sean makes fun of me I do 8020 index and bonds that's the I only own exactly what you should be doing right now I think so and I and then I own Hub fot stock still and then I own Airbnb stock that's basically basically my portfolio and um Sean makes fun of me he's like how are you feeling insecure I'm like dude I'm broken like I'm broken like I it doesn't matter how much therapy I go to I'm just I'm a broke when it comes to money I have a scarcity mindset and I'm broken yeah I'm the same way and when you talk about how you're worth you know 100 million plus and you don't feel feel secure and Sean said he's like what a little [ __ ] like you know like you talk about masculinity man up you know what I mean like it's and I have the same thing I'm like I I can't so I'll give you I'm weak by but the only thing I would say is just uh I both of you guys obviously super smart guys and you know it's sort of irrational that you're feeling that way and I guess the question I would have Scott is like uh like you know you actually are financially secure now right like it would take um it would take a lot for you to get to the point where you're not able to fund your lifestyle or provide for your family or whatever at this at this point um so you know that that anxiety is is somewhat irrational and you're a very smart guy and you've clearly like done the self-development work in a bunch of other areas of your life I'm just surprised that I like I can't tell is it just one of these like virtue signal things where you're like hey guys I'm just I'm still like you I'm still I still sweat it and I'm like oh is that what these guys are doing they're just trying to relate to the common man um or are you actually just not like fixing that irrational part of your brain and just being like uh you know you know working on that like getting it getting it right um which one is it yeah so first off the Neurosis is real it's not a it's not a humble brag it's part of a brag but it's not a humble BR it's the Neurosis is real but it's also it's also a feature as well as a bug because I'm all over the people managing my money I know where my money is I think a lot about diversifying Sam what you're doing is exactly what you should be doing cuz you're not looking to get you're looking to get richer but more than anything you're looking to not get poor and the mistake I made at your age when I had some wins was I would double down and I would start another company and put all my money into one thing like you're quite frankly you should be selling down your Airbnb and your HubSpot stock and just letting you don't need the needle in a Hy stack you just need to buy the whole Hy stack cuz got enough capital I have a price Target like I I I have like a number where I'm like when we get to around this we're going to we'll get out of those yeah but I would do do I mean a longer conversation but Sean tier I think about financial insecurity a lot it is still very possible you know there's been periods in economic history where if you're invested and you know you can lose most or all of it um I've put a little bit of pressure on myself because and this is virtue signaling I give a lot of money away so but yeah I don't and also I have a really nice lifestyle but no the insecurity is still there I I I was always financially insecure growing up and I just don't know if that goes away but I I think some of it is a good thing I have my eye on stuff I think about it a lot and it's like if you want to be good at money if you want to be good at anything if you want to be good at tennis if you want to be good at Stam collecting you need to think about about it a lot it doesn't you know Roger Federer thinks about tennis a lot a lot and if you want to be good at money uh I think you have to have a certain amount of financial literacy you have to understand interest rates you have to be thinking wait when my mortgage rolls in 14 months is it going to go from 2 and a qu% to 7% oh wait it is does that mean I should be thinking about selling it paying off my mortgage you just if you want to be wealthy unless you're extraordinarily talented at something I mean extraordinarily talented and also can live below your means and most extraordinarily talented people have a tough time living below their means it's not how much you make it's how much you know you spend in your ability to create a Delta so you always save below live below your means yeah the the insecurity is real it really I still am very fearful of being broke I don't I don't want to go back there and not only that I'm getting to an agro I I don't have that much time to make it back so no the insecurity the insecurity is real what helps is is that you have cash flow now like a lot of startup people you're poor you're poor you're poor and then you're poor for seven years then you maybe hopefully have an exit then you get a windfall and then it feels good for a little while and then you're like but there's there's no more income um what changed for me because this podcast and Sean this podcast has done well is and and a few other things that we have got going on in our life we actually have regular great cash flow you have the same that has made me feel better is like getting checks every month and like seeing the balance go up on a consistent basis the cash flow like there's a difference between entrepreneurs I found between who sell and just make windfalls versus who have a business that they fully own and they're able to take out income every quarter or every year um and having that cash flow definitely makes me feel better oh no doubt you always want to be making money and also it keeps you in shape being subject to trying to make as much money as spend or ideally more at any age keeps you in the market you have to you have to understand what the market values and doesn't value it keeps you it's how I I think it keeps me that an exercise keeps me is is hopefully going to keep me sort of young and that is understanding how how to how to create something in the marketplace whether it's a podcast or a book or a talk for me that people are willing to pay for Keeps Me In the game it keeps keeps me in the ring it keeps me in shape uh so I think it's really important to and also you're right it does if you let the end of the year no okay if my even if my investments are down 20 or 30% which they were last year I'm still making you know almost as much or more than I spend that's that you do get huge comfort and peace from that you know one of the things we like to do on this podcast is um that's different than most is that we we ask every guest who comes on about what they're seeing now so like so far we talked about the past and most podcasts are just about your past how you how'd you do it but um we like to talk about Trends opportunities B what what business would you be starting or do you see as something people could start now right like if you go on if you go on hot ones you eat hot wings if you come on MFM you talk about ideas and opportunities that's sort of the stick um in fact we almost canceled this podcast because we didn't know if you were prepped and ready with that but Sam said no no no he's going to be he's good he's good off the cuff you'll be ready um what opportunities or ideas do you see today that either you know you're tempted to do or you say no I'm out of the game but if I was 25 again this is what I would be running at this is what I would be working on um this is a problem that I think somebody could go solve what do you see out there today so first off a lot of it is situational right someone coming out of someone with a degree from an elite University who has the ability whose parents will support them and doesn't have a high burn or maybe a partner that works you know it's just a lot of it situational I I don't like it I've never like this hustle culture where people say go offer to carry Jeff bezos's bags or have coffee because some if you're a single mother that's just not an option for you so some of it's situational so I'll go through a few situations if I'm a young man or woman and I haven't had the opportunity to get credentialed I don't have a traditional four-year college degree much less a college degree from Elite institution I think there going to be a lot of businesses whether it's carpet cleaning or gas stations or uh you know hanging and selling draperies into small Furniture companies that are owned by Boomers they're going to need uh transition nice small businesses and these individuals will need liquidity events and they're just aging out of the business they don't you know they're hitting their 60s and 70s and they don't want to be calling on car washes to sell in you know their product or whatever it is and these are businesses doing between half a million and 10 million a year that have no succession strategy because if they made money their kids don't want to be in this type of business because their kid went to Emy and wants to go to work at Google and I would try and find be really Scrappy about getting into a business understanding it trying to find people who own it and figure out a way to buy it using that person's Capital approach somebody and say I want to take over your business I'm going to buy it slowly over 5 years and then I'm going to give you coupons so you can retire um if I'm a credentialed person if I have a degree unfortunate enough I would go to work for a big platform I think we live in an era of of where antitrust is no longer in effect so the big companies if you were to divide the stock market into desiles the 10 the companies with the largest market cap over the last 30 years have outperform the bottom nine by huge Factor so going to work for a big company is vastly underrated they can abuse their Monopoly position they will have that mole removed you will get rich slowly working at Google or at McKenzie so if you're credentialed uh you know we over romanticize entrepreneurship if you have the ability to get into the greatest wealth creating vehicle in history and that is a US Corporation do it but they have security at the front saying do you have a degree from an elite college but if you do absolutely go to work for a big multinational conglomerate if you're an entrepreneur I think that the and credentialed and can raise money I would say that the intersection between Ai and healthare the most disruptable business in the world is US Healthcare three and a half to4 trillion dollar four out of Fe five people aren't happy with it it's cost of outpaced inflation for the last 40 years meaning it's got the biggest chin in the world and I think the fists of stone coming for it are uh is artificial intelligence where we can take Healthcare from a defensive based industry to offensive I give my grocery receipts my workout routine My Health Care records my sleep patterns to a company that figures it all out and then gives me prescripted goes on offense proactive lifestyle Grocery and exercise recommendations and I think there's just going to be a ton of Niche businesses and health care that leverage some form of AI are there any out there that you like yeah uh I'm an investor in a company called 98.6 that does text-based health care it's a private company so we sell into B2B a big you know Sam's and Sam's offers for $3 a month to every employee or we charge them three bucks a month an ability to text somebody in an AI says okay it's it's a it's a rash we're getting a dermatologist on the line they look at the rash using your smartphone and say this is fine I'm sending you a cream and hit and or this needs a prescription we're hitting the pharmacy and by the way that that investment I've written down by 80% it's been really hard I've I've lost money so far in that so I don't want to pretend that this is all easy but I would say if I were young and had intellectual capital and credentialing I would go into something around Ai and healthc care and then man well like that shocks me that you said that say that because when I look at I've done a few Healthcare things and I look at like the landscape it seems like impossible to like it just see there seems like there's a [ __ ] ton of Regulation figuring out insurance companies seems like the hardest thing there is um and even though everyone is frustrated about their setup this seems like a like a very challenging space to crack into and of course there's there's huge rewards if you can pull it off but it seems very very challenging I I just look at this I look at this category and how much money is in this category and um it's going to happen it's just there's never been a business there's never been a carcass so tempting so bloated swimming so slowly as us-based Healthcare we spend $113,000 per person but we die earlier and we're obese and we're more depressed the UK spends six and a half thou how can the UK in Australia be living longer and spending half what we in the US spend on health care that's just the mother of all chins there's going to be disruption there and I'd want to get in the way of that the other thing I'm really excited about and I think is the most underhyped I just did a blog post on this I think gp1 is bigger than gp4 what's gp1 OIC woia oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah which I i' I've tested semi glte a ton it's amazing um like I think there's like so many crazy implications on what it could do like I think I think it could i' I've been saying this I don't know [ __ ] by the way other than I tested it and I had drinking problems in the past I think it could like help solve alcoholism I think there's so many crazy things there was this guy on Twitter uh our buddy from CB insights was like what did he say did he say that um uh food companies are going to lose money cuz people are eating less and he said airline companies are going to make more money cuz people weigh less he's like that's how big of a deal these drugs are if I was starting a hedge Fone right now I would have a fund that did nothing but go short food stocks McDonald's nobody walks into Arby's and looks around and thinks this was a good decision no one ever thinks that and if if all of a sudden I could get an ejection or take a pill every week that help me make better decisions our instincts have not cut up to the institutional production of our economy we drink too much we eat any anytime we're near Salt Fat or sugar we Gorge because for 99 again 99% of our species history we couldn't find these things when mating the majority of men have had almost no mating opportunities through history a small minority of men have had all the meeting opportunities and then you're presented with a reasonable fact simile of sex called porn and there's a there's a decent segment of men out there who aren't working aren't getting out of the house because they're staying home and watching too much porn and they're also not engaging in relationships we drink too much I'm addicted to other people's affirmation my kid is on Snap too much this could be scaffolding I mean the weight loss thing is arguably the biggest addressable Market in the world 40% of America is obese 70% is obese and overweight but even bigger than that this could be the scaffolding on our instincts to update our instincts to where they need to be with in the industrial production that has gone exponential in the last 100 150 years with assembly line technology the microprocessor and say okay Scott you like THC too much you like alcohol way too much you're too desperate for other people's affirmation and what people say about you on Twitter bums you out way too much much we're going to calibrate these glp1 drugs to help you moderate your Cravings I mean what these things do is they moderate your cravings when your Cravings are getting the incorrect signals from 300,000 years of instinct on on the Savannah and everybody I mean they're finding out they're finding out people on OIC drink 60% less alcohol they're biting their nails less so the opportunity to update our instincts for the entire I mean the market I I'm just I'm blown away by this thing I think it could be just enormous and there isn't anybody that doesn't have that has instincts that has a behavioral model that is that is driven by Instinct that is caught up to our world I don't care who you are have you tried it I haven't but as you can tell I'm ready yeah jeez I feel like you just injected me digitally just now with it that was amazing you know how much it costs a month about 1,000 bucks a month right it's between $500 and $1,000 a month when I was trying it it was 500 a month out of pocket most insurance companies and and I think if you have diabetes they actually only cover it I think for a limited time but most people using it now are are just paying $500 to $1,000 a month and here's the crazy [ __ ] about this drug you have to increase your dosage every every week so you start with a very small amount and every two weeks or so you have to increase it like forever well I I don't know forever but over a course of at least a year you have to so the like when I first started taking it I would I would test out just a little bit and it would make me a little bit sick to my stomach you know the the downside of there's a few downsides one is upset stomach and then after about 3 weeks I'm like all right I feel great let's let's increase it and then now at the end of uh 6 months you're taking 10 times you basically on a syringe you got to fill thing up to 100 at first you fill it up to 10 and over a year you have to increase it and so you have to pay more and more money what could go wrong there's a lot of things that can go wrong with it I like I i' I've tested it one downside is I actually don't know if you develop healthy eating habits you just eat less and you lose muscle you lose muscle uh there are definitely downsides to it it's not a terribly new drug like uh I think that these types of things have been around for like 30 years so there's some studies but like the as it's being prescribed now it's definitely newish so there are definitely going to be downsides but it's super promising another one is uh metformin which isn't in the same um which isn't in the same category entirely but it does similar things that's super interesting I always think it's interesting when people like Sam Alman like these Geniuses who like see everything take it and he's been like this is the drug I take I take met Foreman all the time so that's super fascinating so I agree I think I think these this classification of drugs is is quite interesting I mean I was even thinking I'm trying to figure out the second order of effects here and like does Mna stock go down 80% because the reality is through the pandemic we the farri weaponized and politicized mass and vaccines and decided Well if you take them it means you're far left so if you're far right you don't want to take these things on the far left we weaponized and politicized obesity we didn't want to acknowledge that 88% of mortalities had one comorbidity uh at least that was obesity related and we started with this Trope of oh you're not obese you're finding your tree truth no you're not you're finding diabetes there's nothing to celebrate here and so we decided we didn't want to have an open conversation about the fact that America is obese 40% of a the kids you're more likely to commit suicide obesity and children it's terrible you're much more likely to be depressed as an adult not go to college you become more likely to kill yourself I mean so what happens to misto if all of a sudden we drastically reduce if you drastically reduce obesity in America you drastically reduce the vulnerability of the population to a Corona virus so do you need Mna I mean at at some point the reality is a 25-year-old who's thin yeah you get vaccinated for a variety of reasons but it's not at some point it becomes less obvious whether you need these vaccines when the society is healthy and not obese I I mean I'm just kind of Blown Away Hospital networks entire Hospital networks could go out of business if they're really honest the milin institutes that obesity related costs are $1.7 trillion a year when you look at everything from knee Replacements to cardiac to cancers that are obesity related we're looking at $1.7 trillion a year that's 7% of our economy so what happens when the entire economy gets a cost cut of 7% so I I'd want to get kind of near this techn I think this technology is going to have a bigger impact on the real economy than AI I think AI we've kind of hit Peak AI I love it I use it a lot but it's a little bit overhyped right now we're definitely kind of I would say I think about a month ago we hit Peak AI in terms of from an investor standpoint I would not want to be buying into AI companies right now as an entrepreneur I'd want to be raising money for an AI company but I anyways you asked me what I was excited about trying to find a baby boomer that wants to sell a small business and do seller financing uh if you're have certification you're fortunate enough for whatever reason you either have Rich parents or you're freakishly remarkable and you ended up at Dartmouth go to work for a big American company we are they're amazing you'll get rich slowly smart people great place to meet mentors great place to meet mates you just just these companies are totally underrated in terms of their power and what they can do for you professionally and economically uh if you're an entrepreneur something around Healthcare and Ai and I think from an investment standpoint uh I just want to be near I'm very excited about glp1 as an emerging technology we need to get you to start taking it so we can well have have you not taking it because you're afraid of the side effects or if you're not taking it because you're like I'm already cut I don't need this oh no I'd like look I think I I don't know this but who who gop1 should be uh who who should could reach right now is poor and middle-income households that are obese that's where the greatest societal benefit would be right now who I think is probably driving the sales are rich people who want to lose the last 10 or 20 pounds that's my gut my gut is that the people taking it right now the Hollywood drugs 100% dude I went to I went to CVS the other day I had to get like the whooping cough vaccine and I went to CVS and I had to wait for an hour to get the vaccine five people were in line I the [ __ ] worst thing about CVS and Walgreens is they say out loud oh are you here to pick up your simala like they say it like really loud like and I'm like the [ __ ] five people had lied and it was all older people who looked like they had diabetes five people they were like oh are you here for the OIC and like they say what the pricing is and they go all right I'll pay it and and and these people it it was like the white New Balance crowd it wasn't like a like you know like it was a Wrangler jeans crowd this wasn't like a like a high they didn't I didn't stereotype these people as like yuppies and they were swiping their card just jump up and yell cyia oh wait you said something else never mind I hate that about the phes where they say I'm like can you can you shut the [ __ ] up Scott this could be your philanthropy thing you should be giving away gop1 to the to the masses that could be your moment that nobody's on that train so I you inspired a thought like when I was 19 I I had terrible I had terrible acne growing up and it was a real source of enormous insecurity for me and I was painfully thin I look like kabad crane with bad skin and it was just really really painful and I was starting to get scars on my face cuz my acne was so bad and I started taking taking acutane and it was about the time I made the crew team at UCLA and I put on a bunch of weight and a bunch of muscle and my skin cleared up and it literally changed my life it just changed my life uh and not only because uh uh you know I was people were more attracted to me and I started having sex which was a wonderful thing in my life but I just felt so much better about myself and still to this day and it's probably inappropriate I was at a gas station and the gas attendant had just terrible acne and I'm like take this as you want I don't mean to offend you but if you heard you know there's there's there there's great drugs uh for this so I'm out there basically trying to prescribe as not as an unlicensed doctor um I don't know what made me think of that but uh this drug that drug literally I I found the guy who invented it this guy who sold the patent to Hoffman L Ro and I tried to write him a letter and they're like well he's dead but we appreciate the letter um anyways anyways but no I haven't taken it I haven't taken it I do take I do take creatine uh I struggle with and no one's going to feel bad about this I struggle with keeping weight on creatine's all the now you said uh uh I've made a bunch of money and I just don't feel good and uh God it's hard for me to to put weight on I just keep losing it so you're two for two on uh unlikable Cry Me a River boss cry me a river yeah I'm too rich and too thin oh yeah Professor punchable we got Professor punch ha that guy I hate that guy well you you do get a lot of punches there's the the what's it called the inverse um the inverse index Gallow index what do you think about that that's pretty good I like that yeah and the craziest call was the Macy's the Macy's call that was a I want to apologize in advance but I'm going to sound defensive the Macy's call was I said that multi- channel I said that about 10 years ago in Germany at a talk and I said that multi- channel retail was the future of marketing and that Macy's who had a great website and stores I said that was the future and in the same talk I said I believe Amazon Will Buy stores and I said I think Amazon will buy Whole Foods but my detractors don't take that clip they take the clip when I said the future looks more like Macy's the anti- Gallow ETF or index it's a bit cherry-picked because I know my picks and they've actually done pretty well but um the reality is the G the the index says since October 4th 2019 tech companies that the professor has predicted would fail have outperformed the S&P and seen a whopping 61% return even excluding Tesla when was that published I don't know because I I think I well one I picked I picked some companies that would lose that skyrocketed specifically Tesla um but I think someone who tracks it as of last year the end of last year because a lot of those stocks got hammered it was it was it was up again but I want to be clear I get I get it wrong all the time and someone who makes predictions like me should be held accountable what I find though is that the in people stop tracking the index when it's there's no longer a story there when I I mean this is what I found um when I talk about when I say that I think that Tesla is overvalued by the way you're right last updated uh on one of these the inverse Gallow index.com last updated 228 2022 which no one's interested because the narrativ when the market started to turn yeah because quite frankly the index is probably overperforming right now and no one's interested in that because the people who invented the index what I find generally especially on Twitter is when I am disparaging about a company or cryptocurrency the people who are along that start engaging in not only professional ass uh assassination but character assassination whenever someone really comes after me I'm like they must be an investor and one of the companies I have been critical of I would say don't never get in between a venture capitalist and their second million because they will take to Twitter and call you a plagiarist or accuse you of having done terrible things at NYU which you've never ever been accused of much less people have people have found you guilty of what what did they accuse you of I'm not even going to go there I've been accused of everything like Behavior stuff or just getting uh picks wrong oh I know it gets really ugly and then you click on the Twitter account it's a picture of a dog and there's no it's an anonymous account I think that there are Venture capitalists who you know fairly well who when I'm when I'm saying this company this cryptocurrency this coin the underlying technology there is no underlying technology and they are funding it with their brand name such that they can dump it because they don't have to disclose their sales and they hire a PR agency that creates 10,000 Bots and then creates a list of people who don't think Crocket is going to replace the dollar here I've got a good shirt that you can where for for when you're having those conversations for virgins no I would say yeah no it's for people yeah that's right it it means you never kissed a girl um anyways but what I have found is and I wasn't used to getting attack like that and every time I tried to you know I I hired a firm to unmask some of the people who were attacking me it was clearly like the same language I'm like they're using fake accounts and it was almost always someone who had a large financial position in the company that I said was overvalued but look at the end of the day I should be held accountable and when I get it wrong you know I'll have several million people on Twitter point it out um but as somebody who is very close to his own stock picks you things have kind of worked out over here wait wait you hired a firm to figure out who's behind these Twitter accounts I think it's so I I think it's political I've been very critical of Putin and I'm fairly and I know this sounds paranoid but it doesn't mean I'm wrong if I if I were Putin I would hire I would spend a small amount of money I'm spending hundred billion dollar a year in Ukraine and 100,000 Lives why wouldn't I take 5% of that or5 billion dollar and take some very bright scientists and uh do AI generated AB testing and create a list of my five seven 10,000 biggest detractors who are pro Ukraine and start slowly but surely undermining their Authority on social media platforms that have AAL aoral management team who will cash my checks and slowly but surely start undermining their Authority that's what I would do do you have any proof that anything like that has happened or is this just going to my comments go go any I don't know you that's that in itself is not pro it could just be someone time anytime you say any you'll do it go on and talk about Ukraine and you're going to start to see a lot of people attacking you personally and professionally who are anonymous and you could say wow it's just amazing that all of these Anonymous Bots seem to have decided to engage in character assassination because I consistently Am pro Ukraine and wouldn't they be stupid not to do it because people don't look click on the profile they just see the comment and it's always the same language Professor Galloway I don't know it's like what what's the threshold of your I in my eyes you're a big deal but what the threshold of you're a big deal to decision makers who decide these things but it's all about public opinion you can't win a war without public support you can't lose one with public support so the Putin the fastest Blue Line path to victory in Ukraine for Putin is the election of Donald Trump in my view and also uh trying to diminish or reduce public support for the war there so wouldn't they be stupid to not have the gru identify the 10,000 most critical PE or biggest supporters of UK Ukraine and slowly but surely undermine their credibility that's what I why would they'd be stupid not to do that especially on platforms that will cash anybody's checks and as it relates to the fog of misinformation are [ __ ] smoke machines why on Earth would they not do that no I mean I I think they should I I was just I'm giving you a hard time of like are you are you a big enough fish which that that's what that's what I'm trying to figure out oh I might be 20,000 out of a list of 20,000 people but I think I've made the list when it's actually the like Forbes 30 under 30 [ __ ] Putin's 10,000 under 10,000 that's the list that's the real list of influence right there if you go on Face the Nation and say this is the best investment in the history of the West unifying for the first time Europe is a union we've taken NATO out of the brain coma we pushed back on a murderous fascist 90 years ago this is a wonderful moment for the West it's 10% of our military but this is the best investment we ever made I think that qualifies me to get on the list that's what um well are are you enjoying being Scott Galloway the brand more than being Scott Galloway the founder of like an are you enjoying it more than being an operator of companies or are you enjoying uh I mean you have some cool blog posts where you're like when people say hi to me in the streets I love it it makes me feel great which one are you enjoying more Scott Galloway the brand or Scott Galloway the business person oh on the whole this is really wonderful I mean people come up to me and are super nice and you know I'm at that I have 13 and 16y old boys so everything I do is just like tragically uncool in their eyes they don't really seem to like me a great deal so when someone comes up to me it happened yesterday and like wants a picture with me and they're excited to meet me in front of my boys to be honest it just feels really nice and people generally speaking are just so nice and they come up and I get to meet new people yeah it's awesome and it feels very gratifying I'm also we talked about a addictions I'm addicted to affirmation from strangers it's sort of pathetic but I at least know it so I can modulate it and it's really wonderful people are really friendly and really nice you know I went to the Arsenal game with my boys and a bunch of people came up to me and said hi and I was at the Taylor Swift conference uh concert and the 16-year-old girl had made me a bracelet and came up and gave me a bra I mean it's just like I have all these wonderful moments with strangers so it's wonderful I do think there is an algorith for happiness though a pretty good one and that is to be rich but Anonymous cuz at some point I'm going to become the villain and some of the things you talked about before there's an entire industry in America around building people up and then tearing them down and so I wonder when my story turns to the villain because you know at some point I'll probably [ __ ] up and say something really stupid and then Wham people will weigh in but for the time being oh it's wonderful people are nice I just it's so rewarding really rewarding we're um we're coming up on the on our time but I I had one one last question I saw you talk uh I've seen you talk a few times and I've watched your stuff on YouTube the difference between your talks and most everyone's talks is you kind of break a bunch of the rules so you have like 150 slides uh each slide has lots of information on it and you talk super fast you've got a really beautiful Rhythm that it's I say fast but fast in a good way what is the process of like coming up with one these talks because your talks seem way more lucrative like one of your talks would be like maybe a big blog post that I wrote or that I would write and I imagine having like a talk is significantly more lucrative and probably way more fun you could travel all all over the world and and deliver them what's uh what's that process of like do you start with a headline and you're like let me go find data you find a data point and you're like I'm going to build something around this yeah so speaking is the most lucrative business I've ever been and I had 340 inbound requests for speaking speaking I accepted 30 of them I average $112,000 per speaking engagement and my attitude is someone's going to pay me $112,000 I can't just show up and be charming and interesting and like be me on stage I've got to bring something really unique and so I will spend the better part of three months with a team of analysts at prop G trying to come up with themes and data and slides and humor and video clips and then choreograph it and practice it over and over and then test it and try and make it something where you go okay when I mean just like a comedian well humor is a great way to lower people's defenses such that they'll be open to new ideas and so when I say things that are provocative or I'm asking them to think something different humor is a fantastic way to soften the beach for new ideas but you're testing your like you know before you get the Netflix show you're like testing it on the on the on the small um yeah but if I'm a if I'm a MasterCard and they're spending me 100 you know they're spending 150,000 bucks to have me speak for an hour in Barcelona which I did last week you can't just show up and be Scott Galloway I've got to be a guy who rep who gets finds these incredibly smart people to pull data together and that do a great job in my design team and you know greatness is in the agency of others so but it's a ton of fun I get to go to interesting places I get to pick the most interesting cool ones and it's a nice and I have an impact I talk a lot about struggling young men which is really something I'm passionate about and is really rewarding I feel like I'm having a difference I get to go to cool places so I kind of feel like it's my Victory lap right now I get to just sort of run around and you know but I'm but if someone's going to pay that kind of money you just can't show up and just start talking and you know a bunch of War stories about how awesome you are you got to show up with real insight or something that's going to catalyze a conversation with data they haven't seen before back to the drawing board for me then I thought that's uh I thought what I was doing is uh showing up and giving myself a Victory lap dude have you seen one of his talks like every slide has like a data point that is quite good and a story behind it and I'm like dude just finding this data is is a job you're you're an excellent performer uhal speaker and like Sam said you're very lyrical we we enjoy uh we enjoy what you do I think you're you're really great at what you do I don't know how you were as an entrepreneur but like I I feel like this is what you were meant to do is to uh to be smart and then um you know package that up and perform that because you can't educate without entertaining and you do a great job of both um thanks for coming on we really appreciate it thank you guys congrats on your success yeah thank you we I think you and I I I think our pods are are uh going back and forth sometimes in the chart so I look forward to uh uh kick in your ass I will bury you see you trenches uh thanks man we appreciate it Scott Galloway thanks again guys that's the [Music] pod

uh Sam what's up man I got uh I got some good news for you great click that link I just put in there it's uh oh it's your lucky day bro here's an article in the financial times called the alpha of ugliness and it turns out that being ugly outperforms they analyzed a bunch of investors and the investors who were conventionally ugly uh outperformed by 2% I think so uh yeah I I saw that but here's the problem I'm I'm a f I'm 5'10 I'm not ugly enough to be made fun of but I'm definitely not hot enough to be 6 foot to get any advantages yeah so damn it that's the issue should I get uglier or hotter I guess [Music] uglier yeah when I was in second grade I really liked this one girl and I was like um hey uh I want to ask that girl to the whatever the dance or something like we had like some party in like third grade and um now that I think about it that's kind of young to be asking girls but that's what happened so I went up to her or no my friend went up to her and he was like hey Sean likes you and she goes um Sean's ugly and then that was third grade and then I'm still reeling I'm 3 I'm 35 now I'm hoping at 36 I'm I'm off that but uh you know still recovering I would say our software is the wor worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better so Anan the founder of CB insights tweeted this out I think a week ago and he does really in-depth tweets where he looks at data and stuff and he had this one thing where he said um he said uh I found this data that talks about how good you look and your returns and a lot of people think that the hotter you are or the taller you are the better returns you're going to have that which which makes sense taller people get more get better treatment and he said no it's the opposite there's a uh correlation between attractiveness or I guess an opposite correlation so between attractiveness and rate of returns for investment managers well yeah because the the investment doesn't know how tall you are you know tall guy probably could raise more money but not necessarily make more money um well and it's uh I guess is it the uglier you are the harder you've had to work yeah that's I've been clinging to that's the story I've been telling myself so speaking of hedge funds or Investments let me ask you a question okay do you know anything about hedge funds not a lot okay they what you need to know is they work really hard and it's a really intense lifestyle so you understand that I'm sure would if I paid you $10 million a year if you could earn $10 million a year would you be a hedge fund would you work at a hedge fund as like a like a portfolio manager would you live that lifestyle for $10 million I don't know the lifestyle but probably not cuz I really like my lifestyle so I would not trade it for a worse lifestyle if that makes sense but like let's assume let's assume uh 10 years ago would I have made that trade yeah I would have made that trade and that's what I think they do I think they they make that trade earlier in their career and then they get that's what they do so I'm reading this book about Steve Cohen do you know who Steve Cohen is he owns uh sports teams and he's like one of the he's one of the most successful hedg fun guys but and I think billions is based off of him right uh roughly yeah so Bobby oxar is off him but basically Steve Cohen he started as a uh B he's basically a day trader a glorified day trader that's how he made his first couple billion worked at like billion dollars day trading yeah that that that's not the best explanation but but but but basically uh it's day trading on steroids so it's uh kind of like calling like a bodybuilder like oh you like to exercise but it was basically his own money or he was at a a it started with his own so well he started as a he started as a kid 23 years old he worked at like something that looked like The Wolf Wall Street style setup where it was like a dingy in the beginning of that Wolf Wall Street he's selling Petty stocks at like a like a garage basically in a small like 30% operation he kind of started at a thing like this the story is and and they interviewed his boss in this book they're like dude on this first day of work he came and he goes if I was you I would do that and make that trade and the the boss was like who do you think you are telling me what to do on your first day of work and Steve was like that's I'm telling you that's going to work within a few hours it made eight grain of profit after two years he was making 100 Grand in profit a day for the firm and it was like a day it was like a day trading firm where they basically in the 80s it wasn't quite popular to do day trading it was more so uh hold something for a long period of time picks based off the businesses he's so good because he's a savant because he figures out some Arbitrage and he's exploiting that why is he making 100 grand a day so at first it was he claimed it was intuition which I believe he claims that he's a bad at math which is uncommon for a lot of these folks but he claims he's bad at math and it was intuition he said I would just look at the ticker it was at the time it was a a physical ticker that would be on the board and it would like change stock prices and he was like I would just find these weird arbitrages and it was he he he would short stocks based off of like this just changed by $1 I think it should be 50 c higher I'm going to buy it and sell it within a few hours it's incredibly challenging reading this book to figure out exactly how he did this that's so frustrating as an answer by the way it's like you know that's like my idiot friend from college who's looking at the roulette wheel and it's like guys I'm it's got to be red it's been black four times in a row and I'm like that's not how this works um that's very frustrating if that's the answer of how this guy became you know a billionaire is good old gut I just don't I don't know I don't believe that that sounds crazy to me it's very frustrating TW TI like Rainman and just figured out which direction things are going to go well I tweeted out about it and Martin scarelli who worked in the HED fund world has been replying to my tweets and he's like yeah it does seem like intuition based more so intuition-based like when you're playing blackjack or poker you know roughly the odds as you're going really quickly the problem with Steve Cohen is he's never done a wonderful job of explaining exactly how he did it however at the age of like 32 he started his own fund he had $10 million of his own money and that's what he started uh sa that's what the his firm was called and he hired um a bunch of people and he gave them like crazy commissions where you could earn 30% of the profits you made the firm and by the time he's like 42 sa which is mostly his own money accumulates like 10 billion however after the first like $600 million then it's all not all but it's a lot of insider trading and they would do crazy [ __ ] like they would fly to conferences take the conference speaker out to dinner at a at a conference where they're like talking about like different drugs that might become uh legal based off of different trials that the're current L running they basically bribe these guys to give them information like this trial's going really bad trouble for this or um or no cuz he's I'm looking it up Steve Cohen net worth 19.8 billion and appears to be a free man so yeah so here's the here's here's the rub he uh does get in trouble for it but after he's worth already probably five or 10 billion dollars he's they do it very quietly he's been very quiet for years building accumulating about a billion dollars he do later huh then he gets trouble and you want to know something he completely gets away with it he gets convicted and he gets in trouble sa has to shut down technically although now it just becomes his family office a year later he starts another firm called 72 the guy he did not get in trouble at all clearly broke the law many many many many times however as I'm reading this book I'm reading about the the lifestyle of what it's like it is 7 days a week 12 hours a day more than 12 hours a day before you do the lifestyle thing I want to read Martin's reply to you so you were like like this guy Steve Cohen fascinating what I don't understand you know he's basically became worth over $100 million as a day trader on steroids it says he followed his intuition as bad as math what does that mean so great question so here's what Martin says I studied Cohen for a good part of my life and I think these were the key components as a Trader he has an unbelievably capacious memory for stocks capacious wow that's a word I love that I don't I don't quite know what it means but you'll see me sprinkling that around for for the next three days all right I guess it means good we'll just say good good or spacious one of the two yeah so for any given stock he literally knows what is the situation and controversy this is a little bit like how it impresses some people that Kramer knows most of the stocks he's asked about they are similar Animals number two he is unwavering on discipline and portfolio firm structure with leverage and a diversified group of portfolio managers the net result for investors is incredible other firms like Millennium and sville have figured this out too con is also a very smart business person which most Traders are not not he can attract impressive talent because he speaks the Traders language whereas other similar firms don't have active Traders managing the company I think it's a competitive Advantage the style has been somewhat effectively replicated by his competitors however and the Arbitrage has all but vanished in US public equities yeah so that's still not the best answer right that's a very um that answer doesn't feel good like it's not giving me exactly what I wanted he he said one more thing that I think is great you were like it's crazy that he was getting you know 30 to 50% Annual fees he goes remember Mar goes remember that's 50% net of fees so his fees were 50% so basically he had 10 years we made about 100% a year it's arguably the strongest stretch of high returns ever done similar to Renaissance Capital it's amazing and this guy he's he's sneaky he's a sneaky guy he's he does a he does a lot of bad things in in this book like okay tell me some of them for example um you know GLG which we've talked about constantly expert NK he was Yeah so basically what GLG does I'm a consultant technically every once in a while on GLG so uh a bank is going to take a company public they let's say it's um HubSpot for example they want to know all about email marketing they find email marketers and ask them about which software they use they want to learn about if it's a good company or not whatever well seep Cen was glg's biggest customer he spent millions of dollars a year he would become friends with the quote consultants get their information take them out to dinner and be like look just tell me the truth and I'll put you on salary tell me like for example if you're uh if you're on this board if you work for the government and you're getting ready to approve a drug just tell me if it's going to get approved tell me how the trials are going this napkin I've written the number three and as you keep talking I will start adding zeros go yeah I mean it was basic like that like that and then they get the information from the guys and they just they basically like they they Honeypot these guys where they become friends with them ask about their families and then they get the information and they bail they never see them again sounds like you're dating life back in the day actually but by the way this GLG thing is really funny uh so when you do these calls tell me if you're like me so I've done a couple of these calls talk really slow yeah first of all it's like eighth grade and I'm trying to hit the word count Yeah Yeah so basically GLG they pay by the hour you could charge three grand an hour I become very capacious yeah I feel absolutely silly doing these like I know in my head like there's an intellectual part of me that's like of course course $2,000 an hour hell yeah I should be making that and you know what this is going to be such this I'm giving them Liquid Gold that's what in my head I say that however during it I become very insecure about what I'm saying and I'm like none of this is special this is all so basic what I'm saying and I feel like I'm a high paid escort that doesn't know how to have sex and I'm like I hope they're happy with what they're getting here for this $2,000 hour because did you ask him if it was good for them it's a it's a weird thing I don't actually do it anymore but in this book so one of the ways they made like a billion dollars was doing this for drugs and they found out to their investigation that 10% of us doctors admitted to being one of these Consultants on some of these networks and that's only the people who admitted it and so it was like a it's like a pretty widespread problem uh my takeaway so far in the book is um if you're a white C CRI criminal you could basically get away with it you can get away with it um that's crazy so he got evicted of insider trading and what did he have to pay and did he go to jail he paid billions he did not go to jail wow maybe he paid two billion but he started a new firm the next the next year right he paid two billion as he laughed uncontrollably um all right so you were going to talk about like their work culture sounded like um yeah so I got obsessed with this work culture and I saw this um quote by uh Keith R boy and so Keith R boy was at Pomp's conference and he talks about 996 do you know what 996 is means Chinese work schedule it's a Chinese work schedule it stands for 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a week and he Keith stance it seems is he loves 996 and he tells a story about one of his portfolio companies they just hired the CFO and the woman who got the job she was like I was specifically looking looking for a 996 culture and I googled and I found out that on your job listing you said that you guys were 996 and that seems crazy to me because that I don't think is a lifestyle that I want and so I was curious about 996 and so I got down this I went down this Rabbit Hole of of of working so do you know the history have you ever read the history of like the 40-hour work week do you know how it came to be um roughly here's what I know you tell me where where I'm missing something which is just that when we went to like the factory industrial thing that's when the 40-hour work week of going into theot quotequote office the the the plant the factory became a thing um it wasn't that way before so somewhat Yeah so basically in the book sapiens the author hypothesizes that hunter gatherers you know we're talking pre- civilization worked something like 30 hours a week and spent a lot of time just being idle with family then the Industrial Revolution comes along and factories and machines come about and in the late 1800s early 1900s uh there was a bunch of surveys done amongst the workers and it was found on average most of them were working 100 hours a week 6 days a week uh so they're working constantly and it was a grind there was constant like protests there was constantly people fighting over this there was legisl legislation that went into uh Power in both England and America in like the 1920s where it was like government workers you don't have to work that much we're going to give you a normal work week but basically Factory workers didn't get [ __ ] then in the 1920s Henry Ford was like Hey look uh the thing about our guys working so much and my company is so big had Ford Ford Motor Company I I need people to buy cars because if they're working so much they can't buy pants they can't buy shirts they can't go out to eat and thus they can't buy cars therefore I'm going to try this thing where we're going to create the weekend we're going to give Saturday and Sunday off because if they don't buy [ __ ] people aren't going to buy cars so in the 1920s Henry Ford says the weekend's a thing and that was the beginning of the 40 hour work week at least in terms of like it being systematic Henry Ford created the weekend he made it like a thing yeah uh yeah he was the he was the first big company to make it a thing yeah and he he made it a thing and what he found was he did something crazy at the time he goes hey workers guess what I'm giving you Saturday and Sunday off I'm not even going to touch your pay your pay is going to stay the same and that was really revolutionary at the time his workers ended up loving him more he also did a bunch of crazy stuff so he built towns so there's towns similar to what Facebook does Now and Google they actually like give you a stip in if you live within 5 miles of the office because he was like I want you to be close to the office I want you to be available when you can but I'm going to give you Saturdays and Sundays off and that was kind of the beginning of the weekend and then since then that's kind of become standard uh even though he gave them the weekend people were still working 12 hours a day so he was people were working 60 hours a week but then he eventually lowered it a bit to 40 hours a week and that became kind of what the 40-hour work week in America is for workers and so he sort of invented that what a legend yeah well he's done a lot of bad stuff too so so I just Googled uh so Sunday were kind of casually off but it was like for church but he's the one who made Saturday also off basically and then also the the 40 Hour Work Week versus 70h hour work week which is crazy yeah and he didn't change their pay he goes I'm gonna I'm gonna give you what you want bad stuff Henry Ford did like how bad how bad are we talking super anti-semitic so he big fan of Hitler uh wrote books called like I think he has a famous book I forget exactly what it's called but it's called like our problem and it's like basically why Jews are bad oh wow so yeah he so very very imperfect person but that's okay we could talk about the 40-hour work week which is interesting um and so that worked out and that's how the 40-hour work week came to be now over time a lot of companies have tested four day weeks and some claim that it's effective but I think the verdict still out these things are really hard to measure and then I went and read a bunch of studies on what's the optimal amount of work time have you ever studied what the optimal amount of work time is no a lot of research says that humans can only focus and concentrate really hard 5 hours a day that's what some of this research says there's also a ton of research that shows that there's like um stupidly High uh it's like 30% increase of heart attack blood pressure things like that of anything above 50 hours a week and so there's like a huge issue at 996 in health and I've read enough biographies to know there's definitely a trend like can like have you ever heard the story of like rich people having in the 18 or 1900s having to go to Florida for fresh air cuz they needed to like relax or they have like stomach ulcers have you ever like heard like there's like a no I don't read history books there's a pretty like common story amongst Ty air pollution or because of something else well they were just like having nervous breakdowns like it it was like it's like a common thing amongst the biographies and the doctors would be like you need fresh air you have to go to Florida you need fresh air you're having a nervous breakdown it's a very common thing of these of these guys like Joseph Kennedy um John Rockefeller having to retire for basically or take a three-month sabatical because they're broken you know John Rockefeller at the end of his life you know what Alpa is yeah he had Alpa so at the age of 50 he lost all of his hair and that's a stressinduced disease at least a lot of people think so so is your uh first of all couple questions number one is 996 still in effect I thought I had heard something that China was like rolling that back that they don't do that anymore technically it's illegal um but still maybe some people are do but still it's practice so for example there's a lot of quotes that says uh like jd.com as well as Jack ma from Alibaba there's quotes where they're like like look like do you want to be successful if you do you have to do 996 and they like say this on record in their weed chat talking about it right so it's still common I think though there is an interesting point here which is I think Americans in particular don't want you want to create a narrative about why China can potentially beat us and you say to yourself like all they care about is work work work work work and I just don't want that life and so there could be this the case of like well they don't actually work significantly harder than Americans but that's just the excuse that we're going to give in our head because in reality I think a small percentage of Chinese companies are still doing 996 in general a lot of the young Chinese are revolting against that and that's one of the reasons why you see a lot of Chinese American workers I think because they prefer the American Style versus the Chinese style so okay so that's what's going on in China uh Keith R boy says that he runs his companies on 996 no guy's at Barry's boot camp like twice a day what what he talking about so here's what he said so there's company called Tava which uh ironically is a software for it's a service for warehouse workers to help uh factories find warehouse workers he says um it's a 996 in the office every single person every single day it's very uh impressive and it's not surprising why that company has done so well in fact he says this is why the Asian companies succeed because they do 996 so yeah as an investor you love when your companies do 996 why not of course of course you love it um okay next thing do you um do you feel that with Hampton you're going to be the Henry Ford of Our Generation and take us down to the 5H hour work day rather than the 8 hour work day is that a thing you're doing because I'm trying to bring in I'm trying to revolutionize the adult nap right like you know the adult nap is going to be my lasting Legacy uh when I die people are going to be napping in the middle of the day and they're going to every day they're going to thank Sean for for bringing this new nap culture to to adult adulthood naps I've read thousands or I've read hundreds of biographies naps are very common amongst a lot of the people I've read about by the way so if it makes you feel good naps are common you read about Legends Legends nap I nap therefore Sean L equals Legend yeah you're Indian you're good at math you get it um uh do I think that no I think the 40-hour work week I I don't think it's broken that's what I think I don't think it's broken like how many how many hours a day do you are you like actively trying to work and then how many hours a day do you think you're productive I'm those two numbers so like I don't plant 9 to six I don't like that that's I I treat my running my companies I like I remember my parents were like oh you work for yourself you can come out to lunch with us I'm like no 9 to 6 it's my job I'm available and I'm working right so I say that I'm 9 to6 I spend a lot of time thinking like I literally just be sitting there thinking writing notes so if you consider that work I think I work 40 hours a week if you consider work like typing and actually contributing to a product way less 10 hours a week yeah I do the same thing where I'm like it's awesome I'm My Own Boss problem I'm an [ __ ] as a boss to myself you know like I work harder when I'm My Own Boss versus if somebody else was managing me but nowadays with kids uh my schedule's very different I basically do these sort of like three- hour Sprints three times a day but at different times so like this right now is my first Sprint it basically starts at usually 8:30 or 9 and I'll go till 11:30 or noon then I go play with my kids for a little bit which is honestly only like 20 30 minutes but we'll do something fun and then I'll come back I'll do another 90 minutes in that that next block then I'll go workout and then after the workout I got another 90 minutes so that's kind of like the second block is those two 90 minutes just split with a workout and then late at night after my kids sleep I'll do another 90 minutes and so I don't know what that adds up to 909090 uh plus the 3 hours in the morning but that's how much I work which probably like six seven hours a day and and by the way I I I I don't I think I kind of glossed over this but at bite dance they currently have employees work six days a week every 14 days and then uh what's the big um what's the big like phone company over there is it called Hawai how do you how you pronounce that H they routinely ask staff for six day weeks every month um and they give and they pay them extra for it right um so like it's still pretty common but at the end of a 40 Hour Work Week where it's been a hard week I find myself fried like I I I'll sit and like either play a video game or like watch TV like I I can't do much I don't know how a guy like Elon mus or some of these folks like have in intellectual stimulation for that long uh I find it to be very very challenging and and I personally cannot do it so would I take $10 million a year to be a hedge fund portfolio manager and live that life where you're on call 20 hours a day maybe for $20 million a year for 10 million probably not I think it' be hard hard I mean there's a number right there's a number where you would do it for a couple years I mean not to put you on blast but like you're already going to be creating that much or more value without doing it so why would you ever make that trade right like it's not it doesn't make I didn't say I would I said maybe I said there's a number there is a number I I that number has to be pretty high 10 million not a chance 20 probably not I I I don't know yeah but that sounded like uh that that probably not there sounded like give me three more seconds of silence and I'll changed my mind but have you ever read a book like have you ever watched James Bond and you see the villain's lifestyle and you're like that's exciting I want to do bad stuff that's what that's what working at a head head fun is yeah does does do does do it Hoodrat stuff with your friends that's what it feels like you're doing bad stuff with your homies and it that can that does seem you the one sexy thing I like about hedphones so there was a guy when I was in college guy comes into the office our guy comes into our our class slick back hair and I forgot his name but his dad is like a legend in the hedge fund game like he was like one of the OG hedge fun guys who made a billion dollars or whatever this is the son son's got his own hedge fun and he comes in and he just had you know when you like you guys were talking before we started recording about like the somehow the like more successful and rich people get the ACT actually the more like at peace and like chill they are when you they're they're more generous with their time ironically and they're uh nicer and Kinder so this guy kind of had that energy where he was in no rush and I just remember I could literally feel that energy coming off that this guy was in no rush which was very different than every other person I had seen who was this person we're always rushing from one class to the next or cramming for finals and [ __ ] like that like this like high achiever stress it's just like who was this person I forgot his name um regardless guy comes in and he's there to give a talk and he says basically two interesting things that always stuck with me first thing he said was he he's talking about his hedge fund and and blah blah blah we're all all kind of like eating out the palm of his hand and he's like you know who here would find it fun to work at a fun like RS and and do this like make big bets for a living and like you know 80% of the class hands up and he goes um he goes okay so look around here's 80% of the PE 80% of the class just raise their hand and imagine if you all applied because somebody had asked them a question about risk like how much you know should I should I work this career ladder or should I try this thing that's like a little bit of a risk and so he's explaining he goes look around he goes imagine of you applied to this job what would your resume look like all of you would give me a white piece of paper with black text you'd put your little name at the top and then You' put Duke University and you'd put your stupid GPA and then you put your internships you put four internships and You' you make it sound like you're you changed the world in those internships he goes there is nothing that differentiates you he goes you have a degree great that's table Stakes like you know like oh great you went to a good school like so what so did everybody else that applies to this job he goes the only thing I can look at to even decide do I want to meet this person is the bottom fifth of your resume the very bottom 20% where it says other and that's your chance to say other stuff you're into your interest your sto something you've done that's remarkable or or notable he goes that's the only way I'm going to differentiate between all of you that are raising your hands right now because otherwise you're all students you all did an internship you all got a threo whatever GPA it doesn't matter um that you were on student counsil like no one cares and when he said he goes so I would take the next three years four years of Your Life After College and I would go stuff that other column cuz either you're going to make it big doing something cool or even if all those fail when you go to apply to a job like mine I'm going to have some reason to actually want to talk to you and that was one of the most I don't know profound things but like best pieces of career advice that I had ever heard and actually changed my I went and started a goddamn sushi restaurant afterwards because I was like that's part of my other they either this works I create the next Chipotle or it's a great story from my other section because he's right like that ring that that that was the truth was told to me and the commonality between a lot of these folks which I I think you have um they played poker and they got really comfortable uh gambling so so that was the other thing that stood out he's looking around and in class everybody's got a laptop open and he's looking around I'm like I could see he's like counting or something he's like measuring something and I asked him I go are you I was like what are you counting what are you what are you doing he goes oh I'm looking at how many of you guys have Macs versus PCS he goes because my entire year right now is I'm going to make a long short bet I'm either going to go long Microsoft and short apple or I'm going to go long apple and short Microsoft and he was like I was like what I don't even know what I didn't even understand what he was talking about like a long short sort of spread trade and he was like um yeah so like you know my entire like he's like I'm going to make a $10 million bet or I'm going to make a whatever he said some ridiculously big number he goes I just have to make one bet this year and I'm going to bet 10 or 50 million on either apple or Microsoft here and so I'm just trying to understand like what do you guys using and why why why do you pick this and I thought that was the coolest [ __ ] in the world like that was like you know he could have lit up a blunt in front of me and I wouldn't have thought he was cooler than what he just said that his entire year was to figure out should he be long apple or Microsoft and he was just gonna walk around the world trying to figure this out he's gonna make a $50 million do bet on it and I was like that's so cool that's incredible and I'm sitting here playing like poker during class you know on the one two tables trying to make 200 bucks and this guy was like gambling at a whole another level on one concentrated bet that [ __ ] was like very attractive to me I wonder uh which one he picked uh hopefully I think he had told us at the time I had asked him I was like so which one he's like I think Apple because and he had said some reasoning because of Apple it wasn't just like apple cuz it's cool it was something like he was looking in the education Market to figure out like basically our age cohort what were we buying what were the schools like recommending and then what was like the he had done I forgot exactly what he was doing but he was like looking at basically like he thought that it was important to know what high schoolers and college kids and like young professionals were being told to buy and buying voluntarily and if there was like some difference there he had said something now this is like 15 years ago I don't remember the exacts but I remember it being Apple that he was leaning towards so that's my whole summary of hedge funds of um the 40-hour work week um this stuff interests me Henry Ford by the way came up with a lot of good stuff invented Kingsford Charcoal uh that was his doing um obviously for assembly got side the uh assembly line uh the guy is super fascinating a very imperfect person did a lot of bad stuff too but very interesting um what do you want to do all right so I saw something come come by that um I think you'll find pretty fascinating have you heard about this company called law and crime speaking they were acquired recently they were Acquired and so this is a media company that does a combination of like True Crime plus just coverage of Trials and Media company started by this guy Dan Abrams and they got acquired for a rumored nine figures and I was like wow that's a pretty impressive exit for like this kind of like crime Niche media thing um do you know about this guy Dan Abrams he's got a like an interesting backstory no what's he do so he's basically pretty prolific with these like Niche media sites so 2009 he launches something called gossip cop it's celebrity gossip blog and uh it gets to 8 million monthly uniques so he goes into celebrity gossip that's number one I go to tmz.com every day homepage a home P every single day every day that's what that's on my list of things that I check every morning that's part of your eight hour workday well you know you got like the same the news websites that you check I just want to see what's going on I check no news websites but anyways this guy so then he creates geosystem um which is a internet site for meme culture launches that in 2010 he creates uh something called mediate which is basically power rankings for media personalities that one gets to 14 million monthly unique still going today uh he launched something called stylite which is kind of like the same thing Power Rankings but for designers models writers like people in the style business holy [ __ ] Sports grid which is a sports news business that was acquired in 2013 so he's creating a bunch of these all in this period of like 2009 to 2015 roughly he created all of those that I just mentioned uh he created one more in 2012 called brazer which was basically personality like Chef personalities and um I'm like this guy's like a that's just interesting like an interesting model but B like all of those are like the right niches like there's like you know missionary versus mercenary people like he strikes me as somebody who's mercenary where he's like oh these like these idiots care about like you know celebrity chefs all right here you go I'm going to tell you every goddamn thing you need to know news information um you know stories about these celebrity chefs oh these people love um you know whatever whatever it is styli you know media personalities or style or celebrity gossip great I'm going to create I'm going to go fulfill demand I got thirsty customers I'll go open up lemonade stands right next to them that's the that's the style of Entrepreneurship that I get out of this guy and if you Google this guy and you click images most people were recognize him do you recognize him I I he's on MSNBC he's on TV all the time yeah exactly uh he's like really goodl looking he's got a great voice he's always commenting on like like one another guilty pleasure I watch Cops all the time I freaking love cops that's my favorite show uh and and they have like a spin-off called live PD he's always on there saying like oh what she did she's about to get charged with X Y and Z right so this guy he's basically a media entrepreneur and he's on yeah like all the all the things that you mentioned he um so Abra media I guess is the thing that's like launching all this stuff one of the things he launches so 2016 he launches law and crime that's the one he just sold it's basically it starts you know legal news website then it's live streaming trials then they have a cable show they have an OT show they have a YouTube channel they got 5 million subscribers on YouTube they cover every trial cuz like I'm like pretty kneed deep in this s SPF trial right now can't look away from the car wreck you know like rarely does news get me but this one I mean I'm I'm I'm embraced in its arms laughing it up yeah I I'm just fully engulfed by this SPF trial and so um definitely there's like this like part of our brains that's just wired to tune into the stuff like I watched the Depp verse herd Netflix show I don't know if you saw that one really really well done like the Netflix documentary on the Johnny Depp trial and uh you can't I mean you you watch these things and you just get fully engrossed in them so he you know he sees that creates this and they raise $5 million bucks and reportedly have sold for nine figures so over $100 million I don't know if that's exactly true uh three years ago the reported Revenue was like 13 million Topline and so you know who knows where where it landed at maybe it's at 20 25 million now I'm not exactly sure but amazing exit and kind of amazing entrepreneur career he also by the way launched during the time he was launching True Crime uh law on crime he launched a Christian TV streaming service called ambot TV which I bet is also like that's I love that Niche um you know which is crazy I mean the guy's not Christian um at all uh so that that's very I said do you know Dan you didn't know the guy you're like he's not Christian well Abrams is a Jewish last name and I'm looking at his um um I'm looking at his Wikipedia and he's he's it says he was raised in a Jewish family and his his father has a Wikipedia page and I'm looking Point Sam um all right so this what's the Christian show so go to ambot tv.com and so they're just live streaming like you know uh I don't know good old Christian entertainment I don't I don't know what they it's not something I normally watch but like you could watch basically like live biblical literacy you can watch like you know inside one of these churches the Christ Evangelical like Church live you can view past sermons you can watch interviews and shows and uh this thing doesn't seem to have a ton of traffic on here but let me look at the YouTube channel I bet the YouTube Channel's n it's pretty small too so the this Christian site thing it looks like hasn't hasn't quite taken off uh yet but I do like this Niche I feel like this could be could be successful as well and then he has another one called whiskey Raiders a site that uses a proprietary algorithm to rate whiskies on a scale of 50 to 100 yeah I mean this guy just goes into passion niches right so it's like passionate Niche let me create it right like this is what Ramone did with a soap oper blog it's like wow you built and sold a soap oper blog for $9 million that's like incredible how do you even have this idea idea and he was like well I created Facebook pages around a bunch of Niche topics wrestling politics um soap operas and others and I saw that the fan page for these soap operas was like popping off it was like the second or third most most popular one and so then he created a Blog he had never seen a s proper in his life and created a Blog where they would write spoilers and and Recaps and stories about the so propers and built up so much traffic he was able to sell it for almost $10 million without ever raising any money it was incredible but by the way the the what this guy is doing uh Abrams Dan Abrams how he's launch he's prolifically launching new stuff I think media is the best industry if your intention is to launch a lot of things someone kind of described it once where they told me that a media company is basically um a collection of different projects all under one brand whereas a software company typically is one product with added features and you're just scaling it um the interesting thing about media is when you understand what types of things grabs people uh attentions uh attention and how to look at certain numbers to understand where there's an underserved nerd uh uh underserved need and nerd and nerd yeah uh you can basically do that for any Niche that like you're like there's it's a formula um a lot different than software um eCommerce is a lot like that too uh you notice that some somebody who knocks it out of the park with want e-commerce thing they know that they could do this five times over it's just do they have the energy and the the desire to create an organization that's going to launch multiple Brands versus the one but it's so applicable to do exactly what you did for one for but there's a problem with e-commerce which is your cash is tied up in inventory with media you typically have more operating cash flow and so you have more money to deploy to some of these resources uh how many how much of your how much of your business so you have a business in in e-commerce business how much of the money is in inventory a significant amount without saying like particular numbers probably 30% in inventory so not not not that's not horrible that's that's not horrible A lot of times it's worse so I would imagine it can you can go wrong if you if you mess up if you mis forecast or you get a bunch of dead stock slow moving inventory yeah you can that can stockpile real quickly and become a big issue for you but also it depends how you run it so in the same way that there's a 100 people now trying to create newsletter businesses and those hundred are not going to have the same success that you did with the hustle or that I had with milk Road why is that right because it's how you operate the same thing with the eCommerce you know with e-commerce if you set up the right payment terms with your factory like for example like for us we sell inventory before we we have to pay money for it yeah so that's great right negative cash conversion so once you get set up like that then you're you know you you're an idiot if you're if you're losing money or you're tying up too much money in inventory right because that's not necess uh if you run it well it's when you make a mistake or or the market turns that you know you you can get in trouble tell me about this guy Tyler and what his post said I I I think I know who he is yeah so I don't know T about this guy this guy Tyler Hodge I've seen him on Twitter he's around on on Twitter but he wrote a great blog post that I I I loved um I don't know if you saw this but it was about sardines did you see uh this blog post about sardines so I didn't see it but I'm pulling it up now by the way the blog post it's going to make a comeback I think dude I'm with you I read this one post and I was like I don't know who this Tyler guy is but I like him I was like I like him and I respect him uh one one blog post could do that for you it's very hard for that to happen in like you know a single tweet or an Instagram story or um a Tik Tok short right like it's like it takes a little bit more one blog post you need more time yeah exactly I think podcast work well with it but um podcast YouTube videos if they're longer work it's basically the amount of uh time that you've taken from someone like that's how inv post and he's like uh he's like I'm reading this book margin of safety and in it he writes about this famous bubble that happened that you probably haven't heard of I guess not that famous but there was a bubble that happened that you probably are not aware of which was the Sardine bubble in Southern California so I'm going to read it out for you here he goes there's an old story about a market craze in sardine trading where um sardines disappeared from their Waters in Monteray and so the commodity Traders started bidding up the price of a can of sardines the price of one can of sardines sword and everybody's buying up these cans of sardines they're making a bunch of money flipping them and one day a buyer decides you know what I'm going to treat myself to I'm going to take one of these expensive cans of sardines I'm going to pop it open and I'm going to enjoy he pops it open and immediately just becomes sick he's vomiting and he's like oh he's like tells the seller he's like hey man I bought these expensive sardines for you these are no good and the seller's like you don't understand these these are not eating sardines these are trading sardines and he's like uh so then Tyler draws the point he's like it feels like this is what's happened in the last few years with like um tech company valuations he's like there was a b like there was a game to be played you would invest in the seed round and then the A and you're you this Company's trying to use that money to grow it's not really profitable but don't worry about that right we're losing money but it's it's all good we're growing and we got this narrative and the narrative just needed to be sold to the next round investor the B you know the better analogy for this is crypto well uh I don't think it's quite in cry there is some in crypto right but like there's the nft stuff in crypto but the difference is um to get to the point of what he's saying so crypto is a different type of asset right crypto is not a a productive asset it's not a cash fling asset so what he's talking about he's like you would get these businesses that would go later and later stage and um each round is getting bigger and bigger because everybody is basically it's greater fool Theory right they're they're thinking well I don't care if this business actually generates a lot of free cash flow I can just sell it to the next to the next buyer and they would do that they would get to the point where it goes public uh but now the music stopped and these companies have to be you know they're opening up the Kanas sardines and realizing that oh [ __ ] these were not eating sardines these are trading sardines and so you see a company like hoppen go from $4 billion do valuation or $2 billion valuation whatever it was to I think it's sold for like 10 million bucks or 20 million bucks the other day like you know it's down whatever 100x from from its you know Peak valuation just two years ago and uh there's another company called better which is like a a mortgage company that's also like you know about to go bankrupt after a billion dollar valuation and this is going to keep happening you're going to see a bunch of you know the sort of dead unicorns and in crypto there was a a a version of this like nfts for example are you buying this because you love the art are you buying this because you think the price is going to go up and up for 95% of the people 99% of the people it was I'm buying this because the price is going to go up that works until the price stops going up and then at that point we all are sitting here holding these like you know these trading sardines that we don't want to eat um the difference of course is that and the point that Tyler's made making is that what's in Vogue now is eating sardines companies where if you couldn't sell it to the next but if you can't exit if you can't IPO if you can't go raise the next round well doesn't matter just pop it open and eat it right doesn't matter just the company has profits it has cash flow so we can we don't need to flip this to the next person it produces enough cash flow and um you know this sounds very basic to a lot of people like the whole idea of crypto is triggering to them or the idea of capital and these unprofitable tech companies that raise money at these crazy valuations that's just triggering to them um and so you know for the cash flow Kings out there this is like you know today is your day now is your era you're you're you are now kind of like King of the Hill at the moment and I wanted to bring this up with you because I feel like you have really never gotten into any of these trading games I have never seen you get swept up in Angel Investing where you're like yeah this this company today it's worth 10 million even though it's got no product and no Revenue but it doesn't matter because they'll raise an a at 50 million I'll be marked up 5x and then it'll raise a b at 120 million I'll be marked up 10x whatever I've never seen you fall into that one or crypto really any of these trading games you seem to be a guy who always goes into eating sardines games whereas I've dabbled in both and made money and lost money in in sort of both um I'm curious what your reaction is to this yeah so a bunch the first thing is the reason I've never got into that is I think people default to be being too optimistic about particular businesses um you know what's interesting is um one of the very one of the very first signs or pieces of writing that humans have ever discovered we're talking caveman era they wrote on the on the um they wrote on the cave that said the generation after them is lazy and they just don't care and that's like a common theme every generation says the L the one after them is lazy they just don't care sucks yeah their music sucks it's like the same thing over and over again and you said something about we're caught up in this at the moment My Philosophy is we have always been caught up in that human nature doesn't change we have been the same for almost forever and the way that we act today is the way we have always reacted and so when I see new things I think this isn't new this has been here many many many many times and my goal is to find out what has been here for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years and what or thousands of years and that is where I choose to place my time in um for example in this blog post uh she he quotes Sarah G who says who's like a famous investor and apparently uh one of her portfolio companies said Sarah tell all the founders their job is to generate cash flow because no one has ever told me that and that's crazy but that's a common thing yeah and I was I'm taking this do you know how to read a balance sheet or cash flow statement or profit p&l yes but you know of course there's there's levels to that game so I I I I don't really know how to read it and so I'm taking a my intend to take a course at like I I want to do like one of these Executive MBA classes like one of these fancy ones but before I even did this I bought this course it's called the 4day MBA where this guy's teaching me how to read a balance sheet and his whole course is summarized in a very simple way and it's um basically the point of cash is to generate or to buy uh buy stuff that you can then sell to create profit which that profit can turn into cash flow and a lot of times people focus on profit but profit is a is a hypothesis cash is a fact and it took me to take that course to realize and get back to basics of like wait everything is about creating cash flow yeah and he uses this wonderful example of Enron he's like check this out look at this balance sheet they're generating lots of profit lots of profit Goldman Morgan Stanley they're all saying buy this company buy this company their stocks great at the pnl the p&l will show you the profit no that's the issue is profit isn't important operating cash flow is on paper they were making lots of profit the problem is is that it was all they weren't like they weren't actually making profit uh or they were rather but they weren't creating operating cash flow the vast majority of their cash came from financing activities a raising more money and this is why there's a book called the smartest guys in the room because apparently everyone was like oh they'll be fine they're the smartest guys in the room and you see these Trends today with crypto with web 3 now with AI before that with social media where the smartest guys in the room say it's okay that they're not making profit it's okay that they're not making cash it's okay that this valuation is huge but that's a just a common problem that we see over and over and over again and so I get suspicious of all of those things because I read a lot of history and you see patterns and this is a very common thing we have thought this way from the beginning um so the story of the tech industry like V the story of all the the startup industry Silicon Valley is that that actually was correct like you're saying it like uh what social media the story was these companies um you know failed most failed of course of course some worked but that's what I think what what it is the real the real lesson is you have to know what game you're playing so for example correct I I agree when you're playing the Silicon Valley game the Silicon Valley game is most of these companies are going to fail or be sort of um inconsequential to your Returns the only thing that matters when you're doing you know venture capital or doing Tech investing is every year there's like 20 maybe 30 companies that matter did you get into them how many of those did you get into is it zero is it one is it two is it three the issue though is that people put too large of a percentage of their net worth into these things that's where it becomes a huge problem and a lot of people do that I I I don't think that's true I think most people are not even invested in startups the average person can like zero get startups out of this example you could say crypto you could I mean a lot of people have gone broke because of it um and at the the underlying asset still does not have like a repeatable way to deliver cash flows that's that's the difference uh you know uh there are different types of assets so for example um you could buy a watch or you could buy art they're never going to produce cash flow uh you can buy gold bars they're never going to produce cash flow there's different definely certain types of art certain Rolex Rolexes have grown no they're not they're nonproductive assets but they are Collectibles but there is a history of uh hundreds 100 years 50 years of repeat of people wanting to purchase it of course of course not much not not as much with crypto yeah and of course and of course that the of course you don't get the same same upside because it's sort of a you know that game is played out it's more efficient market versus crypto Collectibles came out so here's a new new version of Collectibles and in this one you could be Jack Butcher and you could make millions and millions of dollars because you understood that crypto Collectibles are going to be a thing or you could have come in at the wrong time or put the wrong percentage in of course you could make money and lose money in any of these but the idea is you have to know what game you're playing if you're playing the game of crypto or investing in gold or investing in art or investing in watches you are not playing the same game as somebody who's investing in cash flowing businesses if you're investing in startups you're not playing the same game as somebody's investing in cash FL businesses so I think the important thing is you have to know which game are you even playing and then what are the rules and topology of that game so for example with Venture investing the mindset is actually I'm going to lose money eight out of 10 times here and then if you go read Warren Buffett you're like oh this guy's the greatest investor of all time let me learn something about that that I can apply to Angel investing and Warren Buffett's first rule is don't lose money his second rule don't forget rule number one if you use Warren Buffett's rule you could never be Peter teal if you use Peter Teal's rules you could never be Waring Buffet right like you know these are they're different games and you you have to know the rules of that game uh in order to play it what I think is interesting is that at different times that at different times each game might have a sort of like hot season there's a there's a there is a uh there are these like Windows where certain games are more ripe or more um more attractive more lucrative to play but my point is you ask why I don't do this type of stuff is I get nervous about many of those games because I believe that for example before startups in the early 1900s there was car companies do you know how many car companies existed in the 1920s and 1930s tons tons most all of them went bankrupt except for like five there was tons of car companies and it was the exact same thing as tech companies today and so I'm weary of those types of games where I I fall a little bit more into the warrant Buffet thing where I'd rather have steady but smaller returns as opposed to Big lumpy jumps I do get big lumpy jumps but I do those in things with things that I can control which is starting and selling companies I just prefer not to do it in things that I don't have control in yeah and to be clear you don't actually play the Warren Buffet game you play the index investing you know basically uh I don't try to make my money on the Investments I try to be sort of safe and conservative with my investments because I'm going to be aggressive and risky with entrepreneurship yeah uh which is not what Warren Buffett does he does he doesn't start companies he buys companies in in full I met Warren Buffett in the sense of um I'll try not to lose money and I will do I'll take a somewhat more conservative approach than many of my peers yes yes yes the startup game is a the startup investing game is a chasing and waiting game which is a very R strange combo you're trying to chase to find these one these breakouts that are going to become the one of the 20 companies that mattered this year not the 2000 that didn't matter and then you have to play a waiting game to let those seeds kind of Bloom over the next uh you know seven to 10 years a month ago you went to Brian Johnson's house so I want to ask you about that or do you want to save it for Friday you can do it let's do it well so Brian Johnson the the the crazy guy who I love who claims he'll or he's trying not to die by decreasing his age you went to his house you interviewed him that's going live soon how was it was there any like Spectacular learnings from him yeah going to house is kind of remarkable um so big house uh not huge but um like nice definitely a nice place um walk in and actually meet his son first so I see his son his son who's on the same on Instagram he's on the same protocol as his dad pretty much yeah rips but he's like 20 like whatever he's like 20 years old or 19 years old or something like that and so he's like I think he's in college or going to college something like that he he's super ripped super kind guy and you know I was like so like what's it like to be you know eating lunch with your friends and you've got the green sludge and they're you know they're eating nachos or whatever and he's like yeah it's cool it's not I don't care you know I'm doing what I want to do it's like you know the the independent mindedness that it takes to live a lifestyle of Brian Johnson you can see like you know from as even just as a parent how that like shapes your kids to be a little bit different and yeah you're like oh you're emotionally healthy you know I he's like I was like what do you think would be great out of this interview with him and he was like you know I hope you clear up like some of the misconceptions like there's a bunch of misconceptions as to why he's doing this and if people understood why he's actually doing this they would feel a lot differently about what he's doing and um and so you know I just I enjoyed that got a tour of his house showed us you show me where he works out how he where he eats he opened up his fridge and literally I was like let's see what's in here he opens up his fridge and there's literally nothing in the fridge there is like there is absolutely nothing there just like one bottle of red wine on the side and he's like and then he's like oh yeah um he like opens up his free he opens up his freezer and there's like some medicine in there I'm like oh what's that for he's like oh that's like this drug that they give to people with leukemia but I just take it proactively I was like okay oh cool um you know you're trying to find Rapport when you go to someone's house and I was like so I wear this Fitbit um I'm cool I'm into tracking too right like yeah I work out sometimes uh I eat sometimes I eat chips uh you know like you know it's like wow it's literally like me meeting a bit of an alien person cuz there his lifestyle and his discipline and his values and his uh priorities are just very very different than mine but also very cool very inspiring he's very a very cool guy so he was um like when you go to someone's house you meet somebody in you're off camera within three minutes you get a Vibe of like what's this person's Vibe some people will give you a hardcore [ __ ] off Vibe some people are kind of like let's get this done you know Vibe and he was totally different he was very kind very curious uh you know want you know it felt like you know respectful uh very very respectful very nice what was he curious about you um well first he was just like thankful he was like oh yeah the first episode we did was a lot of fun one that we had him on a long time ago and he's like that really kind of like you know helped get the word out there got a bunch of good messages from it and that led to more good things so I think the first thing was like kind of like thanks for you know thanks for doing that um that was the first thing the second thing was like you know how do you react to this he's like so I'm curious like what do you think of this and is this something you would do and how can I make this more approachable and like what do you find um you know he was like almost like doing a bit of research in a way to like versus just being a know--it all like I already know the answer I have the answer you guys are all idiots for not following ver you know is having an open mind on on you know what's a normal you know a person who's not in the protocol what's their reaction to this and did he uh have help running around his house like doctors he has he like kind of like number two person she like helps do a bunch of things um but not like it's not like house help that's like his like you know she's like no I meant like nurses oh there was no doctors or nurses there when I was there we went up to like his room where he's got like all the heavy machinery to like measure me your skin and then measure your eyes and measure your ears and all that stuff and I was like I was like so you're really measuring like every organ separately like of course you know skin is the largest organ in your body it needs to be healthy and like you know my eyes are important that's how I see and I'm like well when you say it like that yeah sure um I was like so what's the weak Link and he's like left ear uh or like one of right or left ear I can't remember he's and I was like he's like I have the ear of like a 70-year-old and I go why he goes from shooting he's like you know I used to whatever he's like one ear is down but the other ear is exposed and so he's like when I would shoot that loud uh gunshot that I used to do like you know with some frequency it messed up my ear and it's very hard to rejuvenate or recover an ear and he's like so you know this goddamn thing is is the weak link did you change anything in your life after seeing him I tried his protocol for about 20 days um so I at way yeah so I ate the I told my chef I was like hey this is the new thing I I would like some sludge for lunch and then I want some nutty pudding and um and I tried to buy I didn't do all of his supplements that's the one thing I didn't do cuz to do his supplements you need like 65 things that I couldn't even Source online I was like how the hell did you do this and did you feel good I mean it definitely felt light uh lighter like lighter weight like you can literally feel your body has like less baggage on it you know when you're doing it however I um I really detested that like the main meal the like kind of lentil and green stuff and the one I had the one I when I follow the recipe did not taste like the one he had his house so I think he's got like new versions of the recipe that are better tasting that's so fascinating I'm seeing a lot of people there's a whole subreddit of people saying they're living his life well there's there's a group of people light that are doing this so uh they hold what's called tea parties which is a testosterone party so you it's a bunch of guys they get together they have a tea party where you get tested and you get your testosterone levels and you find out you know do you need to be taken test or what and then that same guy has created a meal delivery service called The Blueprint delivery service which is takes Brian Johnson a meal plan and makes it easy to do because again that's the that's honestly the hardest part of the whole thing is like it's not easy to just do it and there's like it's hard enough to stick to something it's if you add a bunch of friction of making it hard to even do that's that's pretty tough so I think it's great that somebody's doing that I think that's honestly a good business idea because when I met with this guy I was like oh between the first time we talked to you and now he is way more famous and then between now and where he's going to be in like sort of 3 years you could tell this guy is just going to become one of the most well-known people in this world like I think that his story is going to be one of the most well-known people in this world because he is essentially donating his body to science while he's still alive which is like just a crazy thought and he said this during the interview he goes a bet against me is a bet against Ai and I probably wouldn't bet against Ai and I go what AI what do you mean he goes well I've basically handed over my body and the decisions I make for my health to whatever the technology tells me is optimal and so if you think this is not going to work you're basically saying that science and technology is not going to make better decisions than the average human like no way of course it's going to make better decisions and I'm just going to do what the data tells me what the algorithm will tell me to do and he's like longterm that's Ai and he goes a bet against me is a bet against a I and then he the crazy thing by the way and this is in the interview and I don't know how people are going to receive this cuz it's like kind of intense the interview is a bit intense he's like um he's basically like I'm competing with Jesus and he doesn't say that but he keeps comparing himself to Jesus and I'm like that's kind of Blasphemous so what what do you mean and he's like well here's the thing he's like uh I was told because he grew up pretty like a very religious like upbringing he goes I was told do XY Z and then you'll die and then after you die you go to heaven I have a different offer for you do XYZ and don't die he's like that's my whole thing don't die if you're against me you're on team death if if you're with me it's team don't die that's like that's how simple he's boiled it down to and I'm like well you're still going to die like the current thing is you're aging slower but you're still aging and that's where he was like correct that's currently what's happened yeah for now the better the tech gets the better the AI gets the more I'm able to experiment the closer I get to just slowing down the point the the speed of Aging to the point where I'm not going to die one of the takeaways I have is what he has done it's significant but you can do a version of this where you dedicate your life or it's just 6 months to something and like some crazy experiment and talking about it and you could build a career like another example of this this that's way more attainable is you know the carnivore diet is a thing right now only you know be one of these guys that only eats meat for six months that's challenging but it's not that challenging and you could build the career out of that and that is like really interesting so he's he's he's spent a lot of money I think he says he spends two million or a million dollars a year that's out of out of this world for just about everyone but there are other experiments that you can do and it becomes your identity and you can build a career about around that Tim Ferris did that a little bit with the 4our body where he tried things that weren't crazy but he did a really good job of explaining it and making that part of his identity and he built a really great career around it and I think that's really fascinating that's the takeaway I have which is can you dedicate six months to something and talk about it and will that actually change your life for like for the purpose of actually talking about it you know what I mean yeah I think that's totally true and one of the one of the cynical ways to look at Brian Johnson is he just did one of the greatest pre-launch marketing campaigns of all time because now he's rolling out his olive oil and he's launching his like you know blueprint like supplement pack or whatever ability for anybody to follow his protocol simply I don't think that's I don't think that's I don't think that's true at all the guy's way too rich to like become an olive oil salesman you know like I I doubt know he's got $800 million or whatever like you know he sold his last company for $800 million I don't think that he's doing this to launch a new supplement brand I don't think that was his intention at all I genuinely believe that he needed some purpose in his life and he decid he found purpose and meaning in doing this and now he's trying to like just do it at level 12 so he's like cool you know for most people they can they can find some purpose and feel good in exercise or taking care of themselves um he just turned that dial up to level 12 and that's what I see out of him well that's awesome and you you don't want necessarily want to also be at level 12 cuz the wheels start to come off when you're at level 12 and it's pretty intense but it's cool it's very cool that there are people who live at level 12 there's I'm glad that Michael Phelps exists I am glad that Elon Musk exists I am glad that Brian Johnson exists so that you can see what level 12 looks like and then you dial that down to whatever makes sense for you but you can take inspiration you you at least know what level 12 is what I say about those people is I say I know two things are two things for sure I'm I love that they exist and I'm not them right uh that that's what I know um well that's sick um I'm to see the episode and uh I guess we'll end there that's the [Music] pod

all right this morning Sam text me a great idea he goes let's go back through the archive let's find things that we predicted or opin strong opinions that we had at the time and let's bring them back up let's see did we get them right did we get them wrong what did we get right what did we get wrong and what could we learn from it and so we're going to go back Nobody Does this by the way everyone loves to make predictions and have opinions and nobody ever goes back unless they were right well we're going to show you where we were wrong on a bunch of these we did seven or eight of these that um we had a strong opinion couple years ago and now they've played out and we can review how we did and at the end we make two new predictions so two new things that things that have our spidey sense tickling things that feel like they could be big opportunities that we're going to plant our flag and say look I think this is the this is one of the new ones and we'll see in two years if we're right or wrong that's at the end of the episode all right enjoy all right we're live what are you drinking uh this is my secret sauce right now I'm not telling people about this yet water nope you see from the color it's a little different uh green water I just doing some experiments you know I thought um you know we had this we had Derek from more plates more dates on and he was talking about pre-workout right he created gorilla mine that supplement and then we talked about bucked up and they are a pre-workout supplement and basically it's like people take a scoop of something before they go do their workout so that they get a way better pump and it just really like sort of dilates their you know vasil dilation and it gets them to have a better workout I want that for work I want pre-workout for work and so I am uh experimenting with some things that will how do I have like a boost of boost of focus a boost of productivity yeah caffeine I think it's called but that's okay you not caffeine caffeine is for for M morals let me um let me ask you a quick question all right by the way today's episode's going to be exciting so we're going to actually to go over some of the predictions that we've made both right and wrong since the Pod started a lot of these predictions are to come from the 2020 era we're going to look back we're going to call it what did you say the I told you episode I told you so I told you so but it is also going to be I told you we are stupid and we get things wrong as well I Told You So and sorry I told you that because I might have been wrong right but I got but I definitely told you I definitely told you I just want you to take your right hand I want you to put right hand in the air real quick and I want you to reach back and let's give ourselves a little pat on the back here why not because our predictions were so great but because we're actually re revisiting predictions because predictions are one of these things that people love to do they love to people love to spout random opinions about stuff and then they just go they just it just all gets washed away in the noise of social media rarely do people ever go back and when they do go back it's only for one reason when they were right nobody ever goes back and says you know what what nobody asked but hey I just want to tell you I think I was wrong about about that one or I was at least half wrong about that one and uh that's not the code we live by not here not us and so we're going back nobody asked us to do this we're going back and we're revisiting some of the [ __ ] we said and we're trying to figure out were we right were we wrong or something in between and uh we have a a handful of these that we're going to go back and these are like you said two three years ago so they've had time to bake and uh we'll see how they not much time but a little bit of time and the thing about predictions is I was uh you know there's a lot of crazy stuff going on in the world right now and I was curious I was like you know you and I have been having this discussion a little bit off the Pod about like where do you invest your money if you think the world's going to end like part thought exercise part like things are crazy and I was looking at like a lot of really smart people smart money people Bill Amman Ray doio you cited Ray doio you well Ray said this am I reply to you was yeah but he's been wrong about X Y and Z and I had to go and dive deep about where they were wrong cuz if you just read the Wikipedia page you see when they are right like Bill Amman was right about all these things was like oh but he actually lost a ton of money on this thing predictions are challenging uh because not only are they hard to make but the people who get right G get them right a bunch of times are also wrong a ton of times so it's really challenging to know who to listen to It's like a batting average right like you can bat if you bat 300 you know like I don't follow baseball anymore but I think you're like an Allstar and that means you know you're missing two out of three right you are you're you're not hitting on two out of three predictions are way way way worse than that right like if you're predicting correctly on 5 to 10% of your predictions but you're right in a big way meaning you're non-consensus so you're bet you're right about something that a lot of other people are wrong about then you make it big which is one of my one of my favorite quotes I said this on the Chris Williamson pod pessimists get to be right and Optimist get to be rich and so one thing we'll see when we go through these I think is that the times where we said ah it's not going to work those are the ones where we have a higher hit rate right because pessimists naturally get to be right more often however the money is made when you're an optimist about something that other people are pessimistic about or as my father once told me hey even a blind squirrel will find a nut once in a while so I love that by the way speaking of nuts and seeds let me tell you about this first one so a few years ago I was interested in freezing sperm the reason I was interested in freezing sperm is because we don't need to know but okay no listen men's men's's sperm count is going down like a crazy amount remember Ben our old producer Ben had this big thread on Twitter where he was like he documented sperm count and he like made some Jurassic prediction that like in 50 years like very small percentage of men are actually going to be able to uh procreate and this is actually a really big deal and so I've been I've been resear I've been interested in that topic for a minute and so I tried freezing my sperm and I actually re re looked at the episode that we talked about it and the episode was Sam's unboxing of his of his sperm kit or something like that yeah cuz you had it you like held it up dude here's the story I so like you have to like you know you have to like get the sample first of all to do it at a hospital which I also did you have to bring the specimen 30 minutes after capturing it so like if you're not close to a hospital I don't know what you do you go in the room you go in the parking lot I don't know it's like a really weird thing to collect and it's a very shameful thing to hand a special parking area there's a covered parking area you could pull into it's a very shameful thing like when you walk into the doctor and drop the bag it's way have you ever given pee it's like that's kind of shameful giving sperm is is way worse and so I I'm always making excuses I'm like I just didn't have a lot of water today um and they're like we don't need to know I'm like I captured the specimen though yeah it's a very shameful thing to do um and I uh so anyway I tried one of these at home services and I brought it to my office cuz you have to you have to do it and then you have to refrigerator and then you have to mail it in and I like packed it in a box within a box so no one even knew but I didn't have I had to do it at at lunchtime and people in my office were like what's in that what's that in the refrigerator what's this box and I was like oh it's it's just a it's just a thing it's a thing but it says like it says it's like a biohazard or something on there and then eventually someone like was like all right what is this and I'm like it's my sperm and uh they got my employees got really angry at me and they like told HR and I was like I I don't know what you want me to do man I just this is what I had to do so so that's like a funny update but I was using I tried two Services one was called Legacy one was called Daddy D A di at the time Legacy had raised uh $1.5 million and uh the update on them is they've since raised uh a round of 3.5 a round of 15 million a round of 25 million so what's that that's a $45 million they've raised so I presume things are going well with them so the most recent round was in 2022 daddy the company that I talked about at that point it's it's kind of a weird name I don't even like saying that uh they had only raised that out yeah yeah it's weird man so that company has since been acquired they're bought in 2022 for $100 million so that is a thing that we we nailed I think uh and I think you almost had back-to-back episodes cuz you also were talking about uh trt uh we said D Toc trt I think we were like six six letters if you want to make $100 million D to C trt and we were both like that's a great idea and I thought you were going to start that company cuz I was like this is Gen a fantastic idea you researched it and I was like you're kind of Shameless enough to go do that but you didn't do it but you did introduce me to the company that was doing it I think and we both invested in and we both invested and it's doing fantastic a company called hone and um they've gone I mean they're Gang Busters every one of their updates is fantastic so yeah I think I think that was a that was a right prediction I would say and those were both off the beaten path I don't think a whole lot of entrepreneurs were were thinking about capturing the specimen so to speak and uh you were and that it paid off I think I invested at a 10 or $15 million valuation I don't actually I haven't read their updates because I think got sent to my old email if you're listening to this hone update my email but uh I imagine that business is worth nine figures I would think I think it's worth 10 times invested in it um so anyway that's a that that's an interesting one trt and um uh sperm collection yeah that those are those are correct I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of syn spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better let's do one one that was maybe incorrect so we were bullish on I don't know if we were bullish but we were very fascinated on bit clout another thing that we are fascinated is I remember the day you told me about what an nft was when you explained it to me I thought it was awesome you're like I just bought this Kobe thing this Kobe card and I was like all right that's kind of cool and then it things the world went a little B the art for that one was actually amazing which is like it was it was genuinely beautiful to look at whereas like nfts then became like I got this rock I have the squiggle and it was like oh okay you know like you're trying to make a buck only there is no like art aspect to this and I think you paid $500 I think I we paid $700 or something like that and then we flipped it for $10,000 like I don't know 30 days later it was actually credit to Ben so Ben was the one who got us talking to a bunch of nft guys early on and um you know the right move would have been to just go like go crazy on it for a while or invest in the companies behind it but I saw that this artist I really like boss logic was doing one and the Kobe one looked great I bought it and then when I saw a seller it for 10,000 I was like I mean it doesn't look that great like I'll sell it to this guy and I can still look at it whenever I want so I was out of there the other thing we talked about was bit clout so Mar episode 164 March 26 2021 I said I signed up to this thing called bit clout because my friend Ryan Ryan bigelman called me and he said this thing looks cool let's try it um and so we both you and I both signed up for it it was all the rage for a minute so Ryan was on that episode so he he kind of was pitching it he called us before told us to to get on and then he pitched it to us on the episode so what did he say so bit clout by the way it's basically a social it was basically Twitter but there was a crypto component where you could buy into someone's right you don't just follow Sam you basically buy some of the Sam coin and if Sam is going to get more popular other people are going to buy the Sam coin as well because that's how you kind of subscribe or follow the person and so you could kind of we've all had this moment where you see somebody early on you're like oh man this person's awesome they're going to get big and bitcloud was organized such that you could do that and it also had almost like because of that it had a patreon built in it's like oh I already have all these kind of paying shareholders I could just create content just for them only if you own x amount of my coin you get to access this content which is what only fans and then the Twitter blue subscribers and patreon they all do a version of this so it was like aked in from the start versus usually those are third party services and it was a service it was one of the very few crypto things I actually thought was interesting you said uh you said I think you were saying it's interesting because let's do the Ryan one first so Ryan goes I remember when Facebook came to my college and we were one of the first colleges it was really fun this is the first time I felt like that in a long time that's why I wanted to come on the show and then you jumped in you were like yeah two big differences though one you didn't have to have money on Facebook you just you know you just go use it um and two like you're putting money into this thing that we don't know the people behind this we don't know who who how it's working like it's a little nerve nerve-wrecking and you don't and there was no withdraw button at the time you could even withdraw money from it you're like hey red flag money can only go in and it can't come out and then we were like nah don't worry about all that bro like Downer over here and and I said here's my quote I don't know is this a I don't know if this is a scam it kind of scammy to me and then I had found out who's behind it they were Anonymous at the time but I had found out who was behind it by asking around I said I do know the founders they're legit people in the tech scene and they do have a reputation in our circles and they had they had raised I don't know hundreds of millions of dollars from Andre and horrorwitz and others like but and we had the founder on later we had the founder on and then and I said you know and what I liked about it I was like you know today um if I sell on Amazon I keep 70% of of what I of the value I'm creating being a merchant on Amazon if I stream on on on YouTube I'm keeping you know 70% of what I what I um actually not 70% more like it's like a 60/40 split of the of the ad Revenue um twitch is you know roughly 50% then you go down to like Facebook Instagram Twitter and the users at the time captured zero like those were multi multi multi multi-billion dollar companies that the users who created all of the content and consumed all of the content the users did all of the work to create the value of the network we're getting nothing and I said well it does seem like crypto is kind of cool cuz it can it can change that it can basically reward the people who do the work who create the content on the on these networks um and the second thing is we loved the growth hack so what they had done was they took all the popular Twitter people and they just pre-bought a bunch of their coins so when I joined I think there was like $75,000 of value for me to just go claim and I was like hm okay uh push I'll push that button let's see what happens and uh and so they had used the money they raised to buy up popular people's coins and then to to claim your coins you had to be like sign up for your account and tweet out hey I'm verifying my bit clout and that was kind of going viral for a bit and that mechanic worked until it didn't work and bitcloud failed and we know several people personally daresh and a few others that invested millions of publicly into bitcloud and that one and so you know smart people were doing it it was an interesting idea ultimately that idea failed and so I would say you know we were excit I was more excited about it than you for sure um you were like immediately I think we were pretty much out correct well I I I was out but I liked the idea of it the idea of it was actually fairly interesting I like the free money yeah well no like Twitter ended up doing it where they just like gave you money so I get paid I I think $3,000 a year it's on track for $3,000 a year for tweeting and like getting Impressions that's cool but you didn't need the crypto component of it no but that's different you got you get paid a share of AD Revenue me for following you um early on kind of being one of your early early Believers for retweeting your content for all that stuff I couldn't I couldn't benefit from that right but the same outcome for me as as the Creator I get like I feel a little bit more bought in well well no cuz like what was your last Twitter check $50 uh whatever 3,000 divid 12 is $300 maybe something like that $400 maybe so let's say you made $400 bit clout early on when it had I don't know 50,000 users or something like that yeah, my account was worth $750,000 like you know I could have I could have literally pushed the button and cashed that out if I had I cashed out a little bit of it someone bought a bunch from someone's like hey I'll give you ethereum for all this and I was like yours I sold it so some someone the funny thing do you know there's a new one that's basically the same model and it's crushing right now friends in Tech or something friend Tech yeah I'm not on it right now just because I have been busy with other stuff but it's I mean it's generated like 250 million in Revenue as a as a for the project itself and I think it's distributed the equal amount to to uh or people have generated that much on it as well so then it sounds like bit clout well let's do an update on bitcloud but it sounds like we are wrong about bit clout and that it bit clout didn't work the idea did work in friend Tech right I think I would bet that in the long Horizon let's call it 20 years um these networks will be built in with these networks will will do this they will have a currency for the users on the network and so the users will the users who contribute to the network will own and control the the network I do believe that that's going to be true frch I think is like another kind of like attempt I don't think it's probably the one um but I do think over the Long Haul somebody will do that so where's bit clout now um they changed this thing called do I think right the yeah they're doing a bunch of stuff I don't I haven't kept up with it but yeah bit Cloud they were like oh that was just one app on top of the dies protocol and then the dies protocol had like many apps the diamond app and this app um I don't think any the honest truth is I don't think any of it's gotten off the ground in a in a meaningful way all right pick a winner or pick don't don't pick a winner pick an interesting one okay an interesting one okay clout kitchens so um way back we did an episode let me find the I think we were talking about my cookie dealer and a bunch of other uh no you weren't there so I came over to your office to record one day you couldn't make it for whatever reason and you were like oh my buddy Stu who had been kind of listening to some episode steu Iverson uh was there and he was like I'll jump in and he jumped in and he had a bunch of ideas one of the ideas he had was he he goes um you know how Travis colanic has left Uber and he's got this idea of cloud so he's like you know I'm going to create these restaurants that are just built for Uber Eats built for door Dash and they'll be delivery only there's no physical location blah blah blah he goes well there's a better I have another idea clout kitchens and I was like clout kitchen what do you mean he he goes like you know social media guys who have clout you know they have this like you know they have a big influence he's like I think they're going to open up their own restaurant just like you know there's Margaritaville and there's Gordon Ramsay has his restaurants or whatever you're going to see celebrities create their own restaurant Brands uh they're just going to license their name and face to somebody and then fast forward like I don't know a year year and a half Mr Beast Berger comes out and Mr Beast one of the biggest social influencers launches his own virtual restaurant chain exactly as th had predicted and at the beginning it looks great because the launch is insane there's videos of people just like going and trying to to order this stuff and I think it did over a 100 million in sort of grow gross revenue um you know just sort of purchases of uh from from beatburger in year one in year one and so it looked like at the time damn St called it great idea however clout kitchens thing has a couple of issues one is uh you really hard to control quality why why because the way these work are there's just Mom and Pop restaurants and they send the packaging to them they're like hey if an order comes in that's in your area you're going to make a burger just make whatever burer you normally make just try to make a good burger a good cheeseburger but wrap it up in this Beast Burger packaging and put it over here the guy's going to come pick it up and that's how Cloud kitchens work it just gives existing restaurants extra order flow but because of that you have total like no control over quality because you have you know 400 operators each making a different recipe each with a different uh you know sort of quality control around this and at some point Mr Beast was like you dude this is actually bad for my brand people are ordering it's like not not right it's not good whatever I need to distance myself for this and now they're in a lawsuit with each other because they're like nope you signed you signed your rights to to us we're going to keep calling it this and you're hurting our business by saying that and so now he can't really talk about it so that's not a failure I mean it's a failure for him poor execution but it it could work you know it just so happened he was the biggest you know at the time or still is and it got too big too fast that doesn't mean it's a bad a bad concept and I still think if someone's going to do this you could do this you just need to like um have a much more controlled skew so somebody needs to do it with like just like I don't know cookies or they need to do it with a um like they need to do like you know uh what's it called the Edible Eats Edible Arrangements or whatever it's like uh here's a gift you can send somebody it's like you know you need some celebrity who's going to just like create the version of Edible Arrangements on top of door Dash or whatever just like this gifting thing uh that's like can be more consistent so maybe you could just send the final thing to each location I think Reed told us on the Pod when they launched Beast bger he was like me and Jimmy were just like in a bedroom we threw it together in 90 days like he made it sound like pretty ragtag like it was just like oh let's just throw it out there and see what happens I don't I don't know if that's the truth that's the kind of the energy that was implied and uh you know so it just didn't work out for execution reasons but it could still happen um okay here's one that we were uh okay I'll give you two that I was right but pessimistic about so um Clubhouse so I wrote a Twitter thread that was kind of like the thing that blew up my Twitter for a while I wrote a Twitter thread that basically was telling people why like Clubhouse was the hot name at the time it was it went from like nobody was on it to the cool kids are on it to this is you know A2 billion doll company all the course of like a you know less than a year right this thing was just like flying and it was like oh this is the next social network and all the big names were Believers in this thing I remember uh I remember being like I enjoyed being on it but I was like oh this is not going to work for certain reasons and then I would hear really smart people you know Mark Andre invest in this thing Andrew Chen you know the social guy oh he's investing in this thing then you hear nval who's an investor in it and he's like um this will be bigger than Twitter and then uh you know sahill from gumroad I remember listening to him on a clubhouse thing and he's like um Clubhouse will be bigger than Twitter because everybody can speak and not everybody can write and I was like that's not how this works you can't just be like uh my app it's called breathe and everybody breathes so I'm going to be the most valuable company like I was like what is this logic and I wrote This Thread I said hey everybody thinks CL going be the next big thing I think it's going to fail and here's how I think it goes down I wrote This Thread the thread goes viral yeah you had like celebrities reach out isn't that how you met uh hust minhaj and who else yeah I think so uh there was a bunch of people that were like you know I don't want to I don't want to like name drop you know what I mean but like yeah it was it was crazy it was people that I admired yeah it was like your Heroes I don't I mean like like some of these podcast the sports podcast uh guys people who were famous you know authors or or writers or whatever either followed or DM being like that's that was so so good so I was like wow that was great but I also got blocked by a bunch of VCS who were in Mark Andre blocks me they're like you know you know they go from following to blocking like instantaneously why cuz I like you know told them that maybe their investment wouldn't work out and um and I got some hate some people were like oh why you rooting for a startup to fail I didn't say I'm rooting for it I you actually in the thing you said I don't want them to fail I just have experience in this space and it doesn't I don't think it's going to turn out nicely yeah but I think rightfully so people don't believe that where it's like look I wish you the best they say that like when they're fighting like look I wish you good luck and it's like no you don't but I think you know fast forward I don't know when that was I think that was 2021 so fast forward two years now and uh I feel like not just was I right that Clubhouse failed step by step because I was like this is what they're going to do they're going to realize that this doesn't like that they can't grow the thing this way they're going to then launch a recording feature because they're going to say ah you're missing the live show just record it we're going to optimize towards people creating shows versus people just hanging out and they're going to try recording and then no one's going to watch the recordings and then here's what they're going to do they're going to be like we looked at the data and actually yeah people don't watch these recordings cuz the what makes the great live show isn't as good in it isn't a well-edited recording um so then they're going to be like you know who really uses this people who hang out and make friends on this and we're going to switch to a hangout product and sure enough they switched to a hangout product and they did basically each of the steps except for the last one which I predicted was like you know they end up sort of fire selling it to Facebook for you know whatever $70 million and then he becomes a product manager of Facebook like you know that part hasn't hasn't happened yet um but pretty much step by step so that one was was a right but pessimistic and uh you know I guess one takeaway is doesn't really matter to be right when it's pessimistic there nothing really that great comes of it you know you kind of look like an [ __ ] even if you're right yeah exactly I'm like and I'm like oh great now I'm like yeah I told you they would fail it's like oh okay speaking of uh things that you say that you don't really mean did I tell you about that time that a kid flew in from England no what one time when the hustle was getting started this kid called me from England he goes I love the hustle and I was like all right let's talk I start talking to him and we just [ __ ] at the end I go yeah if you're ever in SF just let me know and and we'll help you out and I meant it as like a way to end the conversation and I learned that moment you should never say that I get a message 3 weeks later and he goes hey Sam it's the guy from England um so my flight lands my flight lands tomorrow and he just shows up and and we have hustle con like my big event and we make him work the whole event and we're like here you could sleep on our couch and we dress him up in a Texas outfit he had never been to America before we gave him cowboy boots and a hat that we had in an office and we called him Texas Sam the whole weekend and he stayed with us for like 5 days all because on the phone I was like yeah you know so now I don't say those things anymore if I don't mean it I try not say why that sounds like an amazing experience it sounds awesome well it was only no it could have been it could have been bad lemonade out of lemons situation for you um well it was it it could have been horrible what was the other one you had two was it thasos thaso yeah so thaso was his company that was buying up all the uh buying it was a rollup an aggregator of Amazon Amazon Brands Amazon one of the fastest growing startups ever I think they went from zero to a billion dollars in market cap or valuation in like 12 months and tons of Revenue and then tons of copycats because everyone was like oh thrasio one of the fastest growing startups in the world we're GNA repeat this and um and we had friends who did it too some of our friends went and did the same thing where they bought a bunch of Amazon businesses may they rest in peace uh but it didn't work right that the the problem so you know I I remember calling Andrew Wilkinson and I was like yeah what do you think about the thrasio stuff and I was like I was like I kind of get it cuz you know they're doing uh you know like roll I think rollups in general are just like a a really nice blueprint for a business this rollup kind of makes sense Andrew had done a semi rollup with uh Shopify apps and so I was like do you see this as like you know a really good opportunity what do you think and he goes I think they're picking up pennies in front of a steam roller and I had never heard that before but I guess that's a phrase like a like a Charlie wonger type phrase if Andrew says anything interesting it most likely came from Charlie Munger that's his hero uh and Charlie is like has wonderful phrases so most of the stuff most of the wisdom he has is from Charlie monger and I go what do you mean and he's like it's like picking up pennies in front of a steamroller like you know you're going to pick them up you're picking up these little kind of like what seems like these little cheat free cheap assets and you think it's all going well until you get completely run over and if you fast forward till today that's pretty much exactly what played out these guys bought up a bunch of businesses they rolled up what looked like a lot of Revenue and then they got run over and at the time we did an episode and the things we had said were basically um so I basically took Andrew's point of view and I was like that does feel more right than the other way and I said well what what could be the problems and I was like basically the FBA businesses are not very durable so if you're going to do a rollup you kind of want durability to be one of the highest characteristics like normally in business we think growth is the best thing but actually when you're buying businesses it's more about not being wrong than it is about everything going right and so you want durability when you're rolling these up they bought trash they bought like they would buy like um um one of the Thousand vendors on Amazon selling Chinese dog leashes for $25 you know what I mean like they I think they bought trash so like you know Amazon uh is not durable for many reasons number one uh the r you know like the your your spot in the rankings for these commodity products really matters and like it's a constant battle to keep to to get your ranking to stay high which includes things like people going and leaving fake reviews on your thing so that your account gets taken down like oh let me just spam you with reviews so that Amazon detects you and then delists you right that's [ __ ] like that or copycats or people who pay more or whatever then there's Amazon themselves launching Basics so for every good category Amazon's like cool here's the Amazon basic I know what do you know it's at the top right like that was also happening then there was the last thing that's sort of the death blow which is Andrew at tiny they sort of believe what I think a few other of these like hold code types believe which is that synergies are massively overrated that like it's very easy to talk yourself into we're going to buy these five companies and then Synergy and it's like what Synergy it's like um we're going to centralize the back office and we're going to uh cross promote with each other it's like no actually none of these Brands had enough brand love for you to cross promote anything you nobody trusted you um the synergies in the back office actually just turned into like a bunch of people not really watching what was going on in these individual businesses the way they were when it was just one person owning them so what's the update on them so thrat is basically dead um it's I don't know I don't know exactly what the stage is is it it's fire sale bankruptcy but it's dead and so are all of the aggregators and so now there's like the opposite phenomenon there's like a d loing and which is actually probably a better opportunity to go pick the best 10 assets from all these aggregators who are completely underwater and they just have to you know basically get rid of all these assets and so um yeah tho and all the thio copycats did not work out all right I'll tell you one that we uh I wasn't exactly right and the times that this turned out to be true it didn't play out how I thought it was going to so some something that I talked to you about I think since 2019 2020 was privacy so if you look back on some of our episodes when we were still in the old office so this was 2019 I had this Insight from the founder of Pandora so Pandora is the music service the founder one time told me he was like yeah like Mo many of our users are like middle of America like dentists who like have Pandora playing in the background and what we've noticed about them is they sometimes won't sign up because they don't want to click the link that says they agree to our terms and services and our privacy statements and to me that meant the average Joe cares more about privacy than a lot of people think at the time 2019 privacy wasn't that big of a thing where you you just click yes no matter what I think that that and and so I predicted there's going to be a lot of businesses that are going to be created on top of that another example that I had was duck duck goo duck ducko is a privacy search engine that doesn't like track you in the same way Google does their searches have gone up like crazy and the business has gone on to raise 100 $ million of which most of it I believe was a secondary sale so they're quietly killing it but I thought that this was going to be more popular than it has been it's kind of gotten popular because Tik Tok uh so I think in Minnesota it is or uh Montana it is uh they have banned or trying to ban Tik Tok for privacy reasons they're mostly doing it because they don't like China not because necessarily so this is where I was wrong they're doing it for the Chinese purpose not exactly the Privacy purpose but I thought that this was by now going to be a lot more popular than it is it's slowly growing but we don't care if you give up all your data but you better give it up to an American company yeah you better give it up to us yeah so that has that we didn't I didn't nail that yet I but I'm still I'm still holding out but it I thought by now it would have picked up a little bit but it hasn't so I'm I'm going to give you one that uh we got right and wrong at the same time meaning we did an episode back in 2020 July of 2020 Co has been like raging for 3 months and we do an episode called is gpt3 the next big thing episode number 94 we're like in 500 now this is 94 and we had gotten access to this tool called gpt3 which at the time you had to like get an API key to to you borrow that you to get a friend to get you an invite to get G and it wasn't that good it was okay we were pretty stunned by it mostly because we're 12-year-olds and we like made it write like a rap song in the form of cardi for us and we were like this is hilarious this is amazing it just wrote a rap like this rap is actually good I I said write a rap by cardi B and the title of the rap was walk that plank and it was a very long it was like it had Rhymes as if cardi B was saying it it was very very we were both so impressed and we were like this is amazing and we were we were basically like hey this is super cool uh blah blah and we so we correctly back in July 2020 before chat GB T became the fastest growing product of all time before open AI became a hundred billion doll company before AI was the was the trend we said we released an episode that the title is gpt3 the next big thing answer was yes however I count this as an L why because we just giggled about the rap lyrics and didn't do [ __ ] else we didn't do anything about of it you know the move the the optimal move was drop everything and go work for open AI the second optim move what you said you said in one of the episodes you said if I'm smart I should drop everything and go work in that area and I'm not smart turns out right then I proved to myself that I was not smart I could have there was a hundred ways to make a $100 million with this I could have started a company using gpt3 as the the backbone which the guys from Jasper did they were like oh let's use this to help marketers write blog posts write tweet storms write uh captions write anything that story needs to play out still though though yeah but they built a company that like got to one of the fastest growing companies I've ever seen like getting AR over $50 millionar in one year is like insane and so could have started a company could have gone and worked for open AI could have invested in the open AI spinouts like anthropic which is now a 20 billion company or you know name the go through the list could have um what else could I have done I could have just yeah so between investing starting a company or joining a company there was a lot of different ways to capitalize on that opportunity that we identified but I didn't and I think this has happened you know many times where you sort of like you the opport the elephant in the room is the opportunity and you just sort of like oh that's cool there's an elephant over there versus being like Oh my God wait stop everything I'm doing and let me reassess what I'm doing in order to what's this analogy you kill the elephant are you going to kill theant look look you know how it is with analogies on the Fly sometimes you got to weave two and two together do kill the we got to kill sometimes the elephant needs to strike while the Iron's hot and now you got an elephant that's striking iron right like we don't know the elephants in Rome my friend it's like that Michael Scott that Michael Scott episode of The Office where he's like sometimes I just start a sentence and I have no idea where it's gonna go that's podcasting for you okay so let me preface this I one of the things I like to take pride in is either hiring people before they get like uh before they kind of reach their the the Pinnacle of the career I also like this on the podcast when we find interesting people and we talk about them a lot of times they're still popular but we got them we got them before the curve one of them was Andrew huberman we interviewed Andrew huberman I forget exactly when but when I remember when he interviewed us he was just using his airpod headphones looking at his laptop like it looked like he was in a like a bathroom or something like he like like as if he was like ran to like some room you know he wasn't like a big deal so that one was a cool one so I got somebody here that this is all you so you come on the episode one day and you go you know this guy Brian Johnson and I'm like nah not really you're like you know venmo I'm like yeah of course you're like well it's owned by a company called brain tree you know brain tree I'm like kind vaguely payments company something and you go listen to this guy's story so this guy's story is basically Brian Johnson I'm not going to do his whole life story but like interesting kind of early on door to door sales type of guy ends up creating a tech company brain tree buys venmo sells brain tree to PayPal for like 700 $800 million creates this like neurolink type of thing this brain reader you're like but forget all that I'm like forget all that that was a lot that was amazing you're like forget all of it go to this website blueprint. Brian johnson.com and I go and it's like size six font it looks like I'm reading from a like a textbook and you're like this guy is measuring every part of his body every single organ um he is measuring it and then he is optimizing it he's doing crazy [ __ ] and look at this he's been doing this for like a year and I had never heard of this most people had never heard of this Brian Johnson now I would say like I think he's kind of tipped where like actually in the tech industry everybody knows about him some mainstream people they'll they'll call him the guy who's trying not to die or something like that yeah oh that guy yeah I've seen him he looks weird right like there like the like cuz I bring him up in like every conversation I could find an excuse to cuz he's fascinating and people are like that's C oh I don't I just don't feel like that's going to work right it's like a very polarizing thing but you found this early and you were watching him you were like talking about it then we got him on the Pod earlier and we're about to release new another episode I went to his house we recorded another one but like I feel like you spotted this was your a uber Angel investment right you spotted Brian Johnson way before anybody else was really paying attention to him let me explain the story it's been long enough I can tell the story finally here's how I found out about Brian I I can't name names I have a friend that was going on a first date with this lady he had just met and he goes hey Sam I'm going to take this lady she seems awesome I going to take her on a first date I'm going to take her I have a little plane I want to take her up in the plane and we're going to fly around F1 you know F1 was in Austin we're going to go above the stadium it's going to be an ordeal would you and Sarah like to come on this double date I would love it if you'd come we said yeah sure Sarah gets sick and I text him I go hey man Sarah's not in anymore but I'll still go and so I go I third wheel on this date and we go on this date and she's a lovely woman whatever and she it wasn't trying to be cool but I was trying to Hype up my buddy and I goes hey lady have you uh you ever been in a plane on a first date like this is pretty cool she wasn't trying to damp the mood or you know like rub it in this guy's face but she goes oh yeah you know this other guy used to dated he he liked to fly and we're like huh so we asked a few more questions and we're like what does he fly and she named some jet that's like a 40 billion or $40 million Jet and we're like what and she's and and then she says something like yeah but he likes to fly at himself but he has a staff and we're like who the hell is this guy and so I Google it like who this person is and that's how I find Brian it was she used to date him and that's how I find out about him I just start googling and I come across blueprint that he just launched a few weeks prior and I'm like right this guy's amazing that's how I found Brian Johnson how did that date go though it didn't work ious decision by you to join the date I joined the date dude it's them it's them two in the front two seats and me in the back and I have that head but I'm like putting my hands over the like hey guys like it was so funny I had never been up in a blade like that and I was like I'm passing this up can I still go and I was pipping him up the whole time I was like hey guy have you told lady uh about that one time you did this amazing thing but you're doing it through the plain headset thing which is like you have to yell yeah but I'm still lead enough like hey how about the yeah like did you tell her about the time that you paid for everyone's dinner it was $2,000 Roger yeah I'm like I'm trying to like pimp him up while I'm wearing this headset you're like pointing out like hey we could go there next week yeah was like hey uh guy did you tell uh lady about the time that you had the uh box seats at the F1 and you took all of your friends cuz you're so nice yeah it was like that type of thing it didn't work out though I tried my best guy I'm sorry you know who you are if you're listening to this that's uh that's hilarious you um you had a couple more on here I don't know if you have time but you had a couple more in here that that looked kind of interesting so you had uh do paid communities and then what's this inertia one let's do inertia okay so you this was you you you talk a lot uh that's no surprise but every once in while you say something that's pretty profound one of the profound things that you said it's stuck with me this was in 2021 March of 2021 you had this episode uh where you it's just called inertia I believe and you said um inertia explains like uh inary explains why 90% of people are doing what they're doing in my life I've had moments where I realized inertia is a [ __ ] inertia is the reason why I'm doing these things not be not actually because I want to but because of inertia and often times I've got to check myself and ask myself am I'm really doing the right things and I think that you were referring to a business that you had previously sold where it wasn't doing that well and you're like do I even believe this is a big opportunity would I even be doing this if I weren't already doing it would I've hired these same people would I work with these same people the answer uh at the time was hell no and that's when you decided to get out so my question is he a no question comment that was good that was a really good Insight but question number two you've since sold a business so you started and sold a business I think post this comment yep do you still you like do you still think about inertia all the time and by the way this U this came to about inertia yeah it's like the Roman Empire for some guys for me it's inertia um this happened because I had a come to Jesus moment I uh I was with our buddy suie and we went we used to go in San Francisco if you drive like 30 minutes down uh South out of San Francisco there's these like casinos that are like half casinos yeah so we go down there and uh we're hanging out we're playing we're having a good time at the end of the night he's like um he's like so why are you he's like so I don't get what you're doing and I go like Casino what are you talking about he's like no no no this whole thing you were because I was at Monkey Inferno at the time and to the outside what I was doing was the greatest job ever if anybody had ever seen you've seen our office at Monkey Inferno it was literally the nicest office you have ever been to in your life I called it a Billionaire's playground is what it was and that's what it was he literally built his a billionaire literally built his dream office and we just got to use it there's a chef every day and there's a gym and there's a but it's like for only the 15 people that we were there it was a and you had 20 or 15 you had 20 or 15 Engineers who are paid really nicely and you could just do whatever you want and the job was Sean you get to come up with any IDE you want here's a team of super talented Engineers to build them and designers here's the funding you never have to go raise funding you get paid salary and you own the equity um you can by the way you don't even want to do you don't want to focus on one go ahead do four at a time build four time you have enough resources go ahead do everything right and I'm 25 years old when he 24 years old when he names me CEO and at 24 that was the greatest opportunity the greatest experience ever at 25 incredible opport then I was 29 and I was still doing the same thing except for now the pressure of like succeeding like at the beginning was like dude this is going to be awesome we're going to we have so many shots on goal we're going to do it then we took a lot of shots on goal and we made some good things happen but no big huge win which is what we were all going for and by the end we were really trying to like force a square peg into a round hole it just wasn't working but our mandate was like build the next Twitter build the next Snapchat it's like dude that's really [ __ ] hard to do but like okay we're going to keep trying and so I got this talented team in this beautiful office I'm CEO I'm getting paid well I got Equity I got everything you would want and here's my best friend the guy looked up to saying what the hell are you doing and I was like he's looking at me like I'm a junkie like dude what are you doing with your life and I'm like what are you talking about this is amazing of course this is amazing right and he's like you told me how much money you made back then and I think it was like low six figures like over it was over 100,000 but less than $200,000 and I remember when you told me that I was like making 160 at the time yeah I was like that's the most money of anyone I know like you have $100,000 like that it was huge I remember you told me that M that amount and I was like you're so it was huge to me too I was like this is amazing then and then I was like if any of these ideas hit this is great so he he's talking to me he's just like I feel he's like I feel like you're just doing the same thing over and over again and not getting a result you want and I was like he's he basically asked me a very simple question he's like you know um if you weren't already working on this project if I just took the project away I if tomorrow this whole company had to fold because oh they forgot to pay their bills and whatever this folded tomorrow would you pick up the phone would you call these same people and say hey we're still doing this idea right that's the biggest idea we could possibly think of it's the one we must do would you call these same people to work on the same idea and my answer was yes the same people hell no not the same idea he's like he's and and I was like that's kind of a shitty realization to have it's like I was like am I an idiot and he's like no he's like this is common he's like inertia is a [ __ ] and he's like almost all of us are just doing what we're doing because we were already doing it and like this this even happens with Investments after we got acquired I got a bunch of Amazon stock and so my portfolio was like super skewed towards Amazon I was you know all of a sudden here's millions of dollars of Amazon stock okay if if you had just given me the millions of dollars I wouldn't have put all of it into Amazon only but because it was already there I was like should I sell Amazon I don't know it's a good company right it's like because it was already there my decision was totally different than if I had just Rewritten the the decision from scratch saying if I if I just had this money today is this exactly how I would allocate it it the same thing happens in your portfolio as happens in the time of your life like would I would I allocate my energy and my talents to this project or am I just doing it because I've been doing it if I just doing it because that's what I'm already doing and I think the sad answer is that for most people they're doing what they're doing cuz they're already doing it it's not the thing that if they had a blank slate today they would just go back and recreate this that's the same argument my wife gave to me about selling HubSpot stock I've not sold any and she was like well would you buy this stock anyway my argument was well first of all I I do like the company but do I like it enough to have that much of my portfolio in it I I don't know but my argument is like well but I don't want to pay taxes and frankly I'm not sure if that's a good argument or not um but I I am a victim of it as well yeah yeah of course right there's nuances to some of these things but like that same principle just applies to a lot of parts of your life a lot of people are in relationships they don't want to be in because they're already in the relationship they're in jobs they don't want to be in because they're they're in it and uh and I just kind of had this like it was 2: a.m and I'm in this Chinese casino and my friend is telling me this thing and I remember we drove to our office a badge in at like 2:30 in the morning we go to the Whiteboard and we say we're going to spend the next hour trying to figure out if we can actually make this company work and if at the end of this hour we don't look at a plan on this whiteboard that we feel is like this is going to work like I believe that this is worth a shot then I'm going to sell this company like tomorrow I'm just going to get out of this company and then at the end of that hour we looked at it we were like this is I mean these are all just like random long shots that like we can't sit here and say we have a ton of conviction in and then like the next day I talked to our main investor I said I think it's time to to shake it up like I need to shake up something in my life this is all beautiful this is amazing I can't believe you gave me this experience but like I don't want this anymore Let's either sell the company or you should replace me or something something's got to change I can't unhear what I heard last night and uh I have a lot of flaws but the one good thing I have is that once I hear the truth I just act on it like I just agree that like I've heard the truth now and that's it there's no going back from that uh whereas I think some people will see or hear the truth and then they'll go into denial or they'll delay and I don't do denial or delay that's a good one um yeah I always um I thought that that line inertia is a [ __ ] I I remember that one so I had to bring that one up um maybe the last one is paid communities so I've been interested there's a if you listen closely over the last 550 episodes there's like two to three things that I've like have been obsessed about and I knew I was going to act on one of them I acted on one of them it's a paid community so by the way can you say the two or three what are the what what would be the two or three I I uh helping people find jobs so I call it job boards it's beyond that but I've always been fascinated by that um and then creating um like um somewhat related but I was I've always been fascinated by the trucking industry or other like blue collar essential jobs that aren't don't have a lot of technology or software in order to help them be more efficient um so th those are like two or three things that I've always really liked and then of course B2B media companies and database and research businesses um but the other one that I really loved was paid communities and if you listen closely starting in 2020 I did a lot of breakdowns on different paid communities so I mentioned tiger 21 vistage which uh has since sold so I I talked about vistage a lot of people didn't know what vistage is it's like um similar to what Hampton does similar to YPO does but the target market is uh CEOs and business owners of like plumbing companies uh in the in middle of America doesn't sound that huge but it has since sold for about $1.8 billion I think about 8 or 10 months ago it was doing now it's doing close to $500 million a year in sales very profitable and so I talked about paid communities and I talked about tiger 21 a few other ones here's the I I made a list of pros and cons back in 2020 so this was March 2020 and I'll tell you if I think the pros and cons are true since I'm now run Hampton for about one year so Pros a paid paid communities they can grow quickly they seemed fun to run if you're interested in the topic you don't need a lot of money to start them they definitely seem profitable um and then the cons were a lot of times they don't scale that well I think churn could be pretty pretty high uh and those were like my two main cons so the truth is is that they can grow quickly but you don't want them to grow quick quickly you want them to grow slowly so I was a little bit wrong about that can you start them with zero money zero dollar yes I started Hampton with no money uh we didn't even buy a website or domain name um can they be very profitable yes the answer is yes they can um what I got wrong or didn't mention was how meticulous you have to be about growth and they can get big but they just take longer and that's okay because I think if they take longer usually not always if something takes longer to grow maybe that means that it's going to die it has is less likely to die quickly example thoros grew quickly probably he's going to die very quickly there's a lot of examples of that and so it has in fact proven to be a big business or can be a big business it's harder to grow than I thought but not because of demand but because you don't want it to grow quickly you need it to grow slowly you to be really thoughtful so I underestimated how challenging that is um but I did a lot of the work in front of people I I I would have thought that someone was going to launch this I even interviewed uh the funny thing is the funny thing is you you invited a couple of other paid Community CEOs on the Pod as guests asked them a 100 questions and then took their lunch and I just find that to be an incredible story that I look forward to telling uh as this plays out I I need it to work uh I need to work first at the time you had a community called Club LTV which was an Ecom Community I think it was making $100,000 a month pretty much right away I think you actually that name is wonderful it was uh it was free I didn't charge for it um but it was like invite only like I basically that was I was running an e-commerce business but I'm part-time in it and I've never done e-commerce before and so I have a strategy of like if I'm going to do something that I don't know how to do there are hacks to learn faster one of the hacks is surround yourself with other people who are doing that playing the same game at one to two levels above where you're playing it meaning they're one to Two Notch just better at it than you are and further along than you are and so when we wanted to grow big on on Twitter I think both of us had a similar idea we created a group a text message group called the 100K club and we invited six people who all had that same goal and then we all talked in there about initially like stuff we were doing to make that happen then we all just became friends but like immersion into a small Club of people who play the same or playing the same game at a one or two Notch higher level than you is one of the one of the hacks to get better at something faster and so Club LTV was cool if I just create a curated group of awesome e-commerce owners I'm going to learn a bunch of [ __ ] that I need to know to make my own thing successful so I'm not even charging these people um because I don't need to make money off this I want the information I actually wanted the network from it and that's exactly what I got out of it but you made money through advertising um and you have sponsors and that model actually works so there's a company called Aventa who does this but they did it with like Chief Information officers so these are like Fortune 500 and they were making um they they sold for 17 times profit for $250 million so they're making I think 50 million in revenue and then whatever that profit is I can't do that math um but they s so model that you had it works the downside which I don't think you you knew getting into it logistically there's it's it's a very operationally heavy business it's very very challenging uh it's not Ecom is also operationally heavy but it's more so like there's like three or four things that you have to nail with people there's like way more things there's like people's feelings that you have to like account for and it's a little bit more of an art and it's actually quite challenging to hire uh help for that type of business but you are on to something and I actually think Club that one was a business that could have totally worked uh me and Ben I remember we just had a conversation like hey do we want to actually turn this into a business it can it'll work it would be profitable we just saw better opportunities for ourselves uh but like that's one where if I knew the right person I would have totally just handed over clv CL TV and be like you're the operator of this now uh there's a clear path to make this a business there's like one called e-commerce fuel that's out there that's kind of like the which I love older version of this I was paying subscriber really why why you didn't do I just thought it was awesome uh Andrew the guy who started it I used to read his blog and I thought it was sick it was $300 a year I think he listens to the pot I and I talked to him every once in a while I just thought it was cool I thought e-commerce F was great in fact I was a paying member in Moy Ali this very rich successful guy sorry Moyes I'm going to blow your cover he used to use my account because he didn't want to pay $300 a year to he he would use my we would share a password uh so like it's pretty funny but I lik e-commerce I thought it was great it's still a thing and he limits it to 3,000 people I think right uh something like that I I don't I I don't actually use it cuz it's a forum and I don't really love like forums and there's like Live Events or whatever I I like the way we did it with Club LTV I thought that was more more fun and easier just easier to to like actually participate in um so anyways I thought that uh yeah that that definitely could have been a business uh just you know you got to pick and choose opportunities so long story short uh what what do you think is the what's your takeaway from this so like what do you uh okay we made a BN bunch of predictions we go back we look we see what we were right about what we were wrong about what's your to the Chris Barling question that I love what's the right lesson to learn out of this the right lesson to learn there's a few the number one is we we make money talking about this stuff and that's great you could say we make a great living doing that I feel like a puss for not acting on some of these things I guess I acted on one but like there's been five or 10 or 20 things where you've told me and I'm like that's cool I should go in on that mainly there's only been three things that I've gone in on which is trt but like [ __ ] we talked about open AI like I we should have put our money I think you have in a few cases but I should have put my money where my mouth was a little bit more so that's one lesson which is predictions aren't that easy or aren't that terribly hard Having the courage in them is hard uh mine is the exact same thing which is that the predictions that matter are the ones where you notice something early before everybody notices it but then you like that's you know it it's kind of cliche right ideas are kind of cheap and exuse everything no no the idea is actually quite valuable however it's potential energy you got to turn the potential energy into kinetic energy how do you do that through like motion right so it's like chasing it down and actually doing something with it is um is where all the value gets created and me and Ben have actually figured out a little bit of a better way to do this both through like actually having like vehicles to invest in these things but also we just continually stop and ask ourselves like I think in the last six months there's probably been two or three times where we say what's the thing that we see right now that three four you know three years from now we're going to be like dude we talked about that that was in front of our face why didn't we just go and meet the guy why didn't we go and invest in the thing why didn't we start one whatever it is right and so by asking that question regularly like what's the thing that's actually hidden in plain sight right now for us um I think I'm going to like turn that dial from like uh missing a bunch of these opportunities to taking advantage of them we should do a whole episode on what those things are yeah yeah I will I I'll tell you the way I learned that by the way was I met this guy Anam Myra and Anam Myra came to my office and he was the first product manager at Twitter and I was like tell me what it was like back then he's like well there was like I don't know 12 people in the company uh I join you know 15 people something like that I join and I was like was it obvious at the time that like Twitter was going to become Twitter he's like no no no not at all like Twitter was kind of interesting but looked pretty frivolous and useless people were texting out like what they were eating there was no app at the time it just you just texted this number like 44444 or whatever like whatever you were having for lunch and in silica Valley people were like kind of having fun with it a little bit but it didn't seem like a serious like he's like I had like job offers from Microsoft or whatever like I had serious opportunities and then here was this like Twitter thing even the name sounded frivolous and he's like um but I had learned one important lesson which is that whenever you see like a phenomenon of behavior meaning you see people acting in a way that seems strange weird or inexplicable or irrational the natural reaction is to just ride it off be like I don't know those are weirdos that that makes no sense idiots and move on and he's like what I've learned is now he's a VC and he's like as a VC and as at the time and as like thank God in my career I I realized that which was when you real when you see that weird behavior that you don't understand the thing is not to the thing not to do is label it and write it off it's to lean in and try to understand it he's like so I saw that people were like like why would you text out what you're eating right now like what do you why and why do why do you like to see what other people are saying in that same way like that seems completely like strange Behavior but people are doing it he's like anytime you see strange behavior and people doing it like that's usually the the in that's what a amazing opportunity actually looks like and since he told me that I then saw that many times over like we got acquired by twitch I remember in college walking into my the dorm room the guy next to me who who lived next to me and he was watching a like a replay of someone playing a Starcraft tournament and I was like you are King dork not only is StarCraft on your screen right now you are not even playing you are watching some guy in Korea play this game that is literally like the dorkiest dumbest thing I didn't and I literally made fun of him for it for like a year later when we got Acquired and he's like oh you're head of Esports at twitch now he was like uh he literally was like you [ __ ] he called me and he was like you used to make fun of me for this and I was like dude I agree I was totally dumb and wrong I should have way I I don't even play games but I watch people on YouTube playing yeah and I was like I should have leaned in why would somebody do this behavior that seems completely irrational why would somebody watch someone else play video games on the other side of the earth through this Replay that he had to download at the time there was no twitch at the time it's like he had to download this thing off the server for eight hours and then watch it at night and I was like weird I don't want to hear it and then of course you know so missing that five times has taught me like lean into that like and I just remember the open a example by the way Sam Alman president of YC right he is he had the best job in Silicon Valley president of YC was the best job of Sil in Silicon Valley at the time YC is probably the most like value generative company at the time uh or like organization he's the president he got picked over anybody else and he left to go join an AI nonprofit I like what yeah like something something's up these billionaires are putting H hundred million dollars into this AI research company this nonprofit why would they do that and again I was just like weird Sam doing a weird inexplicable thing instead I should have been like hey the smartest guy in Silicon Valley just left the most prestigious job in Silicon Valley to do this thing that sounds sort of like strange to me lean in and uh yeah that's the lesson I would share at my takeaway of this whole thing let me wrap up with one quick thing I forgot I should have said this earlier but we did this episode about this guy I think he was in India and we called him in and he like talked to us without his video on and I found him because he had this website called Uber Pro I think it was called Uber dopro and I've Googled his name I Googled his name last night I can't find him anywhere online oh he's gone I can't find him anywhere and if anyone can find him please do this this would be amazing I want to see what he's up to now he was 23 years old or even younger and what I did was I gave him $1,000 and he gave me $10,000 in Uber credit and for like years I took an Uber black everywhere because what he did was I think this is how it worked what he did was he found all of these Indian kids that were like in his town and when you rode Uber for the very first time and you referred people you got $25 in free credit and somehow he made it so he could convince all these kids to take a free Uber to get $25 in credit and to continually refer themselves I also think he ranked really high on Google for Uber discount code or Uber promo code and so he accumulated millions of dollars of uber credit and you could buy the Uber credit from him for 10 cents or 20 cents on the dollar and I found this website and I was like I'm doing this and I bought I think $1,000 worth of uber credit and I and then you have to change your iPhone from America to malova your Uber account has to be in malova and that was this loophole and he was making a lot of money doing it for an Indian a guy in India he was making thousands of dollars a month which I think in the pot he's like yeah this is so much money I think he was making 30 grand a month and I always I've always wondered what is that kid up to I wanted to know where I remember having him on he was fascinating he was he was fascinated that was a great Arbitrage that the guy uh you know had architected for himself very I don't know if it's illegal but definitely against the rules questionably unethical but when you see things like that they're going somewhere and I've always wanted to know what happened to that guy I want to leave you with two of the kind of you know I talked about like why am I hearing about this three times don't just ignore this like I'm training my brain to not ignore these signals now I'll give you two of them for people who made it this far in the episode These are the gem this is the gem now uh this is the part where you're like holy [ __ ] I can't believe they saved this for the end which is basically the two trends that I see right now that are strangely big go to go to character. and pull up how much traffic you see that that website has oh my God I would have thought like 10,000 a month and what's the real number oh my God so 200 million exactly 200 million what this like you could go to the Wall Street Journal it won't have 200 million you could go to New York Times it's not gonna have 200 million this is no no media site has that and it has an average visit duration of 33 minutes it's beta. character. okay so I've been on this talking about I've been talking about Ai and I've been talking about like only fans and this like kind of sometimes the crossover between Ai and like this like AI only fans thing and I'm looking at investment opportunities in the space there are so many companies that are doing this like chat with a AI type of thing replica character AI whatever and they never thought that would be a thing they all have ludicrous traffic we called it by the way we talked about replica like a year ago um girlfriends a i virtual girlfriends exactly and that's a lot that's a lot of how people use this character AI thing like they kind of chat with uh the chat I think goes into the gray area a little bit um I mean it's a lot of like smart people like Einstein but but the the top person is Ariana Grande and Billy ish and then like some K-pop lady like there's that probably a a weird people being willing to chat with AI for a really long time so easy to write off as weird loser but it's it's my friend watching Starcraft tournaments in the room next door right dork King dork Behavior I will not make that mistake again this is this is definitely something I don't think that these companies necessarily are the winners but like you know every every product there's kind of like the wave one of attempts wave two of attempts wave three and then finally there's like the last mover right the the last mover who actually Nails it and builds a full-on product around this and so there's something in this space that's like ranges from companionship to um naughty chat that like with AI that's going to be massive because the numbers are off the charts the behavior of this strange thing is off the charts okay that's one second one which is less crazy is um there's a bunch of really smart people that are now have a new business strategy and their business strategy is to buy wounded unicorns and so heard it once heard it twice heard it three times first heard this from Andrew Wilkinson Andrew Wilkinson he he called me back a couple years ago I was living in my old house San Francisco and he I remember him telling me you know what I would do if I was you is I would find one of these uh startups that's raised Venture Capital but is not going to become a billion- dollar company but they got to 5 million in Revenue 10 million in revenue and you could buy these for cheap because they don't have a they can't raise their next round and there's no way out and so there's not really like a a good exit market for that group and those people don't want to like fire a bunch of the engineers stop paying high prices for their San Francisco office space and like become profitable they could in theory but they're just not going to eat [ __ ] in order to do that they're just going to shut it down return investor money sell the assets to whoever and they're going to go start their next company or go get a job he told me that first he had then done that with a company called meteor so medier was his developer framework and I think he bought a company that was doing like five to seven million it was doing like 5 million plus in revenue for like one ex revenue or I don't know it was like some like ignore the multiple the exact multiple I think I think they raised $30 million or something like that they had raised a bunch of money it had customers it had Revenue but it just wasn't going to be the next big thing which is venture capital is called become the next big thing or bust and what he realized was if they bust we can pick some of these assets up so Andrew had said it then um you hear other people that are talking about this that are doing this our friends Xavier and sea they're doing this right now if you're driving to San Francisco there is a billboard with with their company that says like whatever like there's never too late for a second chance or something it looks like honestly it looks like a divorce lawyer cuz it's KJ with her arms crossed and it says like um you know there's always uh you know there's always a second chance or something like that and I don't know what the Billard say they literally have a billboard entering San Francis you know like when you come in on whatever the 101 it's like um uh it's right there and it's basically saying you know like don't just shut down your company sell it to us so they're doing this Jeremy gfin is like he came on invest like the best and he was like yeah I think one of the big opportunities right now is to do this you hear this for five times from smart people like you got to be an idiot to not realize that there's probably something there and it's like it's not you're hearing it from the news like you got to know where you're hearing it from you're not hearing it from the news or like the hype cycle type of things it's like you hear smart people mention these things in kind of passing or these opportunities but it's not consensus yet and you realize like oh that's probably one of these like what I call like you know value spots or fat pitches so like what are the big fat pitches that you could go swing at you don't have to go swing at it but like you should identify that at any given time there's like a couple of fat pitch opportunities that you could be going for that's one of them I want to learn more about it I want to how do you find I mean I want to know I've got questions like how do you find them just run bro don't don't even don't even think about it just keep running hampon you already got your fat pitch well um by the way love saying fat pitch by the way just a fun fun phrase to say yeah I agree uh it's a good one it's a good one where'd you steal that from T Teddy Williams Warren Buffett who stole it from Ted Williams who knows I know he said it in his biography I know hard to say no I said it very easily um all right that's the [Music] pod

I remember the first time that I hit a million views overnight it was a that's cringe video I remember like we did a couple and they seem to be working people seem to be into them but it wasn't like apparent how much more people liked them than you know the other stuff that I was doing then we posted like the third or fourth one and I remember waking up to a million views and I was like oh my God that is unfathomable for me even 5 months ago when me and Noel went on tour for the first time and the tickets would just sell out that was a moment where I was like I can't believe that this is now converting into Real World Sales where people want to come to a venue and see us in person that felt really cool that's always like a weirdly sobering thing

whenever I hear stuff like this like when people are like you know oh you know money doesn't make you that happy or like you know after this amount doesn't really do anything for you it's like yeah you're probably right but I'm just G to check yeah I would like to find out I'd like to find out I'm I'm gonna go ahead and test for myself [Music] yeah all right we're live um can I start the podcast doing something that you're going to dislike can I complain I want to complain oh everybody wants that I'm having a really shitty week and I'm having a horrible day so basically like uh personal life there's some stuff like we thought the pregnancy was going to be one day or the due date was going to be one day now it might be another day I don't have the supplies I need so I got to go and buy the crap this weekend that I think I need I'm really stressed about that at Hampton we uh are dealing with like we're having to make like uh policies that I've not used to having to make like maternity leave and things like that so those conversations are exhausting to me and then um I got sick this week and I took this medicine that made me bloated I don't know if you could tell by my face but I've gained 15 pounds in the last three days I feel like you need to poke me with like a needle and I need to like let out air I feel miserable my all my fitness gains that I've made in 3 years it feels completely erased rank those from worst to least worst the bloat is the number one worst right it has to be but listen I have a worst thing listen to this you'll find this hilarious I did David Pell's podcast he asked me to look at his edits I log in let me read to you the first edit that he made to his editor that I read it he said this is a note from David he goes hey can you remove the I love Nazis part it's a little distracting clean it up basically on the podcast he was like what do you like to read lately I was like oh you know I've been loving like history I've been loving War War uh in particular I love Nazis like I like reading about that and I just log in and I'm like remove the I love Nazis part and so anyway I've had a hell of a day dude I feel bad and it's like 11: a.m. am I being am I soft right now or is or should we just pull the plug on on everything millionaire has uh gas or whatever by the way really funny we uh we were at a dinner uh with these guys who like these other founder investor type guys and then somebody was like oh do you want this and Ben goes no I'm okay they're like what you don't like this he goes no I just I feel bloated and then the whole table turned and looked at him and were like are you a pregnant woman why are you saying you feel bloated and I was like I never heard a guy say I feel bloated I'm not saying it doesn't happen but I am saying you should never say it it's just it's the what what was your list of like drinking from a straw holding yeah men don't drink from straws don't hold saying bloated is is now on that official list of of never do it it makes you look super soft men do not drink from straws men should never hold mugs or cups with two hands that's a rule you don't do that another rule that I'm thinking about making is if you get a drink and there's a lid on it you always take the lid off and and for sure for sure men do not say bloated uh yeah we could add that to the list added to the list all right good good we got that settled um okay so besides your your petty complaints um where do you want to start what do you got so you have Facebook are you talking about the uh Lex Mark interview Mark yeah so I see this thing so so Lex Freeman does this interview with Mark Zuckerberg and here's the setup about it like I don't know when Facebook rebranded to meta but I think it was like two years ago uh or a year and a half ago and um Chang the name meta people are like okay why and he's like because the metaverse and the metaverse might be get on that bloated list as like words you should just never say it's like if I was like hey guys I'm logging into the information Super Highway real quick it's like you know how they used to call the internet that like back in the 9s that's what they called the internet so so you know the metaverse was always this dorky thing and you know the problem with it was like people were like oh okay it must be it's is it awesome is there something awesome I don't know about and then they're like so what what is it Mark and he's likewell it's um digital identities and avatars and and they're like oh we're laring now we're not what are we talking about here and so then the demo so Ari can you pull this up pull up the initial demo where he was like the future of work check it out Facebook Horizons whatever and he pulls up this that's me this goofy Avatar of Sam par if you're on YouTube right now so it's this absolute cartoon like The Sims version of Mark Zuckerberg standing in front of a tiny Eiffel Tower which makes no sense and they were like yeah like you don't need to do business meetings on Zoom anymore you could do this and everyone's like I'll never do that and so you know it's Facebook meta stock price tanks people are like he's wasting all this money on the metaverse he's uh you know this guy's clueless and stock tanks but I I was believed as you know we are we are pro Zuck on this podcast hard to bet he's hard to bet against so bet against I start buying the stock I'm like I'm like that guy who liked the GameStop you know stock and he's I like the stock I like the stock by the way did you see the movie that came out or the show that came out about that on Netflix I'm gonna watch it yeah I'm watching it for sure it's it's pretty good I would say I give it like a it's a solid B+ it's like a for guys it's entertaining we're gonna we're going to make that the official rating of dab we're going to call it dab DEC at best that's our new rating it's dab how is that it's dab yes exactly so so anyways um we like the stock we buy it because we believe that this guy is not going to go all in and lose now fast forward about a year in one year here's what the metaverse looks like now he goes on Lex Freedom's podcast it looks like him and Lex are talking to each other but they're actually whatever thousands of miles apart doing this podcast they're wearing the new like Quest device or whatever and check this out so this is unbelievably realistic like it looks identical to their face um the freckles on their nose the lighting the the the mouth movements while they're talking like it's super super realistic which is funny cuz like both of these guys barely move their mouth actually so it actually looks a little stiff but it's because Lex Freedman and Mark Zuckerberg areff the stiffest guys on the planet so you know the guys who like don't show emotion so it wasn't really that good of a demo in that sense but kind of amazing now it had like a black backdrop like there was no they don't have the background stuff built yet but yeah so explain how that works so basically what I'm seeing is Lex and Mark are wearing what looks like an Oculus but slightly different but basically an Oculus and then are there cameras outside of the that's it wow that's it so they're wearing this headset and what what happened is they both did this scanning process so right now it's not like the sustainable thing but like that that purple image is the 3D codec scan basically so they went and got this like scan done which today like kind of the manual process to do this but in the future the device itself or your phone will be able to do this scan for you you'll just it's like a Xbox has a thing called connect I think it works the same way where it's basically like you stand in front of it one time you look to the left you look to the right you look up you say these 10 sentences you move your hands around and it's like cool I've now recreated you perfectly digitally from now on um and by the way this is going to be like the DMV also because what ends up happening is whatever you look look like when you got scanned that's you online now and so like I could be sitting there hair disheveled having shower beard on my face but if my avatar is When I Look to my best that's how everybody will see me in my meetings and on the podcast or whatever it's like when you die and go to heaven what do you imagine someone to look like you know like which a which age are they for eternity that's sort of like this you know what I mean I feel like it should be like whatever you remember them by that's what you see and so you know that that that be that'd be my My Hope but they so right now they're doing this 3D scan they create this Advanced model that's the thing like why is this not release to everybody because they have to figure out how to do that scan just like on a phone uh so that anybody could do it but after that the thing was incredible and I just think the progress in one year from that cartoon that's awesome Cartoon Avatar in front of the Eiffel Tower to this is unbelievable and now this when you see this you're like oh okay I kind of get this metaverse thing like uh this is cool like they were hanging out in a room they could play ping pong together they could do an interview together without ever having to travel without ever having to leave their space that is pretty impressive dude what do you think about Mark Zuckerberg's patience when everyone was like nerd like what are you doing dude this is the stupidest thing ever and like he knew how amazing this was going to be dude I just imagine like the Arthur fist he just like clenches his Arthur Fist and that's his only like Outlet of emotion and he's like continue nothing nothing he just has he he just like walks around with a notebook and like he'll just like cross a name off a list every once in a while of like Revenge got him or you'll just see someone like high school Crush that it's the Winkle boss Twins and now the list is just super long like someone will like insult him in an interview like hold that thought and pull up his notebook and just you see him not and put Sean with two A's or okay no no no Mark I like the stock I like the stock dude he's totally pulled us off we always have said this but imagine this like a guy who's been the top of the game since he was 20 years old married to the same woman the entire time has a happy family has Hobbies has never had a major scandal at least nothing involving his personality super ripped uh don't forget super ripped fit seems pretty nice this guy's awesome man by the way you just described LeBron James also exact exact description of LeBron James also they are the same they both were big shots at the age of 20 they're both ripped to certain degrees or different degrees um they both have never had major is LeBron LeBron's been with us his like high school girlfriend forever right they're married Savannah yeah and and he has a bunch of kids uh and like family it seems like I saw LeBron at the wi Casino one time and I was like LeBron and then I go up to him and I try to DAP him up and like his security was they were there but like he was walking so it was like I wasn't bothering I was it was clear I was being quick I got off the blackjack table to just do it and uh when I tell you that my hand was a tiny Pebble in this man's giant hand I have never felt so honestly so supported I felt so like taken care of when I just put my hand in this guy's giant mitt it was unbelievable to see a human hand just wrap my my whole hand up yeah women aren't the only people who like to be hugged and like everybody needs a Big's food and I found mine it's LeBron James all right have you heard dude wait have you seen this thing Zozo fit z z fi T oh was this the like motion capture thing it's it's a it's a suit this guy in J Japan came out with this thing I've been like paying attention to this for 10 years it has never lived up to its hype I've been about this forever but it's a suit that they sent to you it's a bodysuit you put it on and they claim that it like knows all the dimensions of your body and then you could buy clothing that like fits perfect to it it doesn't work things that Sam's been telling me about for seven years denim Brad Adcock and zozofit I love Zozo fit man I've wanted it to work because I've got huge thighs and a fat ass and so finding pants finding pants for me weirds but okay it's just it is what it is just well explain this guy so this guy is a Japanese billionaire right like he's like a he's a Japanese billionaire he came up with like a media company that's originally I think how I found him I think it was the media company and then his new thing was he's going to start this clothing company and he's going to mail everyone a Zozo suit for free per fit right the perfect fitting clothing turns out I think the clothing company like didn't even do that well but people are like yeah can I just get this Zozo fit thing and just use it for everything also to like tell me if my muscles are getting bigger or if I'm losing weight like tell me about it all and so he just says all right fine it's a 50 bucks like it's going to be really cheap and you use your phone it's like um when you see like the Lord of the Rings movies being made and they're wearing these weird suits with these balls on them it's basically that it's a suit like that way and you like somebody should be making this for with just AI now so um you know like calorie counting apps have been around forever yeah and you used to have to manual you know you'd be like okay it's lunch and you'd open My Fitness Pal or whatever and you'd be like I've been using my fitness pal every day for years and you would um you'd be like yeah I had a chicken salad they're like how many ounces of chickens like I don't know dude I didn't weigh it uh 8 ounces they're like cool like light dressing or medium it's like I don't know sounds like a personal question what are you asking me about like and so you you had to manually input all this well now there's these apps like Snap calorie and stuff like that you just take a picture of the thing and it's like good enough now where it can actually guess the calories um and and I I would say like it's still not all the way there because it doesn't know let's say like how much oil was used in cooking this for example but that we're getting to that point where you can just take a picture and it knows the calorie count well I think we're also going to get to the point where if I'm on some Ecom site and I'm like am I a large or a medium I don't really know I'm going to be able to click a button it's going to turn turn on my camera and it's just going to scan my body and be like you're an extra large I hate to break it to you and like you know that's what's gonna happen here you're 61 like 200 pounds you don't wear mediums in the metaverse occup be any size I want Sam all right I might be a small to medium I may be a medium um but you get what I'm saying like I think that this is all going to become like oh your phone can just do that now you don't need to wear this haptic bodysuit from zozofit like that's where this is definitely going if I was like a really smart team that was like good with like computer vision and that sort of thing I would do something like this because it might not even work for the first year but like two years from now it should be able to work really well and then that is a thing you could sell to every Ecom site in the world because every Ecom site wants lower returns every every apparel every fashion brand wants lower Returns the way they can do that is by getting the perfect fit for people what's uh do you want to talk about rewind or the CL clavio thing yeah one last thing on the Facebook thing I think but here's my random prediction in 10 to 15 years Facebook is going to be Facebook the like meta is going to own the largest work platform so I think that they're going to be the the zoom the whatever because this experience where it looks like you could feel like you're in the same room as a person and you can pull up you know PowerPoints together you can do all that stuff without like video conferencing I think that's uh whoever does that right is going to take over the the the work called space and I don't see who could do it better than Facebook at this point because they have such a lead as far as the tech goes so I think we'll look back we'll tell our kids yeah Facebook back in the day used to be about sharing uh you know photos of your of yourself at parties from college and they'll be like what the thing I use for work every day it's like yeah that's that's the difference I think 10 years it's going to be like that I have some cash sitting sitting around that I was going to use to pay taxes should I just uh hold that for you yeah should should should beg Zuckerberg uh uh keep an eye on my money for me exactly you're holding his money uh all right so now rewind so did you see this uh thing that came out it was pretty controversial the there's a guy or there's two companies I came out with this at the same day which is uh we'll just say rewind because that's like the one I remember the name of um it's this pendant you wear so it's like a necklace um it's like you know the Angelina Jolie necklace where that she like was wearing the blood of like a a small child in Africa or something yeah I don't know what was going on but like it was it was worse it was Billy Bob th it was what what's like the blood is the blood of Billy Bob Thorton just like motor oil just sweat so so there's this pendant that you wear now that basically I don't know if you saw this but it can while you're wearing it's just going to record everything everything you say everything that's said to you it's going to automatically transcribe that and then save it locally on your phone so that if you're ever wondering like what did that person say or what did my wife asked for groceries or did that person incriminate themselves you can now have that all transcribed and stored for you on your phone and some people are like did that guy reveal where the bodies are or not we found out if Adan s killed that girl or not you know he he wore the rewind pendant he was an early adopter so there's this so a bunch of people were dunking on him on Twitter I think he tweeted out like I don't know 1,700 people bought the thing on day one which is not that much like it's like you know maybe that's uh what is it 1,700 it's like 60 bucks uh a thing 100 Grand of Revenue on day one not that good they one of his thing not that good um and people the tweet that went viral was like oh so we're just gonna we're just going to be wearing a wire now like that's what's up just going to walk around we're going to voluntarily just wear wire great tweet I got to say at the same time the answer is yeah yeah you know what you also carry around a GPS tracker with your location at all times that also has a microphone on it you know what you also do you have a a camera device on you when you're in the bathroom taking a [ __ ] or taking a shower like we already have given up privacy everywhere and uh the the the the line I used in my newsletter I was like um you know privacy is like vegetables and we give it up we we'll happily give it up for just the promise of a moment of pleasure or convenience well that because because that's the junk food and like we just go for the junk food that's the reality of the situation is very few people will opt for vegetables when they have the option for junk food and if this is Tech that can either save you time give you entertainment uh you know like allow you to to be lazier in some way people are going to do that I remember my family like I had some family members that were like oh this vaccine is just for Bill Gates to track US and I'm like hey Uncle Ron listen he already tracks you like he already knows I track you with find my I find my friends I know where you went all day today you shared your you shared your location with me like he yeah like remember that 23 me thing where we send in our blood like it's already being tracked okay like you're already Bill Mr Gates already has everything he needs so he doesn't need to do this um Hey Ron you deleted your cookies anytime recently yeah forgot to delete my cookies yeah so like Bill Gates he has what he needs uh I will not be wearing this thing rewind I don't wear any wearables because I don't want to be I want to be tracked less and this [ __ ] just stresses me out that's surprising to me because I feel like you've done all of the like blood testing age testing inject inject random chemicals that some dude on Reddit said uh you know helped him feel stronger inject that in your butt like on on one hand you're willing I'm drug free at the moment well at the moment is the key phrase there so by the way it feels way less good by the way hate it yeah it sucks why are you resistant to some of these trackers but then on other in other cases you're very into measurement and whatnot uh one I am kind of like going to the like more pure where it's like less is more I don't want I don't want drugs I don't want my cell phone I like when I go out most of the times I don't bring a phone um so I don't like having my phone on me yeah like when I go out I won't bring a phone I have a Tesla so I could use the directions on my uh on my car and so like if I go like I went have to eat last night I don't bring a phone what is that weird yeah that's very weird I I don't I I won't bring it so I I just don't bring what happens if you need to text someone or what happens if somebody calls you what happens if uh you get bored for three seconds and you need entertainment what do you do yeah I I don't I I I just don't bring a phone most places I don't bring a phone so like if I'm going out on the day for the day on Saturday I won't have up my phone with me um okay Mr I'm better than everybody so you're saying about mental illness what were you saying no I uh yeah so I I just I've gone from like so I used to have a whoop I had an Apple Watch I the only trackable thing I use is eight sleep and I only use that because it makes my bed cold but I don't even like track any of that so I don't track anything I do do the blood work stuff because that's just a fun hobby but uh uh I don't yeah my hobby is like pain I like getting poent needles um but yeah I don't do any of that stuff do you track yourself like do you I I I like whoop I just don't want to track any of that [ __ ] I don't care I'm not I'm not a huge tracker I actually just bought this Ur ring because I uh I wanted to test my before getting the the surgery for my devv septum and after I wanted to see if my sleep improved or not but normally I'm not a big tracker but yeah I do take my phone please uh yeah no I don't track any of that stuff so I'm not going to be buying this thing are you um I'm not going to buy this thing but I do if again it's sort of inevitable like I think if you just track forward in the future we're gonna have de we're going to wear a device on us that's a camera and a uh and a microphone and we're just gonna like which actually brings me to the second Facebook announcement did you see the glasses that they that they had the the new Rayband things so I had V1 of this and I've had the spectacles I've had this none of them have quite stuck yet but it is kind of amazing it is kind of amazing the demo is really cool he's like watch this like I can basically live stream you know just handsfree like if I'm at something cool or whatever I want to share this on my Instagram or share this with my friends I can just uh push this button on my glasses and it's a camera that's going to capture this or if I'm at the park like this is a big one for me I'm at the park with my kids there's so many of these Great Moments and just literally it sounds stupid it sounds like Petty but like the time it takes to like get your phone out of your pocket unlock your phone get to the camera app and do it the moment is gone and so um I had these things that the these rayb bands that Facebook made that like you know while I'm working out or while I'm with my kids at the park or whatever I can just quickly just like record anything on the flly and it just grabs the next 15 seconds it saves it to my phone personally and then if I wanted to share that I could um and the video turns out really cool it's like first person view so I definitely am excited about this I think this is another like one of these breakthroughs I'm waiting for I'm actually less interested in the like glasses that like show your email to your eyeballs I don't really care so much about that but a camera that's an always on camera um I think is really cool to be able to share Cool moments of course there's like the privacy concerns or whatever but I think it's going to happen and uh is it weird that I I trust I kind of trust Facebook privacy wise is that do you well you know what it is it's kind of like that family member that like actually has like you know they've done some [ __ ] but they're like I've known them for 32 years now like you know like I guess I just kind of default to them you know like at the end of the day if I'm leaving my keys with somebody it's the one I've known for 30 years versus you know even though they they've gotten into some some sticky spots but like I feel like it's a known Evil versus an unknown evil in that sense yeah I kind of trust him for some reason I I definitely trust them um by the way people in the comments going to hate this because there's still a huge population of people that are like hate Zuck hate Facebook and hate that we we love we we say we trust Facebook that's like Blasphemous to a lot of people anyways let's move on I don't care all right listen so uh here let me tell let me bring up this topic and I want to hear about your experience with this so two companies went public in the last couple weeks you probably big fans of both of them I think you're more fans of one of them what's it called clavio clavio clavio yeah I how you say it I call it clavio I think it's clavio so clavio it's sort of like uh it does everything it's email software but mostly for Shopify folks right e-commerce yeah so if you want to send emails you know oh you know your order is confirmed or or things like after somebody comes to my site and I grab their email address email them every day until they purchase for the rest of their life you know that sort of thing so they went public let me see what their market cap is today they went public right now their market cap is eight or n billion the founder when it went public he owned roughly 40% of the company still wow which is amazing um another company went public this guy um started what's the guy's name started instacart you know I bet you've had run with Indian guy Aura I think he uh seems like a great guy went public he only owned 10% about about of the business um and what's crazy is I tell people that I tell people that your cap table I think is the one thing in your company that is irreversible for mistakes besides that most every mistake that you make most mistakes at all most mistakes you can reverse or you can fix cap table the one thing you can't fix and what's crazy is when I was starting um a few of my companies I remember like wanting to raise money and I'm like oh what's 10% here what's 10% there I'll just make my employee pool you know what most people only make it 10% we're going to make it 18% we're going to go big if we if I if the company succeeds everyone should succeed like I would do these like I was really Loosey Goosey with equity and that's one of those things now where I look at people it's like when people tell me like oh you got to sign this NDA before I tell you my idea it's like oh that's silly I'm not that that just shows me proof you don't know what you're doing right but with with Equity it's actually one of the very few things that's really really important and so the difference between these two um these two cap tables the difference between 10% and 40% we're talking like5 billion um which is just a huge I don't know if it like how much of that is it's a mistake versus one is a capital intensive startup and one is software that's not as capital intensive well both I think both so instacart is I guess that would be Capital intensive maybe I actually don't know where that would be maybe maybe Middle Ground of capital intensive whereas clavio you actually could argue it's also middle because you have to hire lots of Engineers but maybe not um but my point being is I actually think that people are too willy-nilly with their Equity early on right and I made that mistake at my first company uh and it's a horrible horrible mistake one that you cannot recover from and there's so many examples I know a guy who sold this company for three billion or sorry for $1 billion he sold it for $99 $980 million he made3 million bucks from it um I swear to God it was because he's like we had four co-founders we got we raised a lot of money I gave so much Equity to employees it was insane he's like I lost my share certificates I just don't know where to put them like what's happening how's that possible um have you heard the story of how uh instacart got into YC no oh is that where they went and bought literally every grocery ever at Trader Joe's no I think that might be a different story that's also probably a good one but basically the story is like they uh I think they were exp like they were trying to apply late and um and basically they were like you know we they they were trying to get introduction all the YC Partners were like no sorry it's too late to to get this batch you get to the next one um Gary tan who's now the current president of YC was like you know you could submit a late application but it'll be nearly impossible to get you in and they're like so you're saying there's a chance like they they read nearly impossible as possible yeah right because technically it's true and um then they put together the application they get the reply the next day no and so they get rejected he's like okay um he's like how about this and so he goes he opens up his the instacart app and he buys a six a sixpack of beer and he put sends it to the uh YC headquarters for Gary tan and um he tells the driver hey this is important one like text me when you know it's done then Gary uh Gary tan like calls him he's like hey uh what is this and he goes this is the thing I was applying with this is instacart I just went on my phone and I ordered you groceries I ordered you a sixpack of beer and one of our delivery guys dropped it off and it's the same thing that Jesse hitor was saying the other day where he was like the difference between a pitch and a Pres presentation like the difference between the paper pitch versus getting someone to feel the experience um it's that same thing and so Gary then emails the partners and he's like at that point I think that they called him back and they're like hey I can't believe we're doing this we're we've never let anyone in this late but if you're interested we'd like to have you and for YC that means YC owns 7% of this own 7% of this company that ended up being worth you know $6 billion dollar that one that one decision which is also goes to show the power of brand right like YY was not trying they weren't it's not like they hunted down instacart and had the genius whatever it's that the founders wanted that YC stamp that brand so badly that they were willing to like jump through hoops push through a no to get to a yes and YY gets to make hundreds of millions dollars off of it that's the power of having a brand that people recognize and care about and feel like is going to help their odds of success yeah man those guys have killed it and then Paul Graham just effed off and lives in England now in the woods writing poetry and playing frisbee with this kids yeah he he booked the win which nobody does he's like cool I'm out of the race now I'm going to go enjoy my life not allowed our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better uh which one you want to do yeah okay so I don't even know really why this fascinates me but it does so this is a little primer for this uh do you know what the Indian Hollywood is called Bollywood Bollywood correct you know that's the $100 question okay here's the $200 question do you know that in do you know that Bollywood is the second biggest like kind of movie industry in the world yes okay good there you go that's a freebie now what you don't know what you probably don't know is that the that Bollywood is famous people the famous people in Bollywood are like the are the most famous people on Earth aren't they it's like George Clooney times 10 yeah exactly so like shukan Ora Bashan these guys are like Gods meaning if they get the flu or they get sick there's thousands of people standing outside their building with candles like being like take my health uh like you know you can't die and the reason why is that the stars in India it's not like so it's not like George Clooney so George Clooney will come onto the scene in his 20s but he hasn't really made it yeah there 30s he becomes a star and by his 40s he's kind of on the way out he plays a couple roles of old guys and he's done these guys in India it's like you get picked when you're 20 they're like you're the star and the movie is going to make you look like James Bond like you're you're only cool everybody loves you and you're the best and that's the role and then people watch that movie like this guy's the best then that same guy will be the hero in movies for the next 30 to 40 years got it like he'll be 50 and he'll be like he's the Big Man on Campus at college and it's like what this guy's 50 and he's playing that role type of thing and and like you know but the girl in the movie will be in her 20s and he'll be in his 40s or 50s but he's like the the hero the stud and so don't don't don't the movies even have intermissions aren't they like three hour long movies yeah yeah there's a halftime where you go and like eat um it's pretty great honestly that's a that's a that's something that every movie should do um the other thing about movies in India all music in India comes from the movies so every movie is a musical that's weird and then every M every song comes from a movie so so like there's no like hit song that's not in the movies it's like all one pie right so it's like the center of culture okay so why does that matter why am I telling you all about this well because one thing has really changed and once I realized that I was like if that changed that's going to cause a whole bunch of other changes and here's the change so most of these Indian stars that I'm talking about when they're in their 20s and their 30s they look like your boy their body was a little a little round it was it was a little soft it was a normal person's body and all of a sudden these guys turned 50 and they're now absolutely shredded every Jack City Jack City every single movie star now like this guy run SN so basically they're all jacked and they all went from normal looking people normal humans to 55y olds with 12 packs and the so if you think about that you're like okay whatever who cares these guys discovered like testosterone and HGH and like dieting and working out cool but there's like a carryon effect again these guys are Gods they're heroes in India so now I met up with this uh Sonia has a has a cousin who's like in India this guy's 12 years old the last time he came to visit America all he cared about was like video games because he's like oh I love playing video games video games are amazing as any 10-year-old cares about and the second thing he cared about was like going to Target he's like oh Walmart can I go to Walmart can I go to Target because he had seen like you know Mr Beast giving away $10,000 out of out of Walmart he's like oh my God I can't wait to go that's my dude R Sing looks like Wolverine yeah exactly and if you go look at this guy like five years ago or seven years ago when he's like got his you know 10 years ago when he got his break in movies like did not look anything like this so anyways now the guy came to visit and I was like so like what's your favorite video game now you want to go to Walmart buddy and he's like no you have a gym and I was like yeah but like you're a kid what do you mean and he's like he started going to the gym twice a day at my house and all he wanted to talk about was the gym and I was like huh I was like oh of course like all the movie stars got shredded that became the new male ideal standard and so of course now everybody there is on like a fitness kick which made me think who's making protein powder in India and so I went deep on this and I started looking up I I was like if if Fitness is now thing if getting shredded is now the thing the whole supplements and fitness industry that we have here is going to translate over there it's going to be rebuilt overnight and it's going to be 10 times bigger right India doesn't seem like a supplement they don't seem like they don't seem like a supplement culture as of now until these guys if you go look at these guys' Instagram profile and they're like this is the my favorite peanut butter I could eat that other peanut butter and get fat but if I eat this peanut butter I get fit sure enough that they selling like hot cakes I ordered some from India it just arrived in like a giant styrofoam container um and I was like and so now you see that whole industry blowing up and I I would love to I'm a little bit far away from it right like I'm not like in the scene so it's hard for me to participate but I'm looking I'm on the hunt for finding the right investment that is in the Indian Fitness scene because it is a necessary consequence of the movie stars getting shredded anyways that's my Indian food is if you had to make a ranking of cuisine of one to diabetes of like Cuisine that's set up to make you look amazing naked uh Indian food would not be at the top of that list you know like maybe Mexican food like avocados meat rice all right great you've heard about the Mediterranean diet you've never heard about the Bollywood diet where's like the fried cheese and coconut milk diet you know what I mean like it's not exactly set up to like you know like what is it naan and ghee is that is that butter Rice C bread butter and fried cheese like it's not it's not entirely set up to make you look good in the nude so that's good the Indians uh maybe now they're going to understand macros and they're going to stay in the the need for protein exactly and I went and I looked up the Indian Fitness influencers on Instagram because I was like oh there's going to be Fitness influencers who are they these guys have like 12 million 20 million followers whereas like the same person in the US market will have like 800,000 to a million or two million just because there so many more people and people in India are like absolutely addicted to the Facebook ecosystem of apps like WhatsApp is everything the second best thing to Whatsapp Instagram you know like what's behind that Facebook and like that's just like that's the internet there you know and you know that you've had some success India has had some success in Olympics recently the 4x4 the 4 the 4x400 meter dash with uh India got like second or third at the world championships the most recent gold you joking or is that real it's real CA because we used to have like a like a Archer or something like that a shooter that was like the only guy who was even close to um um the guy who won the Olympics and the world championships and the javelin Indian guy wow uh and he looks great he looks he looks like a he looks like a like you want to look like him been eating eating some of that protein peanut butter no the uh Indians are doing good in track and field lately um and so and by like lately I mean like last year and it's like the only time an Indian has ever done half decent in track if you look at soccer there's like no Indian players you look at basketball there's no Indian players there's like none zero it's crazy I've never seen like a 6'8 Indian no they exist trust me billion people you're gonna the bell curve like when you have a billion people under the area of the bell curve you're going to get you're going to get people that are that are tall there's one guy actually he's on the Kings uh like development team Sim bullar he's 7 72 or something like that I've seen Giants in from every country I don't remember seeing a a a 6'8 Indian guy with a 35 in vert I've never seen that that I've never seen yes you're correct um speaking of Indian things uh our boy uh Anan from CB insights by the way he came on here and we were just talking about cap table he's only raised I think eight or10 million there's a rumor I told him I'm G to talk I go I'm G to talk about this on the Pod but don't tell me anything I'm just reading this article that I read there's a rumor that they're about to sell for $800 million um so our guest a non pretty cool if they we on the pot I remember we were like this thing's got to be worth 300 400 million and he was like you know non-committal about it but I think he probably knew it was worth more than that in the article it said they're doing 80 million in Revenue so 10x Revenue 10x Revenue that would be pretty amazing I mean I would I if I had a bet I bet he owns half the company so he would make many hundreds of millions of dollars uh that would be huge and as a reminder if people didn't see that episode you should go cuz he's an idea machine so the episode we did with Anand is awesome because he has like 50 startup ideas that we went through and reacted to as well as he tells the story of his father passed away and his father owned a chemical plant in India and he's running CB insights a tech startup in in America that's doing well and then he just was like I have to deal with this like my father passed away there's a plant there's like a hundred people working there and so he goes to India and he learns how to run this plant while running CV insights to employees I think he stabilizes it gives and then like created like some Equity plan or whatever and then and then bounced but really kind of Amazing Story do you think that life do you think that life for a non let's say he sells let's say that he I he lives in New Jersey so let's just say that he pays half in taxes let's say that he owns half the company so he makes $400 million let's say that he walks away with 300 million do you think that there's a difference in life from 300 million and 50 million not really yeah I don't think so either really you know I I would imagine after 50 you can buy the jet instead of rent the jet you know like what's the difference what is he gonna do yeah I don't think it matters no I what I will say is like it's all relative to the person so like you know Mike Tyson found a way to spend 100 million dollars right like you know people can find a way to spend but then also Elon took you know a couple hundred million bucks and used it to fund his own crazy moonshot bets that nobody else would do right so like for Elon the difference between 50 and $ 250 or whatever million dollars was the difference of Tesla and SpaceX existing versus maybe they wouldn't have um or surviving maybe they wouldn't have because he was able to put the money in so I guess to the right person yes but for 99.9% of people no yeah I don't think it makes any difference I chamath had a good episode on uh on uh Allin and he goes after 50 million it made zero difference like I had that I could acquire everything I wanted to at 50 and anything else he was like it was like stakes in basketball teams but that means zero difference that's just like in a business expense when um whenever I hear stuff like this like when people are like you know oh you know money doesn't make you that happy or like you know after this amount doesn't really do anything for you it's like yeah you're probably right but I'm just going to check yeah I would like to find out I'd like to find out I'm I'm gonna go ahead and test for myself I think that all the time as well uh all we did this episode where someone like asking me like what was it like uh after making a little bit and I was like it feels this way and this way but you should go and figure it out on your own you should you should you should double check my math nval had a great thing because like nval is like the like um you know the wise uh guy in the in the in the the tech and business ecosystem and you would think that somebody who's so wise and is like you know sort of enlightened is going to just be like you know what like uh it's not what matters and he does say it's not the main thing that matters he's like you know the real goal is is um you know a strong mind a strong body and a house full of love but he's like you know nobody wants to hear that and he goes the easiest way to escape the rat race is just to win and then let it then you can let it go if that's far easier than trying to convince you not to play and I was like that is practical wisdom he's like it won't make you significantly happier but you're not going to believe me until you do it yourself so go ahead and get after it yeah exactly yeah I love that practical wisdom um you want to do any more of these we we can do one more uh do you want to do you want to do this Metropolis thing or IMG well let's do Metropolis so I don't know much I don't know too much about this but I think that it's pretty wild what did you see so we both got interested I did a little bit of research but basically there's a startup that the the the the founder he originally had a company called I think Park me and it was just like an app that told you where parking spot spots were and he ended up selling it but it wasn't n like a home run of a success I think like they got their money back plus a little bit something like that then he goes on and he's like I did this all wrong I have to think about this as an investor and we have to like acquire parking lots and we're going to create technology that makes it easy so you don't need to like uh you don't need to scan in when you go and pay at a parking lot we're just going to be able to track your car automatically he's been doing this for a couple years and he just bought a parking lot like a a company that owns a bunch of parking lots for $1.1 billion dollar and I saw that and I was like all right what the hell is going on here yeah the same thing caught my eye the guy made like a there's like a billion dollar acquisition or something like that what I thought was the story is that so there's this one blueprint of business that's a very good blueprint this is the blueprint that constellation software uses which is vertical SAS what is vertical SAS vertical SAS is how um oh there's a you know every Golf Club in the country needs some golf club booking management system system so people can book their T tea times and then they can rent their clubs and then they can you know have a membership and whatever and there's some person out there that made some software sold it to some golf clubs and what a company like constellation will do is they're like perfect because that software is not going to be like you know Microsoft is not going to go compete in that market Facebook and Google are not going to go compete in that market honestly nobody really is going to compete in this market and if there are if there is someone it's it's kind of so fragmented that as they start to get momentum they get to one23 million of annual revenue we'll just buy them and then we'll own all of the golf club software systems uh or sorry golf uh like golf uh what what do you call them like the members club or whatever whatever it's called um but basically vertical sass software and so same thing for dentists and same thing for um whatever rent you know industrial rentals or whatever so vertical SAS has been a very very lucrative play especially if you roll them up so have you been to Constellation website by the way uh not they like give you like they give you like five categories of like businesses they own you click on like all right this this one of five and then they give you like a list of 10 you click on one of the 10 but it's they own so many businesses that they're basically linking to other companies that own other companies meaning like we own this holding company which owns holding companies in these five categories and you have to click through four different websites to actually see the name of a company so they must own hundreds or even thousands of small software businesses it has acquired over 500 businesses since being founded um they I think they make offers to like hundreds of soft hundreds of companies every year if not a thousand companies a year or something like that to to give an example so Jonas Jonas is one of these five they have six groups so six groups Jonas is one of the groups and it says they do Hospitality clubs and Resorts spas and fitness construction payments Moving and Storage you click it it says so you go to Jonas Software and it says we're a family of vertical Market software companies and then they own 140 just under the Jonas umbrella it's crazy right in 40 different markets it's crazy it's it's a it's a really wild setup they have and uh if you haven't ever gone and read uh Mark Leonard's letters uh definitely like you know worth a worth that's like getting an MBA go go through and read all of his annual letters you know uh for the last like 25 years or whatever very interesting guy very interesting company we've talked about consolation before but what's interesting is I thought like it seemed like that was the blueprint you just buy vertical SAS companies and you roll them up what those parking guys doing is basically took the vertical SAS and then was like cool let's just own all the lots too let's make a vertical company that's not just SAS it's got SAS on the top but underneath it is the real estate and the the actual like um you know the brick and mortar underneath so that we can um like forget trying to sell our software to these guys and try to convince these old school parking operators that they should use our thing because it's more efficient we'll just buy it from them in the inefficient State and then use our software to make it more efficient and um so it seems like a pretty big bet if I understood it correctly but honestly I didn't do a ton of research just what I understood from the Tweet they paid 1.7 billion for a company that owns parking lots yeah it's a lot impressive that's huge right yeah um all right uh do we want to wrap there yeah let's wrap it up all right that's a [Music] pot

all right I'm setting my timer I'm going to give myself 31 minutes to give you 10 specific AI business [Music] ideas you know I'm doing this because I see a lot of stuff on YouTube that's like hey uh AI is the next big thing and then they're like you're like okay what how for me what should I do with it um and there's no answers or AI is gonna kill us all like really [ __ ] how and like we don't know um so I just don't like the the just general enthusiasm without the specifics and so this is all about the specifics and I think I'm well qualified to do this because I've my whole life I've been an entrepreneur and I've been an idea guy I ran an idea lab where I was basically funded to just come up with business ideas and then build them for six years um I then have a podcast now this podcast is all about business ideas I've also invested in the last year maybe $2 million do into AI companies so I've about a dozen companies that I said yes to plus probably another hundred or so that we passed on so I've seen a bunch in this AI space I know what the the best entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley are doing that's where I live and so I wanted to share with you my list from number 10 to number one number one being the best the biggest opportunity that I see in the in the space that if I wasn't just chilling out rich and happy and being a dad I would go and jump in and do these right away instead I'm going to invest from the side I hope somebody takes an idea from this list and just goes and does it um but before I tell you the ideas a quick little history lesson a quick little trip down memory lane a little I Told You So three years ago on this exact podcast I did an episode called is GPT the next big thing I think it was like episode 94 we're on like 500 now and this was back in July of 2020 so it's like Co had just hit people are freaking out but me and Sam got on podcast and we said is gpt3 the next big thing we had gotten access to this tool that there was no chat GPT at the time you had to like get a favor from somebody to even be able to try it and we used it to write rap lyrics which of course being idiots that we are we thought oh that's the best thing we could do with artificial intelligence and so we well we thought it was amazing we were like wow this is really good and we the episode is GPT the next big thing we were basically saying yeah it will be now that's 2020 fast forward today open AI is worth $90 billion they're doing a billion dollars a year chat GPT is the fastest growing product in history hit 100 million users um you know so I'm not saying that we called it I'm not saying that we're business Geniuses we kind of did and we kind of are so you know if if you had listened to me then you probably could have made a bunch of money listen to me now because I got for today I'm going to share with you 10 specific AI business ideas ranging from simple doable things for somebody who's non- technical all the way to like moonshot really big ideas that that uh I think are gamechanging and so I'm going to read you the list from number 10 to number one they include things from about you know Robotics and therapy and celebrities and education to porn to I got everything and the last one the very last one I think is the biggest idea um that exists today so the biggest I think it is the biggest opportunity that exists today for any entrepreneur you know like um when you think about uh Zuckerberg stumbling into sort of like the social networking craze or um you know when Steve Jobs created the iPhone that changed everything there are these sort of change everything moments and like you know I was a kid when the internet came out I'm 35 years old now so I was you know I remember being on the internet as like a 12 or 13y old um using like you know whatever very basic uh dialup connections and BBs forums and stuff like that but it was clear to me that the internet was a thing it's just I was a kid so I didn't think about how I could Ben like I just wanted to use it I didn't think about I wasn't an entrepreneur I was a teenager right I couldn't even spell entrepreneur still can't um but then when I graduated from college I graduated 2010 the iPhone had come out the year before I think the App Store had come out but I wasn't I didn't have the light bulb on I didn't really understand that there are few times I think what's that Warren Buffett quote he's like um something like um there are moments there are moments every once in a while where the skies get cloudy and it begins to rain opportunity and when it does let us not run out with spoons but with bathtubs to to you know to catch the opportunity um so I didn't really realize when mobile was the big opportunity and it was right in front of my nose right like we were working on things and we had a mobile developer one guy and we would you know we would uh we would try to make a mobile version of our website but we didn't realize yo Mobile's changing everything and all of a sudden you know this thing's got a GPS that means now Uber is possible Google Maps is possible this has a camera so that means that Snapchat and Instagram is are are now possible um you know I'm carrying this with me everywhere so all of a sudden WhatsApp is possible uh you know this thing has an accelerometer inside that means that my fitness pal is possible right so the the technology unlocks the opportunity so now to my specific list of 10 ideas that I think anybody could do and by the way here's my disclaimer these specific ideas don't matter I know I'm hyping them up a little bit but it's not the idea is that matter uh nval has this great quote where he says you know you don't read books for the information you read books because books spark ideas in your head right reading a great book is like uh you know lighting a match or starting a bonfire in your brain and so that's my goal I want to start a little bonfire in your brain I want these ideas to help you get to the real ideas I don't think that these are necessarily going to be the ones but I hope that they really stimulate you to think um okay so let's jump in number 10 eliminate the weight okay so we think of the internet as this fast place a place where you can just click and you instantly get what you want but um that's true like the internet if you just compare normal business I used to have to drive go to my car drive to a store Park get out walk in if I wanted to buy something and now the internet I I don't have to do any of that [ __ ] I just website Click Boom it'll be here in two days right that's kind of amazing so the internet has killed waiting in a bunch of different ways and that's generated billions and billions and billions of dollars of value but all waiting is not gone there's still some waiting left um I want to tell you about it so like for example this is uh one of my companies is called Shephard right I'm a minority owner of uh of shephard I bought a minority stake earlier this year they do a very simple thing so they find you employees overseas that will cost you 80% less than if you're hiring in the US they're like recruiters that will find the best talent in the Philippines or latam that just solves whatever problem you have okay great so now when somebody comes to this website and this business works right it makes millions of dollars a year but it also loses I believe millions of dollars a year because of one very simple problem which is that when you click start hiring here it's going to tell you to book a call it says great tell us some information and then when you do when once you fill this in uh you know you fill in a small form as soon as you do that then it's going to uh tell you to book a call and that book of calls might be 2 days from now 3 days from now 4 days from now um by then you're cooled off right like you you know you've lost anybody any salesperson knows that like you need to strike while the iron hot you're going to have the highest conversion rate in that moment so let me show you what an AI company is doing that I think is very smart this is called some company called same day I'm not involved in this at all uh I just think they're it's a very cool idea so they're like hey what if we just had a phone agent an AI phone agent that could just rep reply to anybody who calls you right away so uh listen to this how can I help you today yeah I got a call from my wife a minute ago she said there's a bunch of ants coming through our kitchen window how soon can you guys come out that's the worst luckily I can probably have someone out as soon as tomorrow to take care of those ants can I get your address to confirm yeah it's uh but can you transfer you to a person yeah I can transfer you to a person but you'll be on hold for about 9 minutes now I can answer any questions and get you scheduled in under two how does that sound Aaron it sounds good but what's it going to cost oh of course I just need to know all right you get the idea uh I think it's funny they made him have a accent but um you know you instead of I'm interested and then three-day Gap now we get on a zoom call and you're trying to remember the context and then we fumble and bumble how about right when I say I'm interested a AI sales agent is going to call me you know or create a voice call right here on the on on the browser and um ask the questions that he needs to do to qualify me as a potential customer as well as answer the questions that you have and even give you a sales pitch right you might look at that and be like oh you know that it's a little slow the way it talks or it's not as good as a human and I would tell you two things number one that uh the conversion rate in the moment the versus the drop off of people not not B you know bouncing because they don't want to book a call or um not showing up to the call like the show up rate might be 65% to a call uh you know you get these huge drop offs for every step of the every additional step in the funnel so you want to just remove steps in any funnel so I believe that an AI sales agent will be um higher converting than doing it the sort of slower human way and the second thing is this is V1 imagine you know like you remember the V1 of anything the brick cell phones or the V even V1 of the iPhone compared to what we have now on iPhone 15 like just wait two years this is going to be incredible and it's already good enough to um make up for the fact that you know you know how many businesses don't even have a phone number or don't answer the phone when you call them like every Pest Control service or lawn care service or self storage facility or whatever you name it um you can go and become the uh the AI phone sales guy for every business on the internet I think that's that's one opportunity that's there for the taking is forget this whole idea of you know call me I'll call you back or book a call in a few days and we'll talk it's no no it's going to be we'll talk right now with my highly trained sales agent who always sticks to the script is always polite never gets frustrated never gets sick never takes a day off um that's what's going to happen here that that's that's where this is going okay idea number nine therapy for everybody so therapy used to be pretty taboo and every year it's becoming less and less so uh every year more and more people are going into therapy and there are multiple billion dollar therapy startups that just connect you with a therapist however that's still only a fractional the opportunity how do you make this 100 times more accessible right like I think most people could probably benefit from having somebody to talk to having somebody who's there for them supportive asks good questions gives good advice that seems like something that's going to help every couple every individual person every executive Etc and uh the biggest barrier to this is now is cost and sort of like the friction or privacy that's involved it's almost like uh remember how hymns came out and they were like you know what erectile dysfunction is a big deal it's a big problem but people don't want to go to the doctor admit this to another person and then have to go to a pharmacy and say hey can I get my pills please um instead what if it was you could just tell a medicine you could just get diagnosed online get the prescription really quickly from the comfort of your own home without going anywhere and then we'll deliver it to your doorstep in very discreet packaging and there you go and hims and Road did this and built billion doll companies just on that one that one way of increasing access well I think for therapy you got to do two I think going to decrease the cost and increase the Privacy so solution put an AI therapist in everyone's pocket you train it on 100 million hours of therapy uh you know transcripts and um and conversations that that that exist or could exist and um and you provide the service to to everybody even people who can't afford a $100 an hour therapist or $200 an hour hour therapist um you know you drop the cost of that by a 100x so how do I get this for $10 a month or $5 a month that's the that's the big opportunity and how do I in doing so you would 100x the number of people that get this benefit right it's a win-win and you know I don't know the exact specifics like you know you may need it's going to take some time to train this to be good um there may be some things like you know the difference between creating drugs or a supplement like you have to get you have to do like either clinical trials and get FDA approval or you just create a vitamin and you can like sell that online tomorrow um you know it might have to be framed less medically and more like a life coach I'm not sure but the the idea of providing therapy for everybody is a big idea number eight robots that automate warehousing so I for my e-commerce business was running a warehouse for I don't know a year year and a half uh we had a I don't know 10,000 or 15,000 foot facility here in California and we had 10 20 people there absolute pain in the ass for everybody nobody liked it they didn't like working there we didn't like having people there we didn't like running the thing it was slow it was expensive it was bad in like pretty much every single way then you look at Amazon and Amazon has invested billions of dollars I've read anything from10 billion all the way up to 100 as an estimate of how much they've invested in R&D around their warehouse automation uh back in the mid 2000s they bought a company for almost a billion dollars Kaa I think Ka systems and those are those little sleds you can see these insane videos online the sled basically like goes into the warehouse finds the set of boxes that somebody ordered something from picks it up dri back and these are all like there's hundreds of these going at once and they're all like part of one big brain so they know how to never bump into each other um and so they then they drive all the way up to a human who's sitting in a chair who just pulls the item out of the box puts it in the package and um that's you know what the Amazon product is and this is a perfect example of my export framework so my export business framework is basically it's a way to generate business ideas which is you look at any big company and you see what did they spend millions of dollars building a home brew solution for something that works for them and made their life better and then can you export that idea as a product that any company could use without having to spend the money on the R&D tons of examples of this uh simple one launch Darkly um billion- dooll company now they were working at Facebook Facebook had a feature that they had built intern a product they had buil built internally spent a bunch of engineering resources building which was a way to launch new features under feature Flags meaning you launch a feature it's in the app but you can turn it on for % of the population if if it's bug free then you can turn it on for 25% of the population or if it starts to have a bug you can turn it off quickly uh remotely from your server so idea of feature Flags they productized it took it out there and said hey the thing that Facebook uses for their app you should use in your app and of course it works so I think somebody's going to do that here with Amazon's Warehouse technology I'll just give you a crazy stat just to this stat is the business plan for this business right I talk about this idea of one chart businesses one stat businesses it's a single stat that basically encapsulates the entire opportunity which is that today 2% of all warehouses use robotics right so 2% of all fulfillment warehouses are using robots today that number is going very close to 100% so just the shift from what's going to take it from 2% to 100% you could just sit down and brainstorm what is that going to take is it new robotics technology is it better sales uh you know better sales and development process is it uh Consulting practice what are the different ways you could take that number from two to 100 I think that's just one big opportunity all right number seven uh similar to what I just said Consulting McKenzie for AI so Technologies come but they don't it's not evenly distribut doesn't just get everywhere all at once right there's still like I don't know four million people would dial up internet using AOL we get online right now in the in the United States and so um it takes time for these Technologies to sort of propagate through the through the community Through the population and so AI AI does all this amazing stuff it can help businesses become more efficient more smart more intelligent serve their customers better but it's not just going to like appear overnight in every company um at all no way and so I think somebody can build a killer combo of conferences content and Consulting the three C's package those together and build something so here's what I would do if I'm working at mckinzy right I'm one of these you know Fancy Pants smart people who works at gets a job at Mackenzie and you have two choices you're either going to grind the Mackenzie ladder for like the next I don't know 5 to 10 years with the end goal of maybe becoming a partner someday and making a million bucks a year or door number two quit your job tomorrow and launch a AI specific Consulting practice that is going to identify one type of customer maybe it's a mid-market industrial companies or it's lawyer law firms or dental practices or whatever and identify AI Market fit so identify one AI tool or process that would help one type of customer and start there start Consulting there you can build a multi-million dollar service business from there and stack more and more and basically in the same 10 years instead of just grinding it out at Mackenzie just spend five years doing this on AI uh building the AI consulting company and sell it back to Mackenzie for 100 or thousand exra payout uh you know you I believe that there's going to be billion- dooll Consulting companies that are specifically just about AI that the big Consulting companies deoy PWC McKenzie Etc they're going to need to buy they're going to acquire practices that that do this and so I think if you have the the the chops to do it conferences content and Consulting I think a combo of those three uh would work and specifically around conferences what I don't mean is what I think everybody wants to do is create the AI conference and that's cool somebody's going to do that but that's also very crowded instead I think the easier opportunity is to create the AI for X conference so AI for healthcare conference hey Healthcare you work you have a Healthcare company uh we have a conference that's specifically about marrying the best AI companies and startups and and experts to healthcare companies like you and seeing how you guys are going to be using AI in the next three years in order to build a better company and I think you could do that with every every Niche every industry every industry could have this so you could do this in healthcare you could do this in um whatever you can do this in farming you can do this in any any industry any vertical industry you could you could create conferences around that so I think that's separately just a good idea all right next one Cameo okay so Cameo was this app that got really popular because it let you buy shoutouts and greetings from celebrities great but if we just step back for a second like influencers and celebrities money off their name their face their voice all that and today if they want to do that they have to cut these deals with companies they have to agree hey you're going to have to fly out to Tucson and we're going to film this commercial and you're going to be here on set all day and you have to read these lines and it's it's a pain in the ass and that's why you have to charge a bunch of money for it well now that AI is here we have something called Deep fake technology which basically means you can make a fake video of anyone's face uh you've probably seen the uh the Deep fake Tom Cruz or you've seen the Deep fake um music video That's that was made where the guy shape face was shifting from One Celebrity to the next um Indiana Jones I think used deep fake Tech to have like the young Indiana versus the the old Harrison Fords Harrison Ford Indiana Jones def fakes are getting really really good and um so this is an opportunity now here's the pro here's where everyone gets it wrong people think entrepreneurs think I talked to a lot of startups said this they're pitching me for investment and they're like we're going to make this defect Tech it's going to be great this not a tech problem really right now it's actually a rights problem so what somebody needs to do the move here is not to go all in on product but to go all in on BISD which is a total narrative violation nobody says hey go all in on B but that's what you need to do for this business what you got to do is create some sort of digital likeness license you need to go to athletes and celebrities everybody CA represents and WME you got to go to them and you got to get partner with him and basically say hey I'd like to sign up to be your rights provider rights holder and provider and license um licensing technology for you so that anytime a brand comes and wants to use your name and face and voice um they can do so and you can get paid for it they can have the official training data for you they can have your signature and your rights that saying you're you're allowed to use my face and my voice to do this and then after you have the rights once you and this is Beautiful by the way because we all know in businesses the value of a business is in the defensibility and the defensibility here is not the technology it's the rights ownership so if you can go lock up the rights there's a land grab right now if you can go lock up the rights to the right names and faces and voices um and you own that right you either license it from them and then you sulic it out or you create the product that they use to manage their rights and licenses uh you have a mo because there's people only want cele celebrities to do this and so um whoever gets some first wins and after that you can either buy technology partner with technology do whatever you want to actually deliver this deep fake stuff and so you know in the future when LeBron James does a McDonald's commercial he's not going to have to go fly to Georgia and film that commercial they're just going to say put in an API request uh pay the money get the license to his face his voice is whatever then they're going to be able to script it he's going to be able to sign off for approval that's it like that's how the whole process is going to go he's going to make more money with less time that's where that's going so idea number five is the opposite of that the anti- Cameo so I was on Tik Tok yesterday and I saw this video of Mr Beast giving away iPhones now your boy's not a dummy so I know he's not actually doing that this was a deep fake but a lot of people didn't know that they were clicking on it and in fact Mr Beast tweeted this out was like hey uh a lot of people are seeing this and this is effed up how can I get rid of this like how do I stop this this is terrible you're using my face in ways that I definitely don't want um similarly I saw you know Taylor Swift is all the rage right now because she's dating Travis Kelce um somebody used mid Journey or one of the AI image tools to make photos of Taylor Swift like smoking weed or whatever like they put her in a bunch of compromising situations that you wouldn't want to be in she doesn't want to be in that's bad for her brand but now it's easy for anybody to just deep fake that and so so um you need an anti- Cameo so the so protection so the takeown and protection and detection and monitoring service for all these celebrities to say hey we are scouring the web to make sure your face is not showing up in defect porn or in ads that you're not actually endorsing and things like that um that's going to become a no-brainer business it's a it's a consequence of how good this technology is and by the way for all my crypto haters out there this is a great blockchain use case there's a company doing this that um basically what they do is they say yeah we're going to basically let you create uh every everyone who who is a celebrity or whatever anybody any company you have a private key and so anytime there's media out there you can sign the sign the media with your private keys that only you controlled to say yes this is real I actually said this I actually vouch for this I actually created this I actually endorsed this and what's going to happen is that in the future media that doesn't have that's digital signature is going to be seen as untrustworthy and so what they did with the blockchain was very smart was they let anybody create their keys their digital signature so that they can sign off on these and have it encoded that yes I indeed did say this do say this I endorsed this I allowed for this um so that's going to be a big deal all right number four AI tutors so uh education is obviously a big space how amazing would it be if everybody had their own AI tutor so everybody had a patient infinitely intelligent um tutor who is going to let them just take a picture of the problem that you're trying to solve you can ask me to explain it you can ask me for more examples you can ask me to go slower you can ask me to go faster you can qu I the tutor can quiz you after they've explained it to you once to make sure that you understand the concept the tutor can draw diagrams the tutor can animate diagrams faster than any human tutor could uh better than anyone could on a chalkboard and um and ultimately they can keep track of what you have Mastery on and where you need work and it can kind of customize a curriculum that fits you versus just you going by the book of whatever whatever the herd is trying to learn right now and so I think an amazing thing that's going to happen is that we're going to get these AI tutors that are really going to help you know help teach you and I think this is one of the big use cases of chat GPT today is like sort of like homework shortcuts but I think part of those shortcuts are going to be not just do it for you but uh explain it explain it to me if I want to learn right and so you're not going to be able to force people to learn but for the people who do want to learn I think an AI tutor is going to be a kind of a GameChanger I know for me I used to love watching Khan Academy videos anytime I had a question because Salon is just an amazing teacher he could teach millions of people because he's patient he's clear he uh has a very good little drawing setup this is what's going to happen with AI we're going to have salc cons for all of us some that are funny some that are good at math some that are good at um really slow explanations some that are very Advanced and very keep you on your toes you're going to have different AI tutors to choose from okay number three call center accent changes this is a fun one so um a lot of customer service help as we know is offshore it's cheaper that's why businesses do it however there's one big cost that you know people get enraged When you call you know you're calling Dell for help and uh you know all of a sudden you're getting Arjun in India who says hey it's Arjun from Dell and he's got the accent and he doesn't quite understand what you're saying the connection isn't great blah blah blah well there's companies right now that are doing AI accent removal so what they're doing is they the guy arin's in India but when he talks he sounds like Adam in you know California um because on the Fly they're able to adjust using AI his voice so that he doesn't have the accent and so think about it if you're a company would you not pay an extra whatever 5% 10% to be able to remove accents from all of your your uh customer support people so that um you know you have higher NPS higher higher customer service scores and less less issues and complaints of course of course you will and so um now you you multiply that across a very big industry of customer support and that's the that's that's one really specific way that you take this techn techn te ology unlock of you know being able to imitate anyone's voice and you apply it in a business context so number two I had to do it I had to do it you know me I'm the guy who's been telling you that only fans was going to be a big business for for years now ai porn or aka the Fantasy Factory so porn is one of the biggest markets in the world uh historically porn has been an early adopter of new technology so video streaming you know early on was used for porn online payments early on was used for porn and so porn has been an early adopter of many new technologies um and I think there's a big benefit for AI porn so first I think on the consumer side you're going to have on the demand side you have infinite personalization to your taste like have you ever gone to a porn site and seen how many categories there are there's like a trillion categories why because there's a trillion fantasies that people have that they're looking for and um you know what whatever however number of categories they have there's probably actually room for a 100 times more right because that's just what they're able to service that's not actually the limitations of what people want or what they're interested in and so infinite personalization is is the first thing so what exactly is your thing we can provide that to you that's going to beat out somebody else who just says here's what I have do you like it right so it's like the difference between you know going to Blockbuster back in the day and seeing 25 movies on the Shelf versus Netflix or Amazon which have an infinite shelf um it's the difference between you know uh watching you know one episode of America's Funniest Home Videos versus opening up Tik Tok anytime you want swiping getting personalized entertainment bite-sized entertainment for you in an infinite for an infinite scroll right like it's one is a lot more powerful and and and uh and and uh will satisfy demand much better okay then the supply side AI porn I believe is more ethical so you know just like the way we have plant-based proteins and cruelty-free makeup and vegan leather no humans are going to be harmed in the production of this video right like I think that uh the idea that we could satisfy the demand for porn without subjecting people to the lifestyle of being a porn professional um is is that what they call thems porn porn I like how they don't call themselves porn professional porn stars I like that I'm a business star not an entrepreneur um yeah so I think that's going to happen I think for the companies it drops your cogs down right so like you don't have to worry about all the takeown notices and and copyright issues and lawsuits that you're going to that you have from uh from people uploading stolen works or having to share Revenue with all the production companies there it's just going to drop down to whatever the cost is of the GPU to create the thing right that's that's what it's going to drop down to and so I believe you know if you ever go want to go down a rabbit hole go look up the company mindgeek in Canada they own all the porn sites it's you know a multi- multi-billion dollar conglomerate just [ __ ] spitting off tons and tons of cash somebody's going to do somebody's going to go after that market with AI and I think they will win because again way more powerful tool to satisfied demand way lower cogs and more ethical Supply that's a winning formula this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is full fly integrated W I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from 3 days ago I totally missed hpot grow better all right now we're here number one this is it this is the winner of my list okay this is the number one biggest opportunity and I hate to be that guy that's like this is the biggest opportunity of our lifetimes right like time share guy all the time share guys who are now YouTubers just selling the biggest the biggest Next Big Thing uh but in this case I think it's actually warranted I mean ai ai is a big big freaking deal right like you got to be nuts to be denying that at this point and um within AI this is what I genuinely believe is the biggest opportunity so let me just rewind for a second if you think about the previous waves I count four waves um in my lifetime of giant sort of inflections or opportunities the the sort of like the big gold rush moments the huge tidal waves that you could go surf as an entrepreneur so the first one was early internet right and now you have what they used to call the information superhighway if you remember that dorky phrase uh but it was right information was the thing the ability to find anything and there's really two big Winners so Google and Amazon were the two biggest winners of the information find anything Paradigm and what you could do is you know Google let you go find any information and Amazon let you go find any stuff and those two created a trillion dollars or more than a trillion almost $2 trillion of value just on those two companies alone out of the information wave second wave you then got was communication so started with email but then quickly became all social networking social media so Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Snapchat uh Pinterest WhatsApp YouTube all of that right so the ability for people to communicate with each other and this even extended by the way to like Riders connect communicating with drivers right in Uber basically the ability to say I need a ride and somebody else say I have a ride for you right that connecting the dots PE human coordination and communication was the big second wave and again a trillion dollars plus of market value created out of that communication wave that came okay then what's come next so then you had the value wave and this was now we're talking uh early 2010s up to like basically the last decade 2010 to 2020 and this is crypto so Bitcoin ethereum just those two alone are a trillion dollars of value that got created right the best investment you could make make since that the year I graduated 2010 would have been into Bitcoin and ethereum those that is the best asset that that that was created the best highest performer and uh again so we had digital information then we had digital communication then we had digital value and so you know the ability to have a digital money and dig digital value and so now what's the next one the what's number four right coming into the 2020s we're going from 2020 to 2030 what's going to be the next one I believe it's digital intellig so that's AI okay so who's going to be the Bitcoin who's going to be the Google who's going to be the Facebook of the intelligence wave well so far we've seen you know Nvidia make chips they've done extremely well we've seen open AI become almost a hundred billion dollar company uh by training these models that you can use for AI applications and I think those are great but I think there's going to be more and the one that I think is missing is you know I had two kind of that I was thinking about the first one was self-driving cars cuz I'm like like okay that's a you know driving is a huge part of of human life and when that goes self-driving you're going to have safer more efficient more comfortable more entertainment you're going to have a better ride experience and that's going to obviously change the way that cars work right cars are parked 90% of the time but when they're self-driving you're going to park your car and you're going to say go make me money car and the car is going to go drive around and be an Uber for people picking people up right it's a just a game changer in terms of how this works we're going to need less cars which means we need less parking which means we need different roads and City structures there's a whole bunch of things that can change but as I was thinking about that I thought about a bigger opportunity and the bigger opportunity is actually related so I was like oh man self-driving cards are going to be great because you just get in the car and you just say your destination and then the car is going to figure out all the things to do to get you to your goal so I just say I'm trying to hey take me to Starbucks it's going to say great look up the nearest Starbucks find the address input the address to navigation turn the car on shift gears from Park to drive accelerate stop at the stop sign signal turn shift Lanes exit the highway whatever right all of the middle steps it's going to create a list and it's going to do them and what I realized was that's not going to stop at just cars that the biggest opportunity is the self-d doing to-do list just like we have the self-driving car and what's a self-d doing to-do list a self-d doing to-do list is going to be well all of our productivity today comes from basically the following the following system person thinks about what they want goal then they create a list of actions that they think will move them in the direction of that goal and then they do those actions and the the extent to which you hit your goals is based on your ability to like know what you want create the list of things you need to do to get there and then actually do the list well I think what AI is going to do is actually change how that works um it's actually going to let you just say what you want AI will then generate the list and then it'll just do it and so and we've seen this by the way so what this is called is right now they're calling this the agents and agents might end up being the uh information super highway like a word you know that that gets phased out over time but uh here's the the simple model we've all used chat GPT where you type something in and it gives you an answer and the better question you ask the better answer it'll give you or the you have to know what to prompt it to do if you don't do anything it's just going to sit there it's going to do absolutely nothing for you whereas there's a new model called AI agent what AI agents are based on is that you don't need to tell it you don't need to ask it specific questions or give it Specific Instructions for a task all you need to do is tell the AI what you want as your goal and what you want as your goal is um let's just take an example hey um I run a e-commerce business and I want to reduce um my inventory waste okay so I'm going to reduce my I'm going to make my inventory more efficient so the AI could then generate a list of things to do analyze the the uh inventory to find the highest fast movers and slow movers and then it will take the uh slow movers and it will put them on sale it will take the fast movers and it will analyze you know um what you're lacking uh you know where there's more demand than than you have Supply in stock it'll create a purchase order send the purchase order to the factory and get the next order delivered for you so you could see in theory how you'd be able to just say a goal and have the AI create a list and then do it another you know Silly example well let's say I wanted to lose 15 lbs well we all know to lose 15 lbs what you need to do is you need to uh you know uh burn more calories than you're going to consume well in theory AI is going to be able to help you do that so you're going to say I want to lose weight and it's going to say great we are going to take your current weight we're going to then create a calorie meal plan of uh how many calories you're supposed to intake per day and how many you're supposed to burn per day which is going to create a workout plan for you it's going to create a u a meal plan for you it's going to then take the meal plan it's going to create uh break that down into recipes break the recipes down into ingredients it's going to go on to instacart it's going to order the ingredients to your house for you um and you know there you go right it's going to take you as far as it can it's not going to be able to do every single thing in the real world until you have a robot sitting in your house that's going to then take those groceries and going to prepare the meal for you right like Jetson style um and we're talking about in the future but like this is the future like I mean dude I used to have this I'm holding up my phone like my cell phone right now that I can use to run my business to entertain myself endlessly for hours to play video games to navigate all around the world like I could I could pay for things on this I don't need my wallet it's insane right this thing this thing is insane to 12-year-old me and 12-year-old me is not that long ago that's 20 years ago or whatever it's like 12-year-old me would be mind-blown because 12-year-old me had just gotten their first computer in their house we used to have a computer room it was a room in our house called the computer room and whoever wanted to use a computer had to go to the computer room and when you in the computer room then you got the internet internet through a CD from AOL and then when we had that you used to have to pick and choose do you want to be able to receive phone calls as a house or do you want to be on the internet because if somebody picked up the phone when you were on the internet you would like disconnect from the internet and they would hear crazy internet sounds um like you it was insane like the way that we were when I you when I started on the internet to what now at holding my iPhone 15 Pro Max with you know wireless internet while I'm driving or on an airplane is mindblowing and so all I'm asking you to do is just sort of think 20 years in the future the idea that we're going to have you know our Jetson's robot in our house and we're going to be able to tell our to-do list just what are wishes and dreams are and then it's going to create the list and do them that's the big idea that is the big idea that is the idea that is mind-blowing that's also the idea that scares people by the way because you know the thought experiment is someone says Hey I want to maximize you know uh what's it the paperclip example I want to maximize the production of paperclips or sales for my Paperclip and it's like okay great the AI it got your goal and it doesn't care what comes in the way right it's going to start shredding cars to create scrap metal to produce more paper clips right it will it will do anything to hit that goal and so that's the scary part about Ai and now I'm not the guy to do the AI safety conversation and the AI ethics conversation that's not me I'm an idea guy uh I I'm thinking about how technology can do really cool things that will improve people's lives and then of course as we do them we're going to need to put in guide you know guard ril and guidelines and be able to not you know Crush all of civilization in the process but um that's kind of a debb downer I'm not really looking to get into that conversation what I'm excited about is a future where work gets done for you that's what's going to come from the intelligence wave that's different than the value wave the communication wave or the information wave the intelligence wave is going to do intelligent things it's going to use its brain for you right it's got this right side of the AI brain that can do creative [ __ ] it can draw it can write it can sing it can make song songs it can rap it can do anything and then on the left side it's got this like informational analytical brain that can you dump in a PDF and it'll summarize it for you in a second it'll generate a p&l for your business it'll give you advice strategic advice on your taxes right like it could do all these things that are highly let's say left brain and so now we have this AI intelligence brain and the ideas that I came up with were just my first pass at what's going to come from this I want to hear what you're going to do I mean I'm investing in this space if you're doing something cool reach out to me Sean shanp por.com I want to hear what your ideas are and I want to hear what you think about these go in the YouTube comments and let me know because that's it those are my ideas from 10 to one I hope you liked it I hope you enjoyed it I hope I started a little bonfire in your brain all right I'm out of [Music] here

when Moyes was selling native deodorant he didn't own the trademark and it was an issue he's got the deal done and they're like wait you don't have the trademark he's like yeah but there's no other native deodorant they're like okay Junior what are you talking about that's not how this works um you [Music] know all right today we thought it'd be fun to do a episode all about how we actually run our companies so we've been running companies for like I don't know 10 15 years now and like many people out there at the beginning we did a bunch of dumb stuff and so we're going to admit and confess to some of the dumbest things that we did running our companies and then talk about what we do now that's actually like we found that works so the stuff that didn't work and the stuff that works and this is around you know everything from like you know mission statements how we used to think that these were like super important and how we treated them versus what we do now or branding and naming our companies or goal setting um these are kind of like the shortcuts that we use now so what what actually that we found Works through the painful process of making embarrassing mistakes that's what I think we're going to do today yeah we got about like five or eight categories of like on hiring on creating comp plans on having boundaries with Steph these actually sound like boring when we're like just when I'm just reading that off but I promise you it's actually we have like interesting stories behind each one and stuff we wish we would have done earlier that I deeply regret that didn't do now or that I didn't do then but yeah we'll we'll go through all the stuff that we actually use on a day-to-day basis to run our companies the touchy feely stuff that's actually really important so I thought it'd be fun for us to share [ __ ] we do when we run our companies what are our almost like management hacks or shortcuts or like the methods that we use which as a disclaimer probably not the best probably not what they teach you in Harvard Business School or what you know like very polished you know seasoned Executives would do I remember when when I started uh one of my early companies it was in my internal mission statement was to hire 10,000 people and and then I hired like two people and I was like [ __ ] hey does got a new racer yeah yeah like how do I make this 10 uh it was horrible um and then it was like um and then the mission statement for the employees is like look like we're going to change whatever like right now the word is democratize we're democratizing the financial markets or whatever it's like whatever that equivalent is is what I said like we're going to change the world one newsletter at a time and so my missions statement did you really say that no but it was probably like as lame I don't that would be the worst if I said that but no they're pretty lame now they're way more um so here's what I tell people I go here's my the mission for the business this first one it's very selfish which is I'm want to work on cool [ __ ] with cool people and have a dope life that's just what I tell people I go so it's very self selfish I just want to work with cool people on interesting things and that's more so the mission than anything and then it's like and if we are able to do this this and this that will also be cool um versus a far more Grand thing my mission statements aren't nearly as Grand are yours I'm in the exact same bucket so definitely used to be like changing the Status Quo you know on my Steve Jobs [ __ ] and you know because that's who you looked up to looked up to Steve Jobs looked up to Elon Musk and he's like you know create an inter planetary species it's like oh okay cool uh what's my version of that like you I'm I'm not trying to get to Mars and like make humankind uh you know interplanetary but I was trying to do that do but you remember that story of Steve Jobs where he's trying to recruit the guy from Pepsi and Steve Jobs is like you're just gonna sell sugar water for the rest of your life right [ __ ] you Steve what a dick now we're like Logan Paul genius puts sugar in water sells it to children dude the audacity so I'm like you now uh I here was here was the notes I wrote on my answer for this uh my on my little Chichi I wrote I don't Kid myself anymore I'm honest I'm building a lifestyle business for me and my team almost exactly what you just said which is I want to do dope [ __ ] with cool people right so do cool [ __ ] with cool people and in a way that leads to an awesome lifestyle meaning I'm not trying to kill myself currently running the business and I'm trying to have a financial outcome for me and my team that lets us all Elevate our lifestyles right like that's that is the this business is a vehicle to have an enjoyable lifestyle which is really funny because in Silicon Valley lifestyle business is the um it's the equivalent of saying no offense uh to start a sentence it's like lifestyle business is how VCS Pat you on the head and say that's cute uh oh oh one million of Revenue that that's cute you know you know we we we don't invest in lifestyle businesses right if this is just a lifestyle business for you we're not interested right your your low ambition which in Silicon Valley is where I live is low status however for me I feel like I broke out of the Matrix and I was like wait what the [ __ ] are all these people talking about the point of life is to have a great lifestyle what I don't want another I don't want to do something else with my life I'm not trying to have a bad life I'm trying to have a good life for me for my family for my team we all want the good life okay let's do a project that's fun and interesting with fun and interesting people in a way that we all get rich is that so much to ask and so like that is now the blanket mission statement on all of my projects and um I don't know if that's inspiring to the Troops but it's inspiring to me and I hope that it just attracts people who are down with that and not looking for the uh the Rah you know save the world I actually think I think that is a bit inspiring to be honest to like the right type of person um and uh I I at least when I talk to people it seems like yeah that sounds wonderful another thing that changed with me is when I start new companies I pick business models where I can afford to pay hires a lot of money because I remember when I was starting a lot of my stuff I'm like man I don't H I can only I I don't have enough money to pay a high quality person a lot of money I it's a trap yeah I'm like I wish I could afford to pay someone three or $2 $100,000 a year so I could recruit a certain type of person so I could spend time with them um and so that has changed as well well like what's an example so like the traditionally you know media companies uh when they start obviously they don't make a ton of Revenue you're putting out free content um and writers are typically not that well paid however like so would that count as it was more in the towards the bad end of the spectrum or was it on the good end because you did hire people like Steph Smith and Trung and H great people eventually I hired great people eventually but like for example um a good media like you could you could run your media company a few different ways you could particularly for sellers for ad sales people you could pay them 60 Grand a year and say they have a quota of only $400,000 and they get they make 105 Grand when they hit their On Target earnings or you could go hire someone who you're going to pay $200,000 base plus a higher commission and their expectation is that they're going to sell two or $3 million worth of stuff and typically those people who are more competent and capable I find are more enjoyable to be around and so like things like that where I'm building a business that hires less people who I pay more because that setup I think is more enjoyable so I had the same problem because my first business was in the restaurant industry and the restaurant industry is basically like you know what is what is the worst type of business you could you could select it's probably I don't know if it's the worst but it's down there it's hanging out with the worst whatever it is right so almost all of them fail um even when they succeed they have like 10% net margins typically and you got to open up like multiple locations to get to ever make it big or have enough cash flow from a business like that to higher high quality like you know highly seasoned people and so I remember meeting the guy who ran Chipotle I think he was the CEO or COO of Chipotle at the time and we were trying to create the Chipotle of sushi and I was like all right you know like give me your advice I didn't even know what question to ask but I was like give me your advice and he's like well think of it this way your entire product is in the hands of somebody who makes $9 an hour and doesn't want to be there and and every C everything you're telling me right now about how great the user experience is going to be that's true for restaurant 1 it might be true for restaurants 2 and three by restaurant 4 it's no longer true because you're not there anymore uh to do the all those amazing things and give that amazing user experience he goes the trick in this business is whoever can figure out how to get minimum wage employees to give somebody a good experience uh they you get you get to win that's the winning condition he goes so you know for like Chipotle we ended up doing a bunch of things to try try to improve that he's like you know I don't know if we did it fully but like they did a couple things like for example if anybody if you're a manager at Chipotle and anyone you manage becomes a manager of a restaurant you get $10,000 whether you work at that company or not just like ever it's like you had a hand in oh that's sick and leading that person to be a to I don't know if they still do this but at the time they did um they also changed the title so like their manager was called like restaurant tour or something like that and they paid them above market and they're like you know we're doing all these things to try to fix it Starbucks did the same thing giving people benefits so that they stick around and actually stick with the job versus really high churn but nobody's really figured that out point is I remember it just wasn't a lot of fun to be in that business because I couldn't relate you know all the things I love I'm an entrepreneur I'm thinking about ideas or um you know raising capital I got big goals Big Dreams and I'm coming into work every day with somebody whose goal and dream is to get off work early that is the like there that would be the the best thing that could H happen to them at work that day and I was like [ __ ] that's not that inspiring every day to like kind of and I don't mean that to knock anybody it's just the truth it's like you you're going to hang around certain people when you run a business ideally you would be around people who are very very like-minded to you in the sense of they share similar values and goals and aspirations and then it becomes contagious and then they're sharing learnings with you and like I remember we interviewed I remember we were interviewing people for like this position because we kept having people flake out they would just leave or they would steal or stuff like that and like my buddy who was interviewing he goes well I like this person um they had all their teeth I was like what and he's like I don't know he's like I'm I'm just looking for symbols I just he's like the last three people stole from us and that sucked I just want somebody's not going to steal from us like that's my new bar first and like after that I could figure out a higher higher level requirements and so did you see on um did you see on the TV show bear where they hire this you know this guy and on the first day they catch him outside smoking crack and they're like I think I need to fire you but I I should go but I should go ask yeah he's like yes chef fire him yeah and by the way there's one lesson in there which is my dad told me something he goes look uh you're building a small business and he goes but look but think about it you're still spending like every waking moment thinking about how to make this thing successful he goes if you worked on a big business you don't have to spend double the hours you're still going to spend every waking moment trying to think of how to make it successful a big business and a small business both take the same amount of time why would you choose a small business and that to me was the right advice for me for who I was that's not the right advice for everybody but like somebody out there needs to hear that right now which is that like this idea that a a small thing is somehow easier or or less painful it's just not true it is not true and it it feels nice to be able to like pay people a lot of money or hire a certain type of person that makes your day-to-day far more enjoyable um talk about the naming thing my opinion has changed on that to align with yours so one one thing we have here is branding or naming at the beginning so um I evolved My Philosophy so I I used to try to get the whole thing right right away I was very precious about my idea and I wanted it to my baby to be cute and be ready for its first day of school and then I realized that nobody cares about my baby and I have no customers and nobody's paying attention this thing could be called dog crap you know it doesn't matter uh until it matters and so now here's the balance that I figured out for me um in most cases I try to get the name right off the bat cuz changing the name is kind of annoying you lose the brand recognition um and I tried to get the trademark CU I made that mistake before of not owning my trademark and having to change my name a year or two in because I realized oh I'll never be able to sell this without owning the trademark and so that was a big mistake uh but I don't know if that's true dude what do you mean I don't own I I sold the hustle without owning that trademark you didn't own a trademark for the hustle as a media company you didn't own anything because I know they have it now we looked it up they have it now but but what happens is if they look and they see that they can't get it cuz it's taken now you have a problem now you're either going to get negotiated down is that true I see I didn't even know that like when Moyes was selling native deodorant he didn't own the trademark and it was an issue he's got the deal done and they're like wait you don't have the trademark he's like yeah but there's no other native deodorant they're like okay Junior what are you talking about that's not how this works um you know and so then he's like okay uh who the he's like I'll just go file for it they're like nope it's taken by some guy some woman or some guy sitting in Palo Alto doing nothing just squatting on it and he goes to that person he's like hey like the trademark he tells the story on on his episode of the Pod I think is like one of the first 10 episodes of this podcast but the short version is he goes and he offers the person some like you know he's like hey can I have it and they're like no and he's like okay I'll buy it like you know for two grand and they're like no and then they figured out that he's selling his company and then that the price went like way up and I think he ended up having to buy it for like either like A4 million or like one or two million you had to buy the trademark at the last minute that's so you know fine when you're he's selling the company for 100 million but like very painful process um you know to to do that better off just having it you taught me something I I thought that they were nonsense but I but I also used to think name I mean look I my company was called The Hustle that's a horrible name one time I had this conference called conon the content conference like I'm I'm I I my first the first business that I started making money online it was called itch juice baby like I like I'm horrible with names um and uh but now I do actually think they're way important before I was like names are [ __ ] it doesn't matter what you call it someone's going to come uh now I'm like on board with naming and branding is is very valuable so I don't think a bad name kills you but a good name lifts you I completely agree I think great design is a huge value ad and costs almost nothing to have great design versus okay to bad design it's not actually more money that it takes it's taste you just have to have the right people to do it you can pay for that taste like you can pay a fancy agency because you know they have the taste but you could also just have taste yourself or find somebody that's cheaper that has taste my feeling on design is I don't start with fancy design I start with like you know whatever simple design and then I set a milestone almost as a reward which is if we get to X then I'm going to Fancy Pants my design cuz it's more for me than it is really for anybody else at that moment um but you know if you're if you're consumer package good or something like that then the packaging obviously super important if you're a SAS tool for whatever your design uh you know doesn't matter as much before I I launched Hampton I paid an agency I found an awesome agency overseas so it was like I think 15 or 20 grand and we did a whole branding thing and I'm like I can't believe I'm doing this and it was totally worth it did I send you that presentation it was did and I liked it um I was like oh this is cool and that's different you wouldn't have you would have never done that before I have I never would have done that it was totally worth it we both were very um cheap with things before I was I wasn't cheap with spending money but I was cheap with my time meaning I placed no value on my time and I think you were cheap with spending money even though you had a bunch of cash in the bank not anymore then when I saw you spend 20K on your branding before and I was like oh that makes sense he's got a killer name for his community Hampton and then he's got like a really classy design that makes it feel elevated which is my word of the year um then I was like oh yeah what are the areas where I've been cheap and one of mine for example was in recruiting so I used to take pride in just recruiting Myself by hand hunting and I would just be like yeah I'm gonna go find people and I'm gonna like message them and I'm G to cold email them and I'm G to convince them and I'm GNA interview them and I'm gonna and now I hire recruiters and I'm like oh for which roles for every role anything if I if I need to hire first thing I do I just text my recruiter this guy Carson I'm like yo Carson I need X and uh he's like a great Ecom recruiter and so I'm like Carson I need I need X and he's like on it and he's like super aggressive and so he's just like instantly will start sending me LinkedIn I'm like yes no yes no he does is he a full-time employee or do you just he just he's got his own agency um he's his own recruit he's his own solo shop and so um so I use him to hire for these roles and it just saves a ton of time and then I'm able to and I have him sometimes I'll be like yo join this call so that you see what I ask so that when you're screening candidates you just ask these questions before me right and I'm getting a way better result using recruiters and yeah you pay the commission when when when you hire the person but like hiring a great person faster is uh is totally worth it so how do you without blowing up this guy at Carson's spot how do you pay him do you pay him a percentage same as all recruiters you pay a percentage of their first year salary and if they don't and then do you pay them like six months later uh I pay them up I think what I do with him is I pay him like 30 days after they join but if they don't work out like like we had one person didn't didn't work out three months in so if if they don't make it three months then he just reimburses or credits it back or whatever and then do you um do you do it for all like even an entry level position everything anything I need anything I need now I'm like what whatever I would spend the time doing this guy is going to spend all of his time doing and um so it just moves faster and he's better and I'm like why the [ __ ] wasn't I using recruit I used to used to take pride and I was like what am I trying to save here the like you know let's say you hire somebody for 100 grand let's say the recruiter fee might be 15 or 20 % so you're going to pay 15 or 20 grand that's a lot of money yes but I do it my bu if your business is working then it makes total sense to be using recruiters to increase your pipeline and and save time and get the get good butts and seats faster versus trying to do it yourself that's time you're not focused on the business that takes longer uh the biggest thing that's changed with me with hiring is um reference checks so like for example I uh messaged someone two days ago I go hey I'm thinking about um hiring this one person uh do you think that they'd be decent at managing a small team and it says I don't think they could manage anyone let alone themselves that was the reply and my reply to my my reply to that was uh all right thanks and I don't hire that person like it's your rep to that should be thank you so much what's your address I'm sending you something because most reference checks will not give you honesty the when somebody goes out on Lim is actually like yo let me save you some pain here and give you my honest truth even though it doesn't feel good to take opportunity away from somebody it's like you sweet baby Jesus thank you so much I I owe you one so like yeah I was like over the top like nice to this guy but uh reference checks are so important and I do two things differently the one I always ask for like three and then I call those three and I go who else did this person work with I don't give a [ __ ] about the three that they give me I'm just trying to like I'm trying to like figure out who I can reference who I can can speak to that they didn't provide but also I won't blow up the applicant spot where if it's like you know it's like someone who I that will be a little bit secretive and not tell their current employer um and then so I do that like crazy and then here's what I ask consistently here's how the basically the point is is I want to hear bad [ __ ] about the person and I want to figure out if the bad stuff is I'm okay with and so I say what are they out of scale one to 10 they always say an eight or a nine and I say all right how can they be a perfect 10 like what's missing and then that's typically when they'll tell me like bad stuff and I'm always looking for that bad stuff and I'm like um well uh you know they've made like mistakes doing X Y and Z it's like okay I could put up with those types of mistakes or they um they um they like Miss deadlines all the time I'm like well I I'm not going to put up with Miss deadlines that's I'm not willing to put up with that so I like I do a [ __ ] ton of reference checks now so someone taught me a good way to do reference checks I don't remember the exact question but it's something along there there's two things that I do on the reference check one is you're just trying to figure out is this person one of the the best people that they worked with at that company and so I'll ask a question I ask the following types of questions I'll say you know my experience is that at every company there's like you could look around the room and there's two or three people inevitably in every single company who like they just have the team on their back and you're just you just look at them you think man if we didn't have this person we would be in a rough spot uh or like you know these things these good things that are happening just probably wouldn't have happened if not for their force of will um and I would be like you know who are the people and I use this to recruit to I'm like who are the people like that at your compy or I'll be like would would you count this person as one of those people and um I I just try to see how much conviction they have of being like oh yeah for sure or like yeah you know they're good right it's like you could say yeah two different ways and I'm looking for which one of those it is the second thing I'll ask is I'll be like um you know I'm thinking about hiring this like I'm leaning towards hiring them uh because I'm kind of trying to disarm them I'm trying to not make them feel like what they say is going to like mess it up but I'll be like but you know but what I don't but I don't feel comfortable with this I don't know what they're not good at and everybody has things they're not good at I'm not sure what I you know like I know that they must have things that are going to disappoint me or going to be uh things that they're not strong at I just don't know them yet what are they for this person so I can kind of feel like I have the full picture before I before I go ahead and pull pull the trigger and hire them and that's how I get them to kind of tell me those things why' you write paid tests what's that so my thing with hiring is uh I would say two things have improved my hiring number one paid tests instead of interviews so I will spend the time I'll spend 3 four hours creating a paid test so I create a doc that's here's a brief and I'll say I'm going to pay you and depending on the role might be two 200 bucks it might be $2,000 I'll pay you to spend a day on this um because I want to see what you do because I just wrote words equal lies it's like I don't really I'd rather just see your work than hear you tell me that you're good at work and so paid tests is now I lean towards that in the end that saved me a ton of time the second thing I did I have a buddy who I let invest in one of my companies that I didn't really need as an investor but I kind of thought I I kind of realized that like as a CEO your job is just decision- making good judgment over and over and over are you the CEO of your Ecom business um no I'm more like a chairman so I'm not act day to-day now but um I will I don't uh so what I'll do is I'm like oh CEO's job is just decision-making or any leader let forget the word CEO just any Leader's job is decision- making how do I get my decision making to be better and like the difference of making 10 to 20% better decisions every single month adds up that that creates a very different outcome so I brought this guy in and I and what I told him I go you know I really want your help hiring and he's like yeah sure I'll you know see if there's anyone in my network I go no no no I want you to do three interviews for this one role for me I'm hiring a CMO and I a chief marketing officer and I think this is the make or break hire for this business I want you on the call and I want you to lead the interview and I want to listen and so we did two things first I would interview them separately you you an investor you you let an investor do that he's my one of my best friends and yes he invested in my company got it uh and he's he's himself a founder and and whatever so he's just got a lot of experience and he I've seen him make great hires and so what happened was I would interview them then he would interview them I would like them he'd be like no trash I'm like what interesting uh what makes you say that what did I like what did you what not like and the thing for him was always like uh yeah I pressed him for specifics and he didn't have any he's like and what I realized was he presses for specifics way more than I was previously doing so I would say like um I would try to figure out do you have experience doing this um you know how would you rate yourself in this tell me a story and they would tell me one story what he would say is like um cool what did the re what was the revenue when you started what was it you know and then how did it grow in the first 18 months and they're like he's like if they don't even know that number then they're out you know if you're if you're CMO you don't know how much of the revenue change from day one to day you know month 12 or whatever you're out then he's like they would say the number he'd be like cool what were the three things that you did that most impacted that and he's like you know if you can't tell me three wins you've had in the three years you've worked there that like most impacted the and then he would say oh you did that thing okay cool can you screen share real quick and just show me like uh you're saying you did this can you just show me how you think about this I want to hear you talk out loud and I was like oh okay there's a different level level of specificity here that I need to be doing in my interviews so a very useful thing was seeing how a master does it so that I could up my game that's kind of an interesting thing because I've changed I did to 180 what was your before what's your after I would create my before is I would create like the most ambitious goals um because it was just like it was like mental masturbation of like just using this spreadsheet and like saying like yeah we're going to 3x this year and five yeah five look at that yeah I'm like I'd be like yeah can you like change that three to a five and change this zero to a nine and like it's like boom we're there all right get after it guys like and I didn't understand that like a they're the one doing the work so it's kind of [ __ ] that I'm like creating these crazy goals that there's no math behind it I also thought that like really ambitious goals were inspiring um I I actually think uh achievable goals are inspiring and I try to hit like 75% of the goals that we set if I'm if I'm not hitting about 80% um my goal setting was quite bad so I I hitting goals hitting hitting goals that are not that ambitious I think gets you a better outcome than missing incredibly ambitious goals I like it creates more momentum I agree with you momentum is momentum is key our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble to together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better my goal thing now um so every time I start a project whether it's a company or inside of a company just like a initiative I got this thing called the kickoff dock it's a onepage doc that I fill out religiously and it's basically like starts with it's just like what are we trying to do here we're trying to do this in plain English what are we trying to do then what does winning look like and this is where I Set uh two goals so I have a floor goal and what I call the FIA goal the floor goal is basically like you know if it was below this I'd be surprised and I'd be a little disappointed and then the FIA goal is what would have us running around here chest bumping being like Oh my God I can't believe it happened and now I have this range and I have kind of like my men and my dream and of course we're going to shoot for the dream but we're going to make sure that we also understand that like a win is a win and anything above this floor is a win and we have the two Targets and we ask ourselves what would it take to get to the floor what would it take to get to the to the to the fbii goal to get to the ceiling and so that's the first thing I do the second thing I do is I set an anti-g goal learned this from Andrew Wilkinson which was yeah that was smart you could achieve you know you could double Revenue but if I wake up every day and I'm stressed out or if I doubled Revenue but profits went to zero because I spent so much on marketing well then I kind of lost while winning so anti-g goals like you know I'm not trying to work so hard I don't see my kids right like in life I think anti-g goals are really important to counterbalance what and what the specific thing here is what are the understandable traps we could fall into while trying to achieve those goals so for example with this podcast you be like oh I want a double re double downloads great what's a trap you could fall into every day I'm on the algorithm trying to figure out what clickbaity [ __ ] I could do where I'm knocking on neighbors doors asking them how they made their money and then I pants them and then I put a pie in their face like yeah that would do it but I would sell my soul and lose some dignity and not have that much fun doing it so that's like losing while winning so I think anti-g goals are really important I started doing those the next thing on goal setting is I realize that much more important than the goal like it's like I would do these like big bursts where it's like we do this planning and set this goal then like three months later it's like hey what's the goal and then like it's not even on the tip of anyone's tongue and I'm like oh [ __ ] this is backwards like first of all I shouldn't be the one setting the goals um because like you know in Game of Thrones the opening scene where Ned Stark has to like execute the guy and his son is like oh do you have to do this like can't someone else do this and he says no like he who speaks the sentence must swing the sword it's like I can't expect you to go do all the work for some goal I set sitting in my boxers in Excel right like now it's like if I'm going to set a marketing goal I'm going to set it with and really like the CMO has to own that goal they have to know know that that's what they want that that's what they think is achievable um I'm going to push back or hold the standard but they're going to ultimately speak the sentence because they're going to be the ones who swings the sword so I make them do it and then the second thing I do is I enforce that it's how do we keep this top of mind and at the tip of our tongue and that's like creating rituals where we're seeing things daily and weekly that um tracks to it because it's far more important to regularly look at the kpis and ask ask the right questions versus trying to set a great goal once and then never thinking about it or not really looking at it on a religious basis do you lose your temper and yell have you ever made someone cry like an employee have you ever made an employee cry because you've yelled at him not because he no I never yell but uh I've never made them cry because he yell never done that I I've I don't think I've ever yelled no um I could be I could be like kind of I'll I could I'll curse like I'll be like hold on like what the [ __ ] are we doing here right but it's more of that just you never been like you're an idiot you've never insulted someone or beat them up or sure you know just punch them in the face or just rude but I but it's you know there's some finesse to my rudess where it's like a it's a backhanded slap not a front-and slap type of thing there's been many times in the past where I've lost my anger and I'll be really just a huge [ __ ] to someone and uh and uh it's like I deeply regret that not only do I regret that because it was just silly but like so the way that I used to like uh react to bad news is I would um I would yell at people sometimes and I would lose my temper and I would freak out and I realize that that is just so weak for so many that is just a bad one you I I I I come to this I've come to the conclusion I can't change people so if I think someone is just repeatedly not screwing up I I just I shouldn't have hired them I made that mistake I someone is either great you you're normally a great executor who sometimes makes mistakes or you're just never going to change and you're just not good like I think losers exist and I don't want to surround myself with them um that's kind of like my my attitude like your sign it's like a a store that's like you know no shoes no shirt no service it's like losers exist we must avoid them like keep them out yeah like I think that that's real uh like losers exist and sometimes I've been a loser I tweeted this out when I was working at twitch I go like right after I left twitch I think I tweeted this out I go well you know uh seems to be a pattern you know basic there's a pattern now which is that when someone's great odds are they're great kind of right away like um of course there are exceptions but I would say the general rule is that the best people I've ever hired it's pretty obvious within 34 weeks that they're amazing and then they just stay amazing and of the people that were late bloomers the key there was just the the only consistent pattern I found was I hired somebody before I even understood what role they should have or what the role is and like when they had an undefined role they didn't really do very well but then when I defined a role for them and I said look this is what you got to do they performed and what I found is that when I have a defined role for someone and they're not very good it never never really changes for me yeah you can't change him you can't change people and I used to be I used to lose my temper and I would like curse and I would and I definitely made people feel stupid and that was that's such a bad mistake because uh a that's just wrong that's just not how you should treat people but B that I'm not going to get my desired outcome they're not going to change exactly I I I still suck at that I would be honest I'm not like a yeller but I can make people feel small and I kind of realized this the other day I was like in every interaction you're either going to walk away like you're going to leave someone and they're either going to feel a little bit like they're going to feel either smaller or bigger based on how that interaction went how you treated them and I was like damn I I think I've make people feel small a lot and you know I'm I think I'm doing it in service of like we're doing dumb [ __ ] we need to do the right thing but I'm definitely not like I've seen people who are really good at still getting the thing done without ever making people feel small and I want to learn that Jedi who's an example who's an example of someone who does that um our buddy suly I think is pretty good at that I don't know what he's like inside of a company but like I've seen him kind of like as a advisor type of guy and um I know what he's thinking in the moment I'm like oh man he's got to looking at this being like what in the actual [ __ ] is going on here but that's not what comes out of his mouth and he will finesse his way there and I don't think it's because he's a Kinder nicer person I think it's cuz the last thing you said which was I think he's realized that's not how you get to your desired outcome um that's not how you get the desired outcome not at all uh exactly so so I think that that's a that's definitely a uh an area to to improve in fact like the one time I did make somebody cry is when I was firing somebody and I realized in that moment I was like like oh he's not crying cuz he's sad that he's getting fired obviously there's that part of it but he's very surprised and that's on me like um I was too scared to be clear upfront that hey this isn't going the way we need it to go and it's got to go differently and here's what the level is and this is not like this currently not at the level and so I W I avoided that tough conversation there and now I'm having a tougher conversation because I avoided that one how many people have you fired uh I don't know like 20 really yeah that's that's a lot right I don't know I've been going for 16 years like you one a year it's not not not that not that much I've not fired that many people I'm such a punk so there's a story about Dave port there's a story about Dave poroy and uh like Dave porno is like I don't fire people like it's impossible to get fired by me I ra I'll just pay you and you just are lazy and a bum and I'll just make fun of you and it's good content I kind of feel the same way I suck at firing I uh I have a good script I basically say like right off the bat I go all right this conversation is going to stink but I'm firing you today and we could talk about why if you want um now I don't even say why I'm just like this isn't working out because it doesn't benefit me to say why it only hurts you because I can sue you but uh I'm horrible at firing people like I I like I'm such a punk I like I I I hate having that conversation that I avoid it yeah but it's just like anything else like you just stretch the pain out longer versus rip the key is and I say this because everybody who but every manager everybody who becomes a manager of any people like don't worry you suck everybody sucks as a manager at the beginning nobody is naturally just like an amazing manager right off the bat it is a learned skill and uh the key to firing though if you learn nothing else about firing uh is in the first 10 seconds you need to say the news just do not beat around the bush uh you know the reason we're here today is because we're going to let you go and um you know that has to come out of your mouth in the first t seconds and if you say anything else in the first 10 seconds just realize you're being a complete [ __ ] cuz uh when it does come and they realize wait what were you just saying all that stuff about why didn't what and you're going to Blindside them in a much worse way it's it's key absolutely key um I have a couple other areas I want to ask you about one is I think probably the key to making [ __ ] work keeping things simple and focused so knowing what to say yes to and what to say no to do you have anything that you actually do to make that to like do that better now I think that I'm so good at focus and I'm bad at it I've missed a lot of interesting opportunities but by default I say no to everything and it's actually cost me um a bunch um like for example um at the hustle we thought about launching multiple newsletters and I was like nope we're just going to do this one thing we're going to do it well because Scott bsky told me to focus and to only do this one thing so I'm literally going to say no to everything and our competitor did and they scaled the revenue significantly faster so I said no to Too Much actually but um my my default was just I'm gonna say no to everything that's interesting I'm the opposite I'm a shiny object you know syndrome kind of guy and so by the way the hustle didn't we didn't even have an Instagram handle until like four years in like I like I was like no we're not going to do social media we're doing nothing it was like we're doing nothing we're just going to do this one stupid newsletter all the time lunch no dude one of my biggest one of my speaking of by the way I used to be really cheap one of deep in my soul the thing that hurts me most is one time I bought all the supplies from Costco for a conference and I ended up returning $2,000 worth of like canned soda and stuff and like the lady at the front desk was like you're pathetic because I was like what and she's like you know we throw all this stuff away is this just some from some party that you threw and it was like my answer was even worse which was like no it's for a business conference that made a lot of money and like and like it hurts my soul that I was so cheap that I returned open cans of soda to Costco for $2,000 it that like crushes me like like the 24 like the 24 case was like uh things yeah and and like I was like I can't believe that was such a punk move I can't believe I did that uh that's one of my biggest regrets that's next to this one time I tipped this taxi driver and he said oh no you don't need to do this and I said oh no you need it instead of you earned it like those two things are like the two things that like Crush my soul I'm like I can't believe I said that um but what what what were you saying you were talking about um focus what were you talking about Focus [ __ ] a focus as we get back on track um I create I I now have a thing which is I I create a a a dock for every business every year that's called the big bets doc which is basically like we we are going to make some bets this year we're going to do some things um but let's be super um conscious about what we're saying yes to and what we're saying no to so my big bet stock and I'll literally write it like this I'll say something like we uh bet number one um we really suck at inventory management today forecasting is just me looking at the spreadsheet and making up numbers based on what I hope happens uh I know there's probably a smarter way to do this other people certainly have solved this problem um I need to figure out how to hire people who know how to do this so the bet is I'm going to hire two people and that's going to lower our waste from X to Y and I write a sentence like that and then that's my bet I'm going to make this higher for this outcome because of this problem and I write a bet number two um you know you keep talking about businesses though are you what how many are you what how many well like I I would do this even for the podcast right like big bets right um hiring Ari okay why why why did you do this why did you make this bet or we just launched the clips Channel okay why am I going through this effort where I'm sitting here clipping my favorite parts of podcasts because I hope that somebody out there wants just listen to the best parts on YouTube when they come up because that's how I like to listen to things and so I'll write it out and I'm like if I'm going to invest my effort my time my money into something uh then I write it out or like you know maybe it's for shepher for Shephard hey here's the bets that we're going to make um and so I'll do this exercise because it's so useful so I write the big bets and it's like here's the three to four big bets that we're going to make the things that we're going to bet on that we're going to do that we're going to invest in and we're going to try to do really really well and then I'll make the no list right before that and the no list I write there are a bunch of other things that we could talk ourselves into doing that are easily justifiable however we're going to say no to these things this year because we want to do the we actually want the things above to happen and then I'll make make the no list here's the things we're not going to do this year that we totally could have talked ourselves into so for me that was a very useful exercise and then when I bring people on everybody I sit down with them with this big bets list I'm like here's what we're doing and then if they're the one responsible for it I'm I treat it like a commercial because I'm like I need to make this memorable I need this person to wake up and remember is it's not just for me to be focused I need my whole team to be focused how do I do that I basically shrink down one of these bets into a almost like a like a slogan or a jingle for their role it's like your your mission is this remember that and I'm going to say that to you probably a hundred times in the next three months and um we're just going to keep checking in on that and that's how I'm going to bonus you is if you did that or not and that's how I'm going to assess your performance is if you did that or not and if I ever if if I ever what's the priority it's that that's the priority and I took this because like Peter teal said that he did this at PayPal he's like yeah I don't know whatever Management's not my favorite thing so here's my shortcut to management everybody at any time has one priority and if you ever try to talk to me about not that priority I will just simply leave the room I thought that was just the visual of that was so funny to me what a [ __ ] weirdo I was like Peter can you can you be normal for what like if someone walked up W stood up and walked away when I was telling telling them about stuff I'm like dude can you just be noral idea about a new program that we could do and he just like drifts away like a hot air balloon what a weirdo man stories there's sto there's stories of Elon doing that too where like in an interview like within 30 seconds he would be like Oh I'm not interested in this person and so he would just hang up yeah he emailed out at Tesla see the laptop closing he was like um if you're in a meeting and in the first few minutes of the meeting you realize that this is not useful to you or to anybody please stand up and leave uh like your time is valuable these meetings are drain and uh vote with your feet just get up and go that is a completely acceptable behavior here at Tesla do you ever send emails with with the one of those emails where the subject is the body of the email yeah of course it's just like a pager basically you're treating it like a pager I had one of the only jobs I ever had my boss sent me an email like that and I was like is this how we send emails and then I I I sent them an email I go what's the status on this this thing and it was in the subject and the reply was don't ever send me an email like this again uh it was I love Emil I I actually I think there are those levels so basically what I realized is that rich people and busy people treat email like texting so their email is like lowercase on their phone on line totally fine that's like their normal way of of emailing and then Mega rich people treat email like it's letters they'll have somebody actually screen them print them out and then they'll kind of like review them at their desk in paper this is like the old school way of of of doing things who do you know who does that I think Mark Lor does that if I had to guess feel like he did tell us that uh Trump does that well no he told us he didn't even own a computer he didn't own a computer yeah but like I i' I've met a couple people one of my old bosses used to do that like he used to print out his important his assistant would print out his important emails and just put them on his desk so that he could like see them and he would just leave a sticky note on them and she would go figure out what to do um I you know I worked for a guy who had four women at the office with giant TV screens just managing his inbound emails and he would just stand and walk around they would be like oh this person said this they pull it up on the screen he would just orally dictate his reply and then he would walk away and then they would just keep managing it it was insane man most of the day I feel like I'm responding to stupid ass messages like on slack Twitter text email it I cannot stand it man it is so hard so I actually think printing out that thing and replying could be kind of cool actually yeah or creating you need some kind of firewall like for me it's like my assistant is the firewall she triages all the emails and then I only check my email for 30 minutes a day like you know cuz it's already taken care of of and if there's something that needed a faster reply she'll tell me she'll text me and then that's it um uh there was one other thing that I was going to share which is um there's a big difference I think that's worth saying which is pre-product Market fit and post so pre-product Market fit what you do versus post is very different I think most of this call has been about post but actually like most of my life has been about before you have product Market fit before you have product Market fit you don't do any of these things you literally just figure out what your product is and you go try to sell it and get customers and then you basically get rejected and you know you handle that and you iterate until you figure out what the product should be and who the customer should be and you've proven how to get product and customers to go up um you to connect and and get more customers like I think that's worth saying too and then after you have figured that out after you have figured out that this product actually has a market and you know how to communicate it to customers you know how to get customers then you hire people ble to like do more of that and I would say like I saw you firsthand with Hampton doing this we're like there was a couple months where you showed me your calendar and it looked like a Jenga Tower it was 20 minute calls stacked on top of each other sometimes overlapping and I was like what is this like where do and you're like yeah I'm trying to go get the members for Hampton I'm trying to figure out what Hampton is and you you sent me like a like a kind of a script or like a landing page you were writing it yourself trying to explain what the benefits are and who it's for and you considered like you know should I take this angle or this angle or this angle and I like would help you like reply on the Google Doc well it's kind of like U it's kind of like being a comedian you know what I'm saying like when when Hassan minhaj finally does his Netflix show he's done 200 before that and you see which angle hits and it's the same thing it's like I got to see which which angle is hitting um someone tweeted out or something they're like um product

you've done a bunch of amazing things we've talked about you on the Pod and we sort of spoke it into existence I think we talked about it somebody might have sent you a clip I'm not sure but you uh you reached out and said hey I'd love to come on you have I'm just going to read a couple of these things so I'm gonna flatter you real quick just so that the audience uh understands kind of just your background so like we said started out uh trying to make it as a rapper and ended up creating a a Jingles company so you were making Jingles for for sports teams ended up selling that and created uh Marquee Jets a fractional jet owning company sold that to Berkshire Hathaway which Warren Buffett obviously runs and owns uh you're married to Sarah Blakely founder of Spanx you are an epic sort of Fitness athlete yourself so uh prolific Runner I read your book uh the day I got really into you was when I read living with a seal which is the story of you living with uh David Goggins for 30 days um I can't even really listen like David Goggins for 30 minutes on a podcast uh so living with it for 30 days respect and um yeah you've created a bunch of companies outside that partner with zico coconut water and doing a bunch of prolific things so you have a a very prolific career but the start was uh like anybody it was humble humble beginnings so talk about the early days when you were you were trying to do the let's start with the jingle company you um you told me you were you were sleeping on couches at the time trying to make it and uh describe kind of what was going on at that time in your life what was the plan and what were you going through how did you come out of that well I grew up in New York in the 80s when rap and hip-hop was starting to emerge in a bigger way and that it that was the intersection of of that happening and me going to college so I was really into music early on and while all my friends and college were writing resumes and going on job interviews I was like I'm making a rap record like I'm why would I waste my time making a resume I want to make an album so it was like kind of that's the direction I wanted to go in uh right away I ended up signing with the record company called delicious vinyl everybody passed on me and this one little record company gave me a shot and I didn't have met like I wasn't super connected I didn't have like a lawyer I know I just did it all I shopped it myself but I ended up getting dropped from the label shortly after and I got into writing um Jingles or uh for companies and theme songs for sports teams and that was kind of my first entree into you know I pivoted it didn't work out for me in the music business but I still loved music so I stayed in there and I started doing jingles and um yeah that's how I kind of started out early on you told me you were sleeping on couches um trying to make it and somebody offered you a tempting deal they said yeah I'll give you ten thousand dollars if I can get ten percent of everything you'll ever make how did that happen and what was your answer right so I was I was writing theme songs for sports teams I was 22 23 years old and my business model was to write a song on spec and then cold call a professional sports team try to get a meeting with them try to like you know get in there and then if I was able to get that meeting convince them that they needed a theme song and that was my business model and at the time I was I was I was bouncing around from couch to couch I wasn't homeless but my friends were I just moved to New York from Los Angeles and my friends were putting me up as I tried to figure out how to do it I had no money to go in the studio to write any more songs on spec so I needed money to fund that production so a music manager said you know I I believe in you I'll give you 10 grand for 10 but I want to own you for the rest of your life basically 10 of anything you make and I was like I'll take it because I needed the money to go with this dude I thought it was a deal in the set tree you're gonna give me 10 grand and all I'm going to do is pay you if I make it like that sounded amazing to me at the time I was living on my friend Melissa Katz uh couch I met her actually at a bar and she had given me her number on a napkin and said if you're in an emergency she asked me where I lived and I said as of Monday I had nowhere to live I was getting kicked out of my friend's house on Monday she said it's an emergency you can come live with my roommate and I Monday my friend kicked me out because his parents were coming for a week and I'm like this is an emergency so I'll just leave to get Melissa's house and I told her about this opportunity and she said well why don't you go talk to my father before you give away 10 of your future earnings and as it turned out her father was a very successful entrepreneur he owned the company called Kenny Park any parking garages in New York and was uh I think the second largest shareholder of the New York Yankees you're like Melissa your apartment is really nice [Laughter] what was amazing about that was it really wasn't and that's why I really was taken aback by I knew her dad was an entrepreneur I didn't know the extent and um should you know she said Me On by the way his name is Lou Katz he passed away a couple of years ago he was an incredibly influential guy in my life and this was my first encounter with them so I went to not the believer this but I went to see him and it's really relevant for anyone listening what he said to me as a 22 year old he I told him my dilemma I'm going to take 10 grand for 10 of my life and he said to me is exactly what he said to me he said Jesse you know will you make this business work without the 10 grand I said Lou I'm on to something I know I can make it work there's a I know I can and he he took his notebook and he literally threw it on the ground and he said I didn't ask you that I didn't ask you can you I said will you there's a big difference between Cad and will I know you can start a podcast I know you can be a millionaire I know you can run a marathon I I said will you son and I said yeah well Lou I will he said well tell him to take the ten thousand dollars and shove it up his ass don't make it work and I did you know like it was a really powerful lesson and like you know what I signed up for this journey as an entrepreneur let me go figure it out let me go that's what I want to do let me go figure this out and he keep breathe he blew that flame into me at an early age and um it's really been a theme throughout my life in all the buckets of my life the whole will verse can notion you know and why why is that so powerful the will verse can well because it's it really puts the pressure you know Billie Jean King in a book pressure's a privilege and it is like entrepreneur we play for pressure showing like as entrepreneurs that's what we want man and um you know I recently did a race called Ultraman it's a 6.2 mile Open Water Swim a 265 mile bike and a 52.4 mile run and I thought to myself before the race that exact thing like I think I can do it but I'm never gonna know unless I sign up for the race put myself in a position where something incredible can happen or not but I got to put myself in that situation and now it's up to me like will I get it done you know will what am I willing to do am I willing to suffer for that one day for to have the next three decades have that in my memory bank and have it on my resume and and I will and I am willing to do that and and I did so you know what's really funny uh after you told me that so I did a call with you the other day to prep for the for the Pod say Hey you know we're going to talk about I'm thinking about talking about this this and this you have any good stories and you told me this this will verse can thing and uh the next day my wife was literally like she's like hey can you take out the trash and I was like no no baby what's that about Canada I will take out the trash and she has no idea what I'm doing and I've been doing it all weekend I've been because it's once you see it it's actually everywhere uh Ben texted Ben who's listening on this thing right now he texted me this morning he's like um he's like hey how'd you eat this weekend we're both like on a fitness kick he's like can you stay locked in from now till Thanksgiving and I just I was like oh Ben you asking if we can we don't ask canned questions anymore as of meeting Jesse yitzler I no longer ask can I it's will I or won't I that's it well think about how many times in your life someone said you you say something that you've done like you know I did you know rim to rim I'll take physical activities or I climb Kilimanjaro and you explain to someone like oh I can do that and I like my in the back of your head you're like yeah you probably can but you know will you do it you know there's just like it's a huge difference between like oh just checking the Box because you said to yourself I can versus actually going through and doing it by the way Jesse I have one other story that you you don't know about uh so you used to go to something at least you went once called coach K's Fantasy Camp is that correct I've been there for uh 18 straight years okay okay perfect that's hilarious so you went to this thing except for those who don't know Coach K he was the the greatest college basketball coach at Duke I went to Duke and um my roommate Trevor used to volunteer at Coach case fantasy camp and volunteer was literally volunteering I was like so what do you you're staying over from brick because it's like during some break and he's like yeah I'm not going home I'm gonna work this thing I'm like cool how much you can pay because he's like I don't think we really get paid but uh you know whatever like you just had put himself in a position for something good to happen and so he and what I did what he didn't know and what I didn't know was the only people who go to this camp that cost like 10 grand to go to are basically like business Ballers trying to like live out their dream of like oh as if I was an athlete and he's he so he all he was doing was driving the shuttle back and forth between where y'all were staying and the thing and he's like dude it's amazing he's like just hearing these conversations what they're talking about in this like nine minute shuttle ride he's like every night he would debrief with me ideas that he heard he's like oh this guy said that he does this this thing over here this guy said he does this and he told me he goes I met this guy super charismatic like this guy he loved this guy's energy he goes and he tipped me 100 bucks for this like 10 minute shuttle ride and late I told him he I told her I was mentioning to him that you're coming on the potty he goes that was the guy who tipped me so I don't know if you remember this or not but we took that tip and uh we had a business idea at the time and we needed to convince this uh famous chef in LA to come fly out and partner with us we had no money and so you you plus a little like side job that I had became the money we paid for for the ticket to fly that guy out which definitely changed the trajectory of our life so little did you know I I love that and um yeah I've been going there for since I'm 35 it's for guys 35 and older and it's not to chase some some crazy Dream It's a combination of you know um meeting amazing people and also kind of like there's not a lot of times I'm 55 so I'm older than you guys and um I can't stop that clock you know at times undefeated it's always ticking it's it's the six days a year or the five days I go there that I get to feel like an eight-year-old again and it's really one of the few times in my life that I get that chance and I love it I don't know man I follow you on Instagram it seems like you live like an eight-year-old a lot of times I'm pretty sure say that I'm pretty I'm pretty sure I just saw you like in an RV with like eight friends just like running around like you yeah it seems like you got the eight-year-old life kind of nailed down I like to give myself that excuse Sam I guess you but you're right it's more than once more than five days a year yeah I I think I think you've done that all right you uh and then it was your first um kind of major business Marquee jet so you went from did you go from Jingles to Jets yeah so interestingly I had so the jingle thing turned into a real business I found that opportunity I started out doing Jingles just for anyone that would pay me anything to do anything so um I was doing Jingles for like I I honestly like turbo bubblegum this like Bubble book gum company that no one ever heard of like just anything that our podcast intro needs a little sprucing up if you wanna if you wanna dust it off yeah I I got you guys and um and then I start and then one of those Jingles gave me an opportunity to write a theme song for the New York Knicks I done a commercial a radio ad for a company called in the in the paint clothing it was owned by um Nancy grunfeld Ernie grunfeld the GM of the Knicks wife and she really liked what we had what I had done and she said um yeah if you have any other ideas you know let me know I said well I love to do something for the next you know like write a theme song and we could shoot a video they can sing it in the arena so I approached the Knicks to do this song called donirco and um the Knicks paid me four thousand dollars to buy the song outright I'll never forget it like um Ashley borrowed money to go in the studio to do this to do the song I didn't have enough money to go in the studio record it because they were paying me 30 or 60 days later and by the time I paid the studio the engineer the lawyer that I had the singer the producer it cost me forty eight hundred dollars to actually deliver the song that they were paying me four thousand dollars for and when I look back on it you know for most people they'd be like that's a terrible business model it was the best business model in the world for me because when you start out you know people buy into stories momentum and people very often more than the products like I was the business plan and I would have paid the next 10 grand to say they were my customer because once I had the Knicks those phone calls to get unto the other sports teams became very easy and that became my calling card so I built a business around that Sean that actually I I ended up doing theme songs for almost every professional sports team and turned it into a business where we were selling CDs like this thought I would think the songs they play in the arena add my original song with great moments in the team history and sell them at retail I sold that company to a public company called sfx and that was my first I was 27 we sold it for four million bucks and then we had there was an earn out for another 12 or 16 or something which we earned out and that was my first kind of like get off the couch moment I was no longer on Melissa's couch and I moved into my own space what was your take home after that I had a partner and at the end of the day I think on the first four million I made like a million and a half but by the way a million and a half dollars to me all the money I was Elon Musk before musk was born I was walking around like I was musk like a million and a half dollars I would owe to the wake up at the eight and go to the ATM I would get my print out of my balance swear to God then I would wake up the next morning and be like are you [ __ ] kidding me I have 300 more dollars than I had yesterday and I was sleeping my partner convinced me to take all 1.3 million dollars that we both cleared after taxes or whatever it was and reinvested to to get like exclusive deals in all this like we made the business being reinvested in the business and actually made the business a lot bigger and we got our earn out and then then everything changed a little bit for me but you know I had no idea how to manage money my parents never talked about money my dad owned the plumbing supply house my mom raised four kids the the thing I had no relationship with money that might sound weird but like people talk about relationships with in terms of their relationship with their kids or their significant other but not in terms of their relationship with time which is very important and your relationship with money which is equally as important I had no relationship with money so when I got money I didn't know how to save it how to spend it how to use it how to act around it I was very immature around new money and you know what happened to me then I lost it because I didn't know anything about it and fortunately I was able to bounce back through having other successful businesses and failures but no one ever told me about it how did you lose it just overspending or what'd you do overspending thinking like oh that was pretty easy man I could just I could do that again you know um what did you buy it wasn't like so much what I bought it was just you know helping my parents spreading it out I wasn't abusive with it like but just I didn't know how to really handle that that's pretty common right like you know Sean and I have a bunch of friends that you know we're both about 34 35 and we have a bunch of friends and ourselves as well who had exits at a young age and the thing about selling a company it's different than there's usually two types of people I've noticed is people who have cash flow businesses or they're like a lawyer or something like that or their own Law Firm something where your like income is going up a nice amount every year and you get used to having that cash flow and then the other group of people are typically young folks who sell their company and typically those people are like me where I paid myself twenty thousand dollars to year one twenty thousand dollars a year two year three was fifty thousand dollars year four I sell it and make a lot of money and you're like this is just overwhelming I don't know what to do with this and that's like a pretty that's like a pretty common thing is I I don't think I don't know if most people blow it but I think it takes about two or three years to accumulate uh and kind of get used to and learn what to do but there's no one to teach you the problem is I I'd always been taught oh if you're a like a millionaire well that ain't [ __ ] was this no but I've been no I've been taught the opposite like if I saw a millionaire that was like the Pinnacle like he's a millionaire man so I always thought like oh I have a million dollars that's all I need to have for the rest of my life I'm a millionaire at 27. and that's that was the relationship that was wrong right yeah you could spend that you could spend that easy yeah you go and you have a four thousand dollar dinner when you were eating when I was basically eating a 99 bagel for 17 years you know things change quick you um I'm a big believer that most of Life most of your life kind of is a result of this the conversation you have with yourself and your head do you remember after you kind of had that first hit and you see the money and you still have you're only 27 you still got all your life ahead of you do you at all remember like the conversation you had with yourself like all right Jesse so like now X and whether X was a good good a good conversation with yourself or misleading one do you remember what what the conversation you had with yourself at that point in time was you know it was interesting because Sean I was living in New York and most of my friends were working on Wall Street they were working at hedge funds they were making they were making a lot of money around there was a lot of money around me and you know it's very easy to get caught up in what's he making versus what am I making and it's very easy to like you start having those conversations with you yourself you can go down and spiral downward very quickly and you know what I was making what it took me years to make and build and sell and my journey to get to that point was crazy I was selling Karen's celery sticks door-to-door that didn't work I had a t-shirt company that didn't work I got dropped from a record label that didn't work I cleaned meat drops that didn't work I sold Chicken shrimp and meat door-to-door that didn't work I mean jingle company I it went on and on so you know I had really worked so hard and and at the same time like I invested so much not for the money but just like I just wanted to get a record deal man I didn't care about the money I just want everyone said you can't do it everybody and it was it was such a driver if I remember I listened to a podcast where one of you guys with Laird Hamilton and you were saying how that he was saying how that you know one of you guys are saying you need that anger to inspire you like some kind of fuel you know so um I had that I still have that don't get me wrong I still have that and I never want to lose that Underdog mentality I never want to be like I'm at the top of the mountain I'm not I consider myself back of the pack everything back of the pack sales back of the pack entrepreneur there's so many better entrepreneurs than me um so many better salesmen than me but I I but I love that feeling of I gotta prove myself so when the money happened it was just like oh Steve Stark is making so much more than me we're in the same basketball run like I got a cash starter you know the um the Marquee jet thing that's interesting though because that's like totally out of left field so and that seems like a a way bigger win than the jingle business same partner right same co-founder yeah same pointer um it was a much bigger win and what like most things in my life um most of the businesses that have that I've been involved with weren't plant you know and most of my successes in life haven't been in my business plan they've been opportunities that presented themselves you know my whole life I've been taught when opportunity knocks you know and I'm not I don't want to sit around waiting for opportunity to knock I like to create my own my own opportunity and I was a guest on a private jet with my partner and I was like you people fly like what is this what is this that I'm on and we alleged to some research like there's only really two or three ways to fly privately back in the 90s when we started Marquee jet you can buy your own airplane if you had 50 million dollars you know or something like that well that's out of the question you could get a fractional being a fractional program like netjets but even that is a really big commitment both in capital and time it's a five-year commitment a lot of money up front that wasn't I mean that wasn't an option for us or you could Charter and there were a lot of questions around well who owns the plane who are the pilots you know do I feel comfortable on that what if the plane doesn't show up so we found the little white space there said you know we only want to fly like 25 hours a year I bet there's a lot of people like us that don't want to own an airplane don't want the responsibility but they just want to be able to have the um have a plane available on short notice and that was the idea around selling a 25 hour check card that will work like a debit card so if if you and if you and Sam Sean flew two hours you'd have 23 hours left and then we partnered with netjet Again part of being an entrepreneur is figuring out how to get from A to B the fastest and for us for me in my life many times it's been through partnership we've partnered with netjets they ended up buying us to use their airplanes partnered with Coca-Cola it's ego at zico Coconut order they ended up buying us um so but anyway that was that's what happened we were guest on the plane and you know walking around eyes wide open looking for opportunities and said wow this could be really interesting and uh and then started the Journey of figuring out how we could pull this off because we had no Aviation experience very little money and you know I was younger than you guys I was 28 29 years old and um figuring out like man we need a lot of airplanes where do we go for airplanes and uh and then started that journey of of building this company so you walk in you walk into netjets and you're like hey uh I'm Jesse former rapper jingle entrepreneur and I would like for you to give me your most valuable assets your planes for this new membership program how did you convince them to do that well at first we didn't they kicked us out of the office in the first meeting after about 12 minutes and um backing that up the bigger question is how we even get in the room forget like what happened at the meeting how in the world did a multi-billion dollar company let two kids that didn't break a thousand on their SATs into a room to pitch them the idea a year before that I was a yes guy my whole life I I was I I've kind of and I still try to pride myself when people ask me for things to deliver if I can but never asked for anything in return you know like I'm not like oh Stan I'll do this for you Sean but like can you do this from like I don't know that's not the mo I got a call a year before that from someone that said that their daughter this is a true story and it's the craziest story ever this guy was having a his daughter was having a sweet 16. and Chris um a famous singer was performing in his hometown his daughter wanted to bring his sweet 16 to the event the guy says I know you know the manager can you help help this guy get some tickets and do anything special turns out I get the guy's daughter as a backup singer for one song with the mic off everyone at school the next day is she's like the hero of this like what happened oh my God they're freaking out the guy calls me up he goes I don't know who you are I don't know what you have what you do but you lit my daughter up and if you ever need anything let me know like turns out he I can't make this up he's the president of that Jets a year later I need 650 airplanes at almost my gym you're never going to believe this the guy you've got your daughter on I have an idea for a thing he gets to me the meeting we get thrown out of the meeting 12 minutes in because they're like we're not giving two kids access to our 650 airplanes and this guy Jim Jacobs comes up to me after the meeting goes you know what that was amazing I said we got thrown out in 12 minutes what do you mean he goes Rich santuli my party he doesn't give anyone 12 minutes because this thought that he'd come back next week and bring this thing to life re-pitch it I need more information so we came back the next week and we realized we could never sell them in a PowerPoint which is like what everyone guy sees 100 power points every year we brought in our own focus group we had eight people in the lobby and they walked in one by one and they stood up and said that they would never buy a fraction of an airplane what netjets was selling but they would buy a 25 hour jet cart and at the end of the meeting they literally said if you guys raise money or put up your own money if you can figure it out we'll give you a shot in a a couple years later we had more customers than that yet that's crazy you showed him the market you were like I could either put up a chart or a pie chart right here or I could literally walk the market into the room and have them say I need this product and it turns out that eight people saying I need this product to your face makes a bigger impact than a pie chart that says 11 of the market needs this when I think back on this moment at 28 years old and we had like Carl Banks from the New York Giants I think Run from Run DMC was there it was right behind me on the wall um you know when he's got that meeting yeah we brought him in we brought him in and when we said when when we they got up one by one and explained why this card would work and you know I think what they realized was they had been pitching to a much older corporate client and that they what they realized I think in the meeting was here are these two 27 year old kids and by the way remember I said people buy into people's stories and momentum this had nothing to do with our product the decision maker looked Us in the eye and said I see enthusiasm I see someone that's no matter what even they even though they have no Aviation experience is going to make this work and I'm willing to bet on these two guys it wasn't there was no PowerPoint it was us like you're the business plan you are the business plan so at the end of the meeting he literally said to us after we got the deal and you know like year one we did I think we did like close to 200 million in sales Year One and I remember going into his office and asking I said Rich santulli who is like he knighted me man he knighted me I said rich how do we how do we end up here man and he looked me dead in the eye and he goes you guys remind me of me when I was 27. and bringing in this Focus Group yes they came in and they explained why they would buy a card and yes they saw a much younger demo that someone could be a lifetime customer now at 25 versus a lifetime customer 50. so they saw the lifetime value of what we were bringing in this younger generation of athlete Entertainer you know young Mogul Etc that they wanted that because that's incredibly valuable to get that person on their plane at a young age but at the end of the day they he saw something in my penny and I my partner and I that he wanted a bet on and you know I just want to say this for anyone listening here because I know this is primarily a business podcast by the way it took me 37 minutes to warm up but now I'm fully here he's here I'm saying but I got it now um you know like I said that was never in our business plan oh we're gonna bring in our own focus group to start a company that does 5 billion in sales it's like it's the things that live off the business plan that make the biggest difference and when you have a chance you know you don't get a lot of big meetings like that and I remember at 27 walking in there and saying to my partner like this is as big as a guess because you know what there is no one else that is 650 airplanes this is it and um you have to bring that meeting to life you have to stand out you have to you know not in a gimmicky way but you have to make that memorable man and and fortunately we were able to do that and it worked and then we had an amazing amazingly fruitful relationship and partnership with netjets until we exited our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right everyone a quick break you're listening to this episode you've maybe listen to a bunch of MFM episodes we get a lot of interesting insights and the reason we get insights is I have a lot of peers and friends who are CEOs of companies and I'm able to ask them all types of different questions and it all started because I used to run this event called hustlecon and I would like convince these speakers of big startups you know you've probably heard of most of these companies the founder of grammarly we work Away Travel Casper all these cool companies and I would sit in a green room with them and I would hear all these amazing stories but I would also be able to learn like how to fire someone effectively how to how to handle things when the business isn't going well how to handle things when it's going great like all these stuff that happens behind closed doors and it changed my life and so I started this company it's called Hampton joinhampton.com is the URL where we make it really easy to have a peer group and have a network of other entrepreneurs that are like you similar Industries similar size companies and so if you do run a company check it out the average company is doing about 25 million in Revenue some companies go all the way up to two three four hundred million in revenue and they're publicly traded others are a little bit smaller and the one two three four range but my partner and I Joe we review every single interview and we hand carry and hand select all these interesting people so it's been a really wonderful community so if you want to be a little less lonely if you want to find information and insights that you can't Google check it out it's Hampton that's the name of the company and joinhampton.com is the URL so you should check it out I review all the interviews so uh enjoy the rest of the episode are you um so like I I I think that all three of us might be a a bit similar in in business relationships where we're like we bring the passion and some of the creativity and the zero to one stuff were you good at running that company or were you or did you have a good partner who is running it and you were great at kind of bringing some of the deals to fruition I can only run marathons I can't run any business I'm not good at running anything no I'm a terrible operator I'm a terrible manager but I'm really good at knowing that I'm terrible at that and being okay with it so you know we were able to hire a CEO right away um and then which allowed me to focus on sales which I was which I was better at Buzz which I was really good before the ins before Instagram I'm not so good at the up now with Instagram but back when there was no Instagram I was good at creating priable opportunities and and talk worthy events and um for my hero that was really important so no um I have never I've never been the CEO of a business I've never ran or operated business but I've been a Founder I think five times and how'd that model work is it like a Costco model where you were breaking even on the 200 million in sales but you made money off the uh a membership no so we the original deal with netjets was we were leasing time on their planes but I wouldn't have to we wouldn't have to enter into a long-term lease until we sold it so we had no rest they were carrying all the paper so if I bought if you and if Sam Sean you guys bought 100 hours we go by 100 hours and it was marked up so we were just a marketing organization they owned and operated the planes and we were releasing it as we got big all of a sudden you know we have four thousand members were doing a billion dollars a year then the model changed and we had to start buying our airplanes but by that time we had you know significant cash and we were able to do that so it started off with literally it was an incredible deal for us and for that um it was a true um no lose for both parties and those headline numbers are really big how big was that exit I mean that's a that's a pretty big thing how big is netjets I don't even know uh I don't even remember what netjet sold to Berkshire for I'm sure it's public this was before Berkshire owned it is that right that just sold at the Berkshire prior to us and then and then we went to now we're part of that part of Nashville which is your Berkshire stock because that would have been a good stock to just get in the deal I know right no we didn't netjets sold for 7.25 725 million and 98. and half of it was paid in stock so that was um if if that was a good deal for netjets depending on if I don't know what the revenue was but that's a lot of money you um you snapped your fingers and you were like uh we did first year we did whatever I forgot what you said 200 million or something 200. I don't know what that means what is 200 million there that's not that can't be membership dudes that's that would be insane no it did yeah no because there are our average our average customer spent close I think it was 250 or 235 000 a year gotcha okay but and it's more like uh gmv so because you have to so your take is some spread between that and then whatever okay gotcha so yeah I guess like on on that model what's the income on 200 let's just say 100 million what what can your profit be on that well this is 30 years ago so how about I don't remember exactly what it was but it was enough that I was now off the couch and living a very good life and uh and by the way the best Roi in that deal is I met my wife there she was a customer of ours and that's how I met my wife um you you said you told me something which was about getting the first customers so before your wife was even a customer uh you know you're like I'm on this plane I'm like holy [ __ ] this is an amazing way to fly I'd love to do this I'm sure other people would love to do this you come up with the idea cool now how do you go get those first people to give you two hundred thousand dollars to be a part of this right that's like a huge like where did you go find those customers and and tell the story of kind of how you got it off the ground well we were start we started out you know I think the first thing that any entreprene most entrepreneurs is at least in our position and more keychain is we had to establish credibility because if I was going to sell you time on a plane and you said who flies with who flies with you guys that would be my first question or one of them and I said well my dad and my next door neighbor you probably would leave but if I was like you know Oprah Bill Clinton you'd be like wow they must have vetted this you know so we started out looking for athletes entertainers and and high profile people um which was not easy for me um but I had to go where wealthy people congregated and I heard about this you know they could afford time on the jet I heard about a conference in Monterey California that was just getting some traction called tent so I flew out to Monterey and um you know I told the guys like hey I'm gonna go get my first sale I'm going to the thing called a TED Talk they were like what it's in Monterey California you gotta like you can't even get there you have to like as connected through Chicago into whatever rented a car five hours of Monterey I get to the 10. it's like Fort Knox man everybody has a credential like this like huge and I'm like you need a credential to get in here there's no credentials to be found so I'm thinking like how am I gonna sneak in buy someone's pass like go into the room where all the qualified leads are I'm in this coffee shop plotting like you know my my entrance or how I'm gonna do it and every two hours the wave of people come in and they're buying they have these credentials I'm like oh this is where they come on their break and they're all buying lattes and muffins and these lattes and muffins and whatever lattes and muffins so the next morning I got up at five and I bought all the muffins from this I controlled all the muffin inventory in Monterey California and I literally just waited in this is a True Story by the way and it's it's been verified you can walk so two hours later this guy uh the first wave of people on the break walk in and the guy orders a latte and a muffin I stop them uh they tell them that they could give them a latte but they're all out of muffins It's like [ __ ] nine in the morning it's like you're out of muffins the guy starts walking I stop I'm like sorry I overheard you I actually have an extra muffin if you want a muffin and uh he's like you got an extra muffin I'm thinking like I got every single [ __ ] Muppet under the table man what do you need and um I started talking to him he's like you know what are you I'm here for the conference I'm like me too what do you do I tell them what I do he said you gotta be kidding me I'm in the market for a private jet cart and his name is Josh koppelman he owned a company called half.com famous VC right now he is I bumped into him like three years ago at uh at a retreat and and we were we were talking about this and anyway he was my first sale he was my first Dale and and that is not a story of me being a good sales rep because like I said I am truly back of the pack but it is an example of me putting myself in a situation will verse can of putting myself in a situation where I could attract that kind of luck you know and and um he was my first sale though she wanted to answer your question and and you know what happened after that I'm gonna tell you what happened after that I service the hell out of them I did what everybody listening would do but I did 30 more so when he went to Mexico he expected me to return his call and the every em DM and all that of course I did what everyone here would do but he went to Mexico he didn't expect a list of Pediatricians that I've added in case his kids got sick he didn't expect me to make reservations every Wednesday at every night at eight o'clock during spring break in Mexico in case he and his wife wanted to go to dinner and and and after a couple of months of doing that what he didn't expect me to do he gave me the magic word he gave me a referral and that was rinse and repeat for for five years until we grew this so no I was never the CEO I was never the the operator I was never the CEO I was I wasn't even I don't even think I was on the org chart so I'm I'm looking at your check this out well you're on the website I'm looking at I use web archive I'm looking at the uh the 2005 version of marqueejet.com and I'm looking at your about page and what's interesting it looks like your senior executive team was not only awesome it was like amazing because Ken Austin I see was your executive VP is that the same Ken Austin that went and started is it Avion the tequila company and most recently started proper 12 with Conor McGregor is is that the same Ken Austin and the tequila company with the rock yes you've done a good job of hiring no we were the Boston Celtics man we were the Boston Celtics we from like the old we the Talent at this company was exceptional Ken Austin is an exceptionally I don't it could be them is such a talented Guy and um I learned so much from Ken and you know we had great sales reps and we attracted really good talent because we built a really good culture well it's also a sick product I mean you said you met your wife there it's like that's like the greatest line ever like oh dude you're here at this jet company so I know like you're of someone I know you're someone interesting definitely just so it happens I I work here or I own the company I mean it's like a that's that's a it's a pretty uh wonderful experience I imagine to work at a private jet company it was it really was and you nailed it but the only thing I would say to that is I think there were like 65 private jet companies that put a flag in the ground from when we started to when we sold and I think we were the only one that made money I might be wrong about that but if something some including uh Garrett Camp the guy from Uber he created he tried to do an Uber for jets uh that didn't work out right it's it's very very difficult and if we didn't have netjets as a partner I you know it wouldn't I'm sure it wouldn't have worked as well so a lot a lot things lined up they're the business you did a partnership on was zico coconut water and yeah I think this is interesting because now we're seeing a pattern the first is you're picking businesses in like categories that they're not in the NBA curriculum nobody's thinking about oh sports teams need slogans and CDs that will increase their fandom nobody even realizes that that's a niche that you can go into or to do you know this membership model for private jets nobody's even looking in that area at the time right there's a very few people are even thinking about that Niche it's not common then you go coconut water so now your consumer package Goods in a beverage category that's non-existent really at the time um and I think zico was pretty small when you found it it's not like it had like you know tons of momentum um so talk about two things number one finding these niches like what what is it that you what is your operating philosophy that leads that seems to consistently lead you to these that's the first question and the second is the key partnership that got it off the ground I heard an amazing Matt Damon story I want to hear the full version of it yeah yeah I spent a year trying to figure out how to have my own coconut water company I went to Brazil I went to Jamaica what trying to figure out this is there were no there was no coconut water in the stores that this is I'm gonna so let me back it up even further I was running 100 mile race and I did a lot of trick when I was doing my training I did a lot of research around hydration and nutrition if I'm going to run for arguably 24 hours how many calories do I need to eat drink an hour um how many calories do I need to take in an hour how much fluid ounces do I need to drink an hour how much salt do I need an hour and my research led me to coconut water so I ran this race powered by coconut water and I finished it in 22 hours and 30 minutes when I was done I'm like this is going to be this is the new Gatorade no one knows about this I'm the human guinea pig I'm bringing this to Market you know it's a better option it's all natural one ingredient you know it rains God sends it up a tree we crack it open and we drink it like this is I mean are you kidding me so I spent a year trying to figure it out how to import it and I realized like I did get a 980 on my SAT because I couldn't figure it out but I knew I could market and sell it I knew I could so again same model same formula I took it the idea to Coca-Cola the president of Coke's emerging Brands division um was friends with one of my customers at Marquis Jack he got me a meeting I pitched the meaning uh in the meeting I pitched this idea of coconut water he takes the liking to me but he says we don't buy PowerPoints or Coca-Cola we buy Brands he goes but if you partner with another company or something you know maybe we can then out that's out there that has proved that they can make the product ship the product get it in stores or whatever we'll come in we'll partner with you so I went to zico and that's how we formed the partnership during the meeting the um about a week before I was at um Matt Damon's house and Matt was also a customer of a marquee Jet and I did the things that I did for Josh koppelman with Matt and we became friends and I said to Matt you know he'd asked me if I wanted to spend the night they were going out and I said I'm going to Brazil in a day or two I can't see because what are you doing in Brazil I said I'm starting a coconut water business he's like you got to be kidding he's like I love coconut I have a coconut tree in my backyard he's like I drink he goes if anything happens what you know with this company let me know I may want to get involved a month later in the meeting at Coke like the meeting is going so bad I'm showing this PowerPoint you know like and out of nowhere like I know I had achieved the whole energy I just turned to the president the guy at cooking I'm like you know my partner Matt Damon and I and the guy that team is your partner I said I didn't mention that what are you talking about we go all the way to the one yard line I leave and I call man I'm like man I need a favor he's like I'm like can I come over with the cat can we climb up your tree get a coconut chop it open you know go in the kitchen put a straw in it you know um turn to the camera and say muttar mutar Kent the CEO of coke there's got to be a better way than this he's like all right and I filmed this he filmed this award-winning friggin 35 second short film of him getting a coconut chopping it open and saying there's got to be a better way and and we got the deal and the creek you know what's interesting about that is obviously Who's Gonna Get You know a mega star to come that's not the point it's it goes back to what I said um will you make it work putting yourself in a situation where you can get lucky here's the other pattern Sean you're talking about patterns and making me making yourself stand out and be memorable in a meeting now I stretched it a little with this one but but um but it ended up it ended up working out that's an amazing story that's amazing that's a good one I love that story I love that story you that's wild I like Coke bought it two years later 100 did you uh when you bought did you buy into zico at the time like did you uh was that like yeah and have you made bets that you felt like Financial bets that were risky like you know Elon does this thing where he sort of rolls all the proceeds into the next business and sort of re goes all in each time which is you know probably not advisable to most but like what's your strategy been now that you have some chips to play with do you do you make big Financial bets are you saying no no I'm going to add value strategically do you start things from scratch what do you what do you like to do with the chips that as you accumulate them how do you how have you used that to to your advantage well I realized that I've got as I've gotten older that more isn't better better is better and I really don't make a lot of bets I have four kids um what I'm most proud of Sean in my journey at 55 is that I've been I've I've exited five businesses but I've been able to keep build a family keep my health you know be a really good son to my parents um I have great friends so I really aren't I'm not uh and I'm not using Eli as an example you brought him up not me but I'm not trying to roll everything in or um I'm really proud of what I've been able to do and I'm really proud of the life that I built so I really don't I really say no to Mo I have this thing at this point in my life if it's high aggravation for high reward I'm not doing it if it's and that goes for anything money friends I don't want High aggravating friends I'm on friend reduction right now come on friend reduction Man follow a low aggravation you're doing layoffs you do Zoom calls so people let them know hey I'm sorry we had to make a reduction in in France yeah excuse me Mr David can you stop on my office there's a severance package three more times that's it we need to have a discussion that's correct that's so fun but I'm not trying to you know push you really it's like it's based on in food my enthusiasm for something um how's it going to impact my life meaning like day to day um I walked away from several ideas that I think could be really good because you're like just because you have a good idea it doesn't mean you should do it and I've um Sarah said that to me I had an idea now I see people doing it now about eight years ago I said Sarah I have an idea that's bigger than Marquee jet like Marquis jet was the biggest thing I've done you know and um I walked you through it and she goes that's an incredible idea don't do it what was it I wanted to take commercial this is going back eight years ago so now it might sound like oh well people are doing it now I actually pitched this to a major airline now um it's doing it but I wanted to make commercial travel feel like private travel for people I felt like there was a bit and there still is an opportunity for people that would pay up to fly commercial but they want an experience that's more private so for example if I'm flying from New York to California and I'm by myself and I'm on a global or a Gulf Stream and I'm going round trip that's an expensive flight man that is an expensive flight um where I could just buy a first class ticket for maybe 1500 bucks so instead of let's say that that flight cost me if you chartered it maybe it's gonna cost you let's just say fifty thousand dollars it might be more it might be I have no I don't even know today what it is but I could spend fifty thousand dollars on a private flight which is amazing or I could buy a first class ticket for 1500 bucks I as a fifteen hundred dollar ticket holder would gladly give you another fifteen hundred dollars United American Delta Frontier whoever if you could walk me through a back door and make me feel like Mick Jagger and escort me onto the airplane it through the bath door and um no one was doing it no one was doing it and now they are doing stuff like that and that's smart it's like you like unbundled the private experience it's like okay there's the jet part of it but then there's the walk-on to the plane walk off the plane okay because when once you get on an airplane do you really care yeah it doesn't matter I'm in 1A no one's bothering me in 1A and in some regard the commercial jet is safer you have more amenities so yeah like but I've been on a I flew first class uh from New York to LA one time for like some meeting I would I had never flown first class but I did it because I had was overnight and I had to be ready for a meeting and I get on I was 1A and one B are sitting right next to me with Stephen A Smith and I was like how the [ __ ] do you go to the plane before me and I like looked it up and apparently there is like a private door I guess if you're famous uh what what is that well I think now several Airlines have it and there's services that do it outside of the airlines as independent services but my point is so I had the idea but I also felt like I had the buy side that I could deliver to the airline because you know I'm involved with them with some NBA players and um I'm part owner of the Atlanta Hawks and I so I have I have and my friends are all doing really well that are they're all doing really well I thought we'd want to have this service so I had the idea and a significant part of the buy side to package together to an airline to bring private fires onto their Mothership which is the domestic part of their travel but um but anyway to answer your question so things like that good ideas lucrative but does but for me at that point in my life to put I'd be on I don't know if I have the energy to do it's going to take away from Tuesday's flag football game I'm not doing it and I don't know if I had that if I still have I don't I don't still have that well you you but you can't turn that switch off right because I saw you on Instagram like you know I don't know a year ago or six months ago or something like that and you were like pickles it's yeah you're like uh guys pickles and you know it seemed like you know the guy who was saying coconut water when nobody was talking about coconut water he's talking about pickles so me and me and Ben started paying attention we're like hey what's Jesse it's done with Pickles well okay he's kind of right yeah no Brandon pickle and so describe this pickles opportunity that you see now currently this is present day now right we're done with the past now we're talking present and future um what do you see in the pickle market well like 245 million Americans eat pickles every year it's like 75 of our population eat pickles and again it goes back to the to our running conversation I'm starting to see at races pickles at the con at the at the aid stations they never existed 10 years ago pickle juice never existed 10 years ago at at the aid stations of marathons and your local files yeah so that made my intention was that it has a lot of salt in it when I grew up all my black friends would say that they would drink pickle juice in order to avoid a hangover oh yeah in Russia it's a it's a you know it's a big remedy for hangovers but my point is like it put my antennas up but what is this you know just like when I saw the first thing of coconut water on the Shelf of like what the hell is this I just ran 100 I'm gonna so so I started doing so I started thinking about it and I'm like you know what I can't even name three pickle companies and I I love pickles I don't even know by the way this is the part where he's gonna bring in a focus group of 10 people and he's gonna say okay they have a pickle company and nobody could do it and he's gonna be like that's the business plan well listen so I I researched like the seven best tasting pickles and of the seven best tasting pickles I think it was like uh The Today Show did something you know it's like it's like someone incredible did it um I only knew one cup one of the companies so I'm like if I only known one of this top seven best tasting pickles there's a problem in the marketing of pickles it's a marketing problem and I'm a good marketer so in it that's where it started and I'm like this is a category with no innovation no fun you know 75 percent of Americans eat pickles the average American eats like 10 pounds a year that's more than cereal and I'm like I like it here I like this space I'm a pickle guy too Jesse saying is it Clawson like the big brand is that right I like Clawson I like Mount Olive is it called a valsik or Vlasic I like that company but I think Mount olives is the biggest ones I always get the little ones that look like a witch's toe are you wearing a metal out of the pickle shirt I'm convinced in fact we're texting Mr Beast right now we're we're gonna come into this Market too you you just made a mistake my friend you're we're bringing our our influencers into this Market I I believe you on this opportunity why do that let's just let's get the beast on the phone let's party with the beast beast pickles that's right that's right who thinks about David yeah where's David I need it go get Ben Affleck he seems like a good pickle guy I need to talk about Feast is low aggravation though I only want a low aggravation yeah well I don't know about that one Mount Olive does uh 220 million in Revenue a year privately owned that sounds it sounds doable man sounds like our money right guys yeah yeah I want to thank them very much for holding it for us yeah shoot a text over the CEO of all of them to keep that money warm for us all right we'll be there soon what other ideas you got because I I told you I was saying you know uh you'll get this because you know you're uh you know you're a rap guy when you go on certain shows like The Breakfast Club or sway in the morning there's like an expectation like okay if you come out here you gotta freestyle and we're trying to do that of the business realm where it's like you come out here you got to bring fresh ideas you can't just only talk about your history and you go you tell me you go I got 50 ideas in my top drawer that's all right say no more but you hinted at me by the way uh the the pickle names sound like a rap name sweet gherkin bread and butter kosher dill like this these are all rap names man yeah yeah we're about to have this pickles um all right tell me tell me about this idea you gave me three words I don't know what the idea is but you said ready-made eight ounce drinks what you got in mind yeah so I mean I I've been accumulating ideas in my in my top drawer for 35 years um I love starting thems Sean you know but um yeah that I mean I don't I don't mind by the way if you guys want to rub anyone wants to run with this you can I'll take a one penny royalty I'll give it to charity um you know I think like I go back to Five Hour Energy the brilliest of Five Hour Energy is they took a you know 12 ounce uh energy drink they Shrugged it down to two and a half ounces right that's what five RNG was and why did it work they they only I believe I believe they only are predominantly sold stores that would put it on the countertop when they started out so like it wasn't buried at GNC on the bottom shelf and it was like on the countertop at checkout impulse Buy they were selling 10 million two and a half bottle ounce bottles every week 10 million when I look at when you look around retail at the counter at checkout of retail the countertop is incredibly crowded and if you go to Whole Foods there's gum there's mints there's this there's that there's chocolates Everywhere You Go gas stations there's lottery tickets and then that the only place that I found like where there's open area or liquor stores if you go into a liquor store you don't see the the the the the the self stink you know the stands and the crowded space and all the tchotchkes and stuff that you see at gas stations and at grocery and and other retailers and um I think there's a tremendous opportunity I was gonna call them quickies um to have like ready-made shots same thing as as five like of you lemon drop whatever your favorite Kamikaze ready-made drinks are right at the countertop that are already made fresh ingredients you know where people could just come and grab and go and have a ready-made cocktail that they can bring to tailgates parties Etc I'm not saying it's gonna it's gonna be a great Goose vodka but I see an opportunity and if not that someone should go make a deal and and in a very fragmented okay now you got me thinking Sean now I'm like this wasn't even on my radar here we go it's like the freestyling stuff you were talking about I was playing with that um really even a better idea would be to go liquor stores are that is the most fragmented Market out there they're all Mom and Pops there's no like chain of liquor I mean like you know you go to your local liquor stores like the guy my neighbor owns a liquor store I go there and I get the wine and this and that do a roll up go pay someone for go rent the countertops of all the liquor stores and then go to Nabisco or one of the big boys and be like hey guess what I want ten thousand countertops you want to put your widget there you want to put your [ __ ] widget there keep the money yeah keep the money [Laughter] I love it yeah probably we could probably talk for 15 minutes about the opportunity and come up with 10 ideas around that you know that's where it starts it starts with just like bad idea or better idea the idea exactly exactly uh you're kind of like I think the background of rap I'm not I'm not joking about this I think the the way the brain can sort of like not censor itself and wait till it has a fully formed perfect idea but actually just start to go and then know that oh I'm gonna hop from this to this to this or this and there yeah that'll be the line and that's all I need to do is get to that one that one line I'm gonna show you this too this is this is something I'm selling now this is I don't know are we on are we still on YouTube no or video video This Is by 2024 all planned out this is next year fully almost fully baked what my year looks like my race is what's orange there's a lot of orange on that what does orange stand for orange orange are so when Sarah sold spanked she wanted to do a lot of traveling so this year we committed as a family to go on the road so all the orange as crazy as this looks is all travel wow we're going to Africa we're going to New Zealand but it's all mapped out yellow what's it what's yellow and what's what's green or blue whatever that is yellow on my races and events green is my speaking uh Green is oh birthday is this stuff this thing's dope not blue I wanted to ask you about this because you are super legit as far as like what you've actually been able to accomplish your level of success and you do stuff like this you have like the big ass calendar club or whatever it's like that thing is called big-ass camera that's a product you make it's like a course you have and um I've always surprised that you're doing those things and you know what what's your thought process on like or the running club or the running club like how do you pick projects yeah I mean I think this goes back to the earlier question you asked me about reinvesting in other businesses and stuff like that um how old are you guys how old are you Stan 34. I'm 35. so I got I got two decades on you guys um and but I got I got the most experiential decades I believe on you guys if the 40s and 50s 30s 40s 50s um you know for me there's I'm in a coaching space you know um um I speak a lot I have coaching programs the calendar but even the events that I do the running races and this kind of stuff it all has an element of getting people to do more than they thought to inspire people to do more than they thought they could but but to answer your question and the reason why I just said that is um the gal works with us in our family office was looking at all the businesses and um and asking me like I don't have a sales rep on my payroll I don't I'm not going crazy on the marketing and this and that and it's really word of mouth and she looked at the numbers and she's like you know do you want to scale this and what are you doing why don't you just go do the liquor idea or the airplane idea or this idea or that idea or any of the ideas in your draw and I pulled out my phone and I said Kendall all these are from today all of these messages are for today pick one read it I said I can't and it was like you changed my life or this has really inspired me or you you know I did this or I saw my parents I haven't seen my parents in a long time and you know I talk about the importance of that very often you know about not losing sight of what you already have while you're chasing your entrepreneurial dream your health your family your friends there's no business in the world that would give me the return on investment that I'm getting right now there's nothing I could do what build another Marquee jet work 20 hour days I mean like that's not going to give me that sense of impact Legacy for my kids um and just the feeling quite honestly that I have I mean like it's Indescribable a wire is a wire you get the wire and it's like the same feeling you get when when you sell a business is the same feeling you get when you finish the marathon you walk an old lady across the street or you do anything that makes you feel good about yourself I swear to God and I have the right to say that because I sold five of them I have the right to say that it's the same feeling and for the for for very very for a lot of people chasing that waiting 20 years to sell a business or something to have that feeling when I feel like I get that every single day and that's a really powerful place to be in your life at 55. and and that's the reason man and and so you're right I have these businesses and you know there's no real plan around them people like what you would I don't I don't know I'm just enjoying how it's making me feel right now and what's wrong with that I got a scale just to scale because everyone told me I had to scale I don't want to do that man right I did that so a question that we like to ask people is it's a really simple question but we we learn a lot which is like what do you do with your money so like you have a really interesting lifestyle I agree with you I'm not I don't like the Elon Musk path of uh all these sacrifices and uh um doing things for the sake of humanity I'm like I'd rather have a fun life and you have a really sick life I mean I I I'm I'm a former College athlete Runner so I I like watching what you're doing um and I like to work out and do these podcasts and have a lot more fun than just work what do you do with your money um and um when you're financing it this are you just are you using your speaking fees to finance it and then you have your Marquee jet money in just one big account in the in the markets how's your portfolio set up and what are you doing with your money we'll just you know it's um I don't know man like we we never really think about it that much I know it's I don't want to belittle it or sound in any way a noxious in fact I'm incredibly grateful but like it goes back to the relationship with money from the beginning of the conversation um we're not trying to triple it or quadruple our money like we don't really think about it it's like it's spread out strategically and we live our life what's your monthly burn I mean what what does one need to spend uh per month to do that I like to ride my bike I like to run I like to swim I like to speak in public I like to be around my family and friends what whatever that cost me Sam is what I'm gonna spend on it how's that for an answer yes ma'am uh I want to ask you about something that you have talked about that I really liked which is uh around your life philosophy so you have a few of these that have made an impact on me you um I don't know where I saw some Tick Tock clip or something you were talking about like this three minute daily thing you go three minutes and I forgot exactly how you phrase it but it was like you go I I can Network in three minutes right I I can I can invest in my friends my my network in in just three minutes a day and I'm always interested in anything that's like you know six minute abs I I I tend to be interested in the like you know shorter time frame type things and you go compliments what was the other ones you go compliments um complimenting congratulating explain that that philosophy because I've been doing that now where I I basically go through my text list and I'm like who's somebody I could compliment boom send it out and they love it because they're like uh you know I'm thinking of them we haven't talked in a little while it's really simple for me to do this is like kind of like a actually like a very effective little tip I want you to share with here well in my 20s I didn't have a way to to I had no I was really on it super tight budget I was writing 10 handwritten letters I went a year not every single day but pretty much writing about 10 handwritten letters a day and that was my entire marketing strategy and I realized that you know it's a great way to get through the Clutter of email DMS so you know all this stuff because a lot of people don't check their emails or their assistant does or whatever but everyone reads a handwritten letter so I the three minutes a day is you know I had sent the text you mentioned the K Academy Coach K I sent a uh fluent to Carolina um not too long ago and I said coach a text thanking him for having the event and I said you don't need to respond I just want to let you know like it makes me feel like an eight-year-old for five days a year I want to thank you for for doing this I know you'd have to do it and it took and like I realized like he might share that with his team like we're having an impact like look at look at this note or tell his wife he might do nothing but now if I see Coach K I have permission to go over them and say coach I send you a text like I don't know if you got it but like I have that permission to do it I'm not coming out of left field like oh hey coach you know like well you just so that took me 45 seconds to hit send write it and it's then so I was like okay if I did three of those a day and just took three minutes and just started hitting friends suppliers manufacturers inflict whatever over the course of a year often that thousand I will plant a thousand permission slips all over the country and world three minutes a day so in carpool line when I take my kids to school or pick them up I just fire off a couple of emails or call them or whatever so that was that theory the compliment congratulated consoling is really just kind of three things that I I like to to remind myself to do to maintain and build authentic relationships authentic relationships not relationships authentic relationships so for example if you have somebody in your life that's grieving and you'd all reach out to them and you guys are young but you'll see in the next 10 years friends will start to get diagnosed with stuff parents grandparents are going to pass away like your life's Gonna Change man if you have someone that's grieving and you don't reach out to them they will never forget it build a nip oh you can't human nature you can't even help but take inventory who reached out and who did you're just aware I just lost my father I know everybody that called me I know everybody that didn't call me and the people that didn't call me don't get a pass they don't get a pass so you always want to consult the people that you know something happens to a friend in your life that's great you want to congratulate them you know and then you want to compliment you know Sean man Sam listen you guys have an amazing podcast you did it yourself you know you guys decided to like sold some businesses and here you are you know bringing on aspiring people to inspire entrepreneurs all over the world and um I just want to congratulate you on your success man I'm not you know I you just call someone out of nowhere your default to calls or texts either way I just think I personally like handwritten letters here's one um because I feel like the intent it takes a little longer but to actually get a stamp lick it go to the mailbox put it in the mailbox it's received completely different than just sent but you know so by like in the pecking order but you don't have the ability to do that it takes too long but at the end of the year I do like to write 25 to 50 handwritten thank you letters every year I have a whole closeout the year process that I kind of teach people but like and that's one of them you know but you compliment you graduating console and you do that to people and like if I say I'm if I hit you up God forbid you had something bad and and I don't even know I just met you for the first time other than the question about how my birth rate I love you so if I if I were to follow you up after one meeting and say stand man I heard about XYZ man I'm so sorry that happened to you and then four months later I'll call you up and say sam and you guys just hit 5 million downloads a day congratulations man and then I call you up against the end of the year I said Sam I just want to let you know man that question you asked me about about my burn rate you know I would rethought it and I want to compliment you because you ask the tough questions and you know what that's the seat that you're in and I give you credit for asking questions like that to people on the other end and I really admire you for that I do those three things in that year you're going to think differently about oh you'll be his hero you'll be all of our heroes to be honest with you that'd be incredible all right well Dad Sean you laugh about that when we're laughing about it but let me ask you a question who doesn't want to be a hero you're right who doesn't want to be here we like if you tell me I don't have to run into a building and save save someone I can just do that and I could be a quote unquote hero like you know what I built my career doing that well so this is about relationships you also have others about skill Building Life Experiences explain some of your other kind of Life rules because I think these are really worth sharing you know people I think will be entertained and inspired by the business stories but my hope is that that actually was just buying the right to drop a little wisdom on them at the end here because this is the stuff I've liked the most from you from your story um so so tell talk about you know the sort of musogi or the the Kevin's rule like these are pretty foundational yeah well that goes into kind of the planning that I showed you on the calendar and um I really do do two or three things every year um at the beginning of the year this is actually perfect timing I don't know when this is going to air but like November December when you look into 2024 or the next year I try to have one big year defining thing on my calendar every year last year was my bike ride across America 2015 it was living with the seal the book I wrote 2017 I lived on a monastery 2016 or something I started 29 or 29 this company with my partner so there's an old Japanese ritual called them a sogi and we took the liberty to kind of create our own version of what that means but basically it means that every year you do one or the way I've interpreted it is you do one big year defining thing and you had you should have something to show for it every year by the way if you're 35 years old I don't I don't just rounding up here um and you live to be 85 so you have that would be 50 year defining things between now and the end of year and the end of your run that you have on your life resume that's pretty damn incredible the second thing I do is something I call Kevin's rule named after my friend Kevin um which is every other weekend I do something I normally wouldn't have done it's like instead of watching like a George the Georgia football game I might take my kids fishing I might go to a conference I might you know um watch spend a couple hours learning something I didn't know um I coined at Kevin's rule because Kevin and I were camping in Mount Washington with our kids and it was like I go cab there's eight it's like the winter it's snowing we're sleeping outside in a minus sporty sleeping bag minus 20 sleeping bag I'm like cat there's eight billion people in the world man it's only us on this mountain you know it how often do you do this because he invited me he's like oh every other week he's a police officer I do so every other month I do something I normally went to done I'm like what do you mean he's like so at the end of the year I got six mini Adventures if you're 35 and you live to be 55 and you have six mini Adventures that's 300 mini adventures and 30 50 I'm sorry 50-year defining things you're musogi and 300 mini Adventures Sean I don't care how much money you have or how little money you have at the end of your run if I go to you and you're 85 years old on your deathbed and you're like Jesse man thank you I took your advice listening to my podcast and I now have 50 unbelievable Adventures I've done the Grand Canyon I've taken my family and I have 300 Many Adventures that I've done and by the way it only took six days of the 365 days of the year seven days of the 365 days of the year it's a two percent is that two percent six percent what is that you have a rule here we don't do public math so don't worry you're off the hook okay there we go [Laughter] that's a great rut that's a great run have you ever hung out with Rob Dyrdek you guys are really similar we had him on um and I I think I've said publicly he's one of my favorite people uh and you have the similar quality where you just have a framework and you know what you like and you stick to it and you're really intentional and I appreciate it on your terms which is what I think the highest calling thing we respect on the Pod is somebody who defines their own terms and then lives on them even if you don't even if somebody doesn't even successful people don't do that like even people who are wealthy they're like I [ __ ] hate my life because I'm tied to this job that I actually don't like doing and you're a great example you're you're you're your definition tends to be exciting and awesome because you're doing all these Adventures but it doesn't matter what your your definition of of like your framework is you've done a cool job of defining it and sticking with it and I appreciate that well one cool thing that's different is Rob's is all about maximizing he's like efficiency how much how do I use my time how do I allocate it and how do I get the most done in that time whereas I feel like just sees almost like it's a different relationship with time it's like how do I have the maximum number of of incredible experiences um and amazing relationships and moments whether that moment took five seconds or you know five days or five weeks it doesn't really matter it's like maximizing kind of like squeezing the juice out of out of the fruit you know versus versus uh you know trying to optimize every moment in in a generation of hustle and grind which is so obvious no [ __ ] you gotta work hard that message gets lost and you don't want to give up your 20s and your 30s and your 40s and certainly not your 50s if you can avoid it just grinding and chasing something that you can get the same feeling doing something else well we feel lucky for having having you on uh very early on on the podcast Sam introduced me to a guy Mike Brown and he said one line on the Pod that changed my life he goes uh he goes yeah my theory of life is find the people that you love and then do life with them and I just thought oh if there's a North star for me like that's the new North Star you know maybe something maybe something more wise will come take its place but that's it and uh that's the pie [Music]

what three creators do you see that you think could become billionaires is like Mr Beast dude perfect or something like that and then they said to you no way the algorithm has shined upon Him Cody is one of the biggest YouTubers on the platform doing what you do if you go and listen to my first episode of my podcast it was complete garbage if I'm thinking about like what makes a good podcast or what makes a good YouTube video or what makes a good song the number one thing you can do is how much are you thinking about like the business side of of without being a billionaire when I was younger it was like literally just about the Creator but now that I'm getting older it's like I want the business to succeed and then he looks at his phone he's like elon's been texting me and then he showed us his phone it was like Elon Musk who's like come over you know he was like should we go over to his house yeah I mean you can't really say no to that and so he got in cars and drove to his house we got to his house and him and Grimes are like standing on the driveway with lanterns like welcome to what that's insane what's he like like it was one of those things where we [Music] by the way I

about like what are we gonna like because it's different than our normal episodes right yeah yeah Sam's not here second yeah you're like cool entertainment guy and we're usually like nerdy Tech guys um what'd you think was gonna happen I don't know but I like being the guest on a podcast is so much better than being the host of one right because like it's like that's your right side yeah the pressure's on you I can just sit here and answer questions you know yeah good okay well that's what we're gonna do but the actually the interesting thing is you actually started as a kind of nerdy Tech guy too I did yeah you were uh I think like an iOS Dev yep and let's start there so the origin story is you uh you go to Duke and you you make a viral app at one point I don't know if we were at school or right after school it was anyway I was during college during college I was uh what did it actually do so I know it was called CAP that or I cap that I'd cap that I'd cap that yeah what was the app a very funny name by the way yeah um so it was like I was a senior in college and uh I was on the diving Team all four years so I like didn't have like in the Summers and stuff I was just training and so I never did an internship I didn't have any resume by the time I was a senior and all these all my like peers were doing internships and they had jobs lined up for as soon as I graduated I didn't I had nothing and that kind of scared me because I'm Canadian and I wanted to stay in the states so I needed a Visa which means I needed a job and I also just like needed money and stuff for when I graduated I was like [ __ ] am I gonna do so I was studying computer science at that time and uh they didn't have an iOS class but I was like I was obsessed with my phone obviously and I was like I really want to know how to make an app so I just bought a book taught myself and then like you know the way you really teach yourself something is you sure you can like read and watch YouTube videos but like it's by you know thinking of a project and then trying to make it come to life so that was my project there was one that did something similar but it was a paid app and I was like oh this is a perfect opportunity because it's not a hard idea and what was it so you're captioning yeah like as a meme meme generator basically yeah it was like you would select a picture from your library or take a picture and then it would it had like an internal database of funny captions that we all just like got drunk and came up with and so it would automatically apply one to the picture in white font but like all the captions were sort of General enough where people thought there was like AI going on like what's an example like what do you mean like like I don't know a super one like a stupid one would be like you take a picture of someone in here and it'd be like addicted to cocaine or something like that and people would appreciate that you're like oh he is that's so true he does look like a cokehead and so it and okay so then the way I got it to spread is it got rejected by the Apple review you know board or whatever multiple times and so I was like for being inappropriate so I was like hey how did I can't make this app clean because then it's not funny right and it won't do anything so I basically had the I wrote some code so that the internal database was timed because I knew the app review process took like a week right so then basically after seven days it would release all the dirty captions so I got by the Apple review system amazing and then everyone was like oh my God this app is so wild like look at this like swear words in it and it just blew up it was the number one app in the app store you're just on camera above like eBay and Google and it was number one and I paid zero dollars for marketing right and I'm on campus like I don't know what to do because I know I should be making money from this but I'm not and I have no idea how to make money or anything about business right and I was talking to my friend I was like what do I do and he was like dude you should like sell ads and I was like I don't know how do I even start to do that right like I didn't know the first thing about setting up like a ad SDK or anything and so and you also kind of know your shelf life like you know every day that you're the top is great exactly and it might not be the case 100 days from now when I figure this out and when you blow up that fast the graph goes the other way just as quick right so I was stressing on what to do and I got an email from a CEO of a startup in Palo Alto and he was like Hey saw your app I love it I want to hire you and buy the app and I was like perfect yeah that worked out which was cool for me because like growing up you know being obsessed with apple and Steve Jobs I was like Silicon Valley is like a dream that's where I'd want to end up is this it this is the yes this is it yeah amazing no this is I'd kept that too the sequel so like when this company I surprised you didn't go like dos or something I know right did I tell you this on on my podcast I don't know okay when so I I took a trip to Palo Alto fell in love with it met the team they loved they like you know we just got along great it was a it was a mobile ad SDK company yeah it was a mobile ad Network so they needed my app to drive traffic through the network cool and I needed money and a job right so they like it was you know pretty um mutually beneficial they acquired the app I think it was like for 50k half in cash half in stock which was great for me it was a nice like lump sump yeah get a lump sum sorry to get like a apartment and furniture and stuff and then my first job was to make was to make a sequel that was a paid version oh no actually no the my first job was to make it I cap that plus which was the paid version right and we we launched it and immediately it made 200 Grand and I was like damn it wow damn it you should have just done this by myself you're early to the plus train but there wasn't apple and then we did ESPN plus yeah I haven't patented actually and so then we made I kept that two and then we made I kept that two plus and we just milked this thing how much this do you think the whole generator made like half a million bucks or something like that but then you know then it died yeah but and so you had you had that run of like you're doing that on campus so you got the taste of like the thrill of making something succeeding kind of failing but also succeeding at the same time where was your head at at that point you're like what are you thinking at that moment you're like oh I could just do this again or what was your approach after that like after I got the job just like after you had gone through that experience like did you think of like I'm gonna do this again or what was your it definitely was my first like little taste of independent success so that definitely gave me a little courage um like my plan was okay I'm just gonna State this company and work my ass off and try to try you know do what I can to make this thing a success so that like the stock you know becomes something and that didn't happen um but yeah it was like definitely it gave me my first little taste of success and before that I had never you know had I had never like felt momentum like that before where something's working and the graph is going up and to the right and you're like oh my God I'm onto something right and then you tasted that again when you started doing like content right Vine Vine content was the next time you tasted that like that kind of crazy virality I actually that was more everything since then has been more linear really yeah like I've never been you know you see creators all the time that blow up like out of nowhere like you know this year it was like Alex Earl or something like that sure or um who else like the octopus octopussy kid do you know him no anyways it happens it seems like it sounds promising though he sounds like he's really cool like a gym um he's really funny but for me it was always like I kind of had to grind my way to having an audience right by literally downloading Vine making videos every single day I was I was actually pretty late I would say like the whole first like class of you know like famous Viners had already been a thing like King badge right Brittany furlin they were already like people right that everyone recognized so when I downloaded it I was just like I didn't download it with the intention of like being somebody or you know generating an audience or anything like that I just was I was working on a social media app for this company and it was like Snapchat for video basically and then Snapchat for video came out yeah you're like damn it and so basically I was like just keeping tabs on all the new ones that were coming out and Vine came out so I downloaded it started playing around with it and I lived alone in Palo Alto which has a 21 year old it's the most like boring life imaginable so I would just start making videos I would get home from work and I just all of a sudden like started feeling like I was like flexing my creative muscle and hadn't done that in a long time yeah I felt good so every day I would just make more videos and then it was like getting involved in the community you know like making online friends with the other people that were kind of getting some traction and then I started showing up on the popular page and people started recognizing my face and I just kept doing it like just was genuinely like didn't try to make it a job I just was like programming is my job this is my hobby and I'm gonna treat it like an art right sort of and that that sort of paid off because like people I think people liked the sincerity behind it and you what do you mean by that so like for the people that were let's compare the people that were trying really hard to like become famous on Vine and what you were doing what do you think was different to The Outsider I think like selling out was a much more obvious thing back then or a much more like binary thing whereas now it's like completely expected it's like someone someone takes off and they start doing ad reads and their fans are like yeah get the bag let's go whereas back then it was like first of all six seconds is really hard to endure something in like you can't even say get the bag exactly so it was pretty obvious when people like started making money and then people would be like ah you know you sold out you're not the same right so I think that it helped that I had an actual job on the side that I was making decent money but you got to a couple million followers right yeah yeah I think I'd like yeah I think I had like three or four or something and on Vine I always wondered something like that or maybe two I don't know what happened to Vine I think it was just a little bit ahead of its time because I think now I mean if it came out like five years ago I feel like it would have worked but it was kind of working then and then they just like turned it off I think it was because when Twitter Twitter bought it before yeah they launched then they launched it and it really worked but then like the traffic started tapering off and I think they were at a Crossroads where they were like we can't monetize just just our website right like Twitter was having a really hard time monetizing I think it still is and wasn't there like a meeting with creators where the creators like we want money and Twitter was like nah and then they wasn't there like some famous I remember there was something like that where they yeah I think they like were in a room with like king bash and those people and they were like we want this much money to keep posting and they were like we don't have it right they're like okay yeah yeah yeah so they're like actually we're just gonna shut up shut down the whole thing instead yeah oh okay um so you okay so you go through that you uh you guys have had you've been doing content on like podcast YouTube for like over 10 years probably almost right yeah almost and you said you know it was kind of linear so if I said like what was kind of breakout for you well or like the breakout moments or like things you remember were like oh [ __ ] things just got different for me like I something is different I don't know exactly how how big this is but like something changed I remember I remember the first time that I hit a million views overnight it was like a it was a that's cringe video which was like one of now like wonderful viewed series on my channel and uh I remember like we did a couple and they seem to be working people seem to be into them but it wasn't like apparent how much more people liked them than you know the other stuff that I was doing and then we post like the third or fourth one and I remember waking up to a million views and I was like oh my God that is that was unfathomable for me you know even five months ago right like those numbers just like don't even make sense to me and uh so that was one pretty distinctive moment another one was when we when then me and Noel went on tour for the first time and the second time and all the times after that and the tickets would just like sell out and I was like see that was a moment where I was like I can't believe that this is now converting into Real World Sales where people want to come to a venue and see us in person that felt really cool that's always like a weirdly sobering thing what do you guys do when you do that because we did uh we've done I think we did two live shows this year um both times they like you know people showed up which was like shocking in the moment and afterwards uh but also we were like what the what do they want like what are we supposed to do podcast like you want to just do the podcast in front of you while you're sitting here like yeah I know that's boring I think yeah um and we tried to do a bunch of stuff uh I personally hate it I hate I'm like I don't really want to do that again because like you know your series is called that's cringe that's in my head I was like this is cringe right now what's happening is a little bit cringe what do you guys actually do when you do your live stuff we did uh so like the first couple shows that we did were just uh on stage like podcasts because the same thing we didn't really know and then what do people want to see I'm not sure they're buying tickets for a live pocket 500 people just sitting quietly listening our first show is like a hundred or something like that or whatever there's a crowd of people just watching the podcast yeah and that went well but you guys are funny I think that's the thing they're laughing so it's kind of a comedy show yeah yeah so I think that works but then we so then after that we did another tour where we were like okay we can't we need something that's gonna like guarantee laughs and we really want to want to put effort into this so then we wrote a show and then we started writing songs for the show and it kind of became like a third music a third like live sort of that's cringe that we did on stage gotcha and then a third like just stand-up comedy wow um because Noel was a stand-up before we started doing anything together so he kind of already had jobs and in research for this I saw a video of you doing stand-up what yeah where there's a video oh my God please please do not look that up please for the love of God I do not want to see that on my own channel dude I'm taking that it wasn't that hard for me to do this research by the way what's it like doing stand-up horrifying horrifying the thing is I I DJ Now yeah I've heard and so I like that's in front of people and I find myself like a lot more comfortable obviously because it's not just you and the mic and the audience DJ there's something in between which is already awesome you know it's like music right so you for the live shows you guys are like turning it into like a full yeah by the end of the tour because we did a we we toured the whole world right and we did like I don't know like 100 shows or something like that so by the end it's like we had the show literally word for word scripted and memorized right because when you do it that many times it just becomes the same show and then you like alter it a little bit every time if something ought to laugh you'll add that back for the next one and it kind of evolves so we had Samir from Colin and Samir in here yesterday and I had asked him a question like um I think we said something like you know uh what three creators do you see that you think um like could become billionaires like you talked about Mr Beast great who else who else you think has that pathway or potential and he said he's like Mr Beast uh he said apparently he said dude perfect or something like that and then he said you no way yeah really yeah and I was like that's amazing because he named 50 other YouTubers by the way during the episode that I was like oh cool I never heard of these people because I'm not like in the like I have the things I like and I'm not like YouTube culture I'm not like everywhere on YouTube yeah and I was like dude he's coming in here tomorrow I'm gonna tell him this and see how he reacts and you sound surprised uh I definitely am surprised the thing he said wasn't like he's going to be he's like uh they could he's like it's up to them yeah he's like they totally can if they if they choose to like optimize in that direction they are like the ones who have like the the kind of the audience the intelligence and like the kind of the capability to do stuff there or they might take that energy in a different direction yeah um I also uh I was telling Ben all the way over here I was like I was like I feel like you and Noel could do a uh like Harold and Camargo to White Castle movie yes yeah yeah um so we are working on something I can't really say too much about it but I'm a believer that that's like sewing your guys's wheelhouse I think it'd be a lot of fun I remember aside uh when I was younger I acted in a movie like as a kid like a kid actor of a thing and my older brother in the movie was Cal Penn who is oh yeah so he called me one day and he was like uh hey how's like school going right like I don't even know what I had to say I was like how's your what do you do what are you doing now and he's like oh I'm filming Harold and Camargo to White Castle which to me I didn't even understand what I didn't know what White Castle was there was none where I was at so I thought it was a fantasy movie okay I was like yeah yeah I guess he's like going to some fantasy Epic Castle thing and I remember going to school and tell my friends like yeah why did he call you just checking in on me here's a nice guy he was just saying you were like friends with him after that because like because you were saying like you know when you go on tour you hang out like yeah same thing on a set you just sit there right right nine hours waiting for them to line up the shot yeah do like five minutes of acting then you just sit there again like so he was just checking up on you like what's good yeah he was like what's good man like you know how's your summer going um I don't know anymore he came to speak at Duke actually and I was like I went up on stage and I was like oh I look totally different than like when I was 11. and I was like Yay no that's really funny he seems like a nice guy oh he's Ultra nice uh really nice guy he's also I really like about him is he um he just like grinded super super hard at a time there's like no Indian actors like the only Indian acting jobs he could get was like you're the convenience store guy you're like thick accent and I remember talking to him on set I was like what are you gonna do after this and he's like uh he's like talking to his agent or something and he's just kept turning down roles because he's like they just want me to be the stereotypical Indian guy yeah and I was like um okay cool Sonic what do you do is set he's like I don't have anything and there's no instead I was like so and he's like he's like I have no money and I'm just gonna like I'm gonna just wait till I get a real he's like if I do that I'll never get out of that yeah yeah so I'm just gonna like risk it all and like grind through this period of like not having anything um until I get there that's funny I I took a I've told the story before on my own podcast but I took an acting class one time and they were talking about leaning into your Typecast at the beginning of your career like you have to do what you look like in order to like get your foot in the door right so we did this exercise where we all went around this the circle like this was like a you know room full of students it's like 20 of them and we all had a journal and we would all like one by one look at each other and write down what we thought they looked like and their Typecast was and so like and then we all revealed them basically like one by one they the the teacher would point to one of us and then the rest of the students would read what they wrote about that person so it was like it was like doctor scientists you know and it was like uh you know race car driver cool [ __ ] and then it gets to me and they're like influencer cokehead DJ sells Coke in the bathroom it was literally like five minutes of just the most offensive [ __ ] oh I looked like a douchebag and I was like damn but I mean I guess that's spirit influencer and a DJ now so I don't know too much about your lifestyle but like yeah this is what ended up happening yeah he nailed it he actually had a similar thing he's like got a call he's like oh yeah I'm gonna be on CSI and they're like CSI it's a terrorist plot he's like oh man come on dude damn it and he actually what he did was he changed his name so his name is not actually Cal pen his name is like kelp and Modi and he's like I'm not getting any auditions for the roles I want so we just created a fake name by splitting his first name yeah and then he started getting calls in and then they're like he shows up he's not white and they were like oh okay Acer here go ahead and read the role and see what happens yeah yeah actually the funny thing is the one of the bigger roles he got was like Indian doctor on house and I was like ah you split the difference but like you know still kind of stereotypical in a way did you when you were like trying to get better at what you were doing um how did you do that because like obviously you get better by just doing reps but sometimes you know if I want to get better or something I might you know hire a coach read a book take a class uh like study and break down people are already good at it like how did you get good at doing what you do was there a any intentional kind of process you went through I think a lot of the times um if I'm thinking about like getting what makes a good podcast or what makes a good YouTube video or what makes a good song I'll just like consume a lot of it and just think about it a lot but I mean like the number one thing you can do is just do it you just learn by doing at least for me um so that's that's how I've Gotten Good is just reps over time because like if you go and listen to my first episode of my podcast it was complete garbage right it's just something I've gotten better at I'm still not that great at it but like I've gotten better at it through the years right um and now I'm going through that sort of with like music production too it's just like I'm at the beginning stage where I'm like everything I make is a little bit better and just leaning into that the joy and like Conquering the zero to one phase and yeah just like learning to enjoy that part of the learning curve I think is really important what are some things you figured out that made like let's say that that cringe series which now has like I don't know 150 million views on that that that style of video that you do what's something you figured out you're like oh that's I used to do it this way then I figured out this and made it better I don't know if it's really anything conscious you know it could it's like it's mostly stuff that you just like innately pick up on when you do things over and over again when you read comments and think about what people are reacting to um but you know a lot of the times it's like the first time we did a video like that you know we were trying to riff and kind of stepping over each other's lines and jokes and punch lines and stuff and the next time we did it we got a little bit better at like letting each other speak and breathe and like that's one thing that I think we're really good at now is we never speak over each other like we never interrupt we're really good at riffing but like because we're innately just conscious of like you know the audience and what they want to hear and no one likes to hear people interrupting and stepping all over each other's jokes you know um so stuff like that um we just get better at like just because you do it you know uh I like that answer even though I wanted you to say like the trick uh it's like a lesson I've had to relearn so many times that they're really like you know there are things that make things better but they're like there wasn't the trick yeah it was like a shitload of reps yeah and caring and then like you know you're just sort of like get better with every rep but there's like there's kind of the boring it's like the it's not the answer that's like yes I found the secret I don't think it would be fun if you went from zero to good at something just by doing one little trick because it doesn't you don't like I find so much joy in in like getting a little bit better at something every time I do it and then seeing a little evidence of that what you get by posting online right like the next time you do something you obviously need you know five comments being like wow this is better than the last one you did and you're like [ __ ] yeah yeah I'm getting it you know that drives me I love that feeling we had uh Mark Manson come in court here uh the day before and he he has this thing he said is like uh happiness uh people think happiness comes from not having problems happiness comes from solving problems yeah totally and I was like oh yeah but it's like so [ __ ] true and um the better version of that it turns out is like when you um when you feel like you chose your that problem so like if the weather's just bad you know yeah you know it's like oh I didn't choose this it's happening to me yeah but if you're like you know I wanna like for you you're like doing these long right 50 mile races 100 mile races or whatever it's like you're choosing a set of problems that you're gonna get you know struggle but get satisfaction with as you overcome them yeah um right now what are those for you so it's like the endurance stuff maybe the business stuff is like that too for you or no uh yes for sure both of both of those things let's let's talk about the business stuff so on the business side uh you know a lot of these creators are building Brands off their style like products yeah I mean for me it was like investing or other stuff are you doing any of that stuff I am yeah I'm developing something that I'm gonna launch in the fall but uh for me it was always kind of difficult I would see people doing it and I was like this okay this seems obvious and then I would think like the money that people are paying us to promote their [ __ ] on the show like expressvpn for example they've been a sponsor of the show for years and they've probably paid us like you know if we totaled it all up it's like an insane amount of money right but their return on investment must have been way higher right otherwise they would then be crazy to re-buy the ads year after year so I'm like why don't we just like it just makes sense for us to own Something That We're promoting because then we see all the upside right um but it it was always it always kind of killed me thinking of the right thing because I don't want to force anything on on my audience uh and comedy is a very hard thing to like align with a product or a service because it's just something that people enjoy it's not you know it's not like I don't know it's not like Fitness or cooking where there's like products that people use every time they cook with comedy it's not like that it's uh it's just like I don't know generic and sort of so I like when I started doing the endurance stuff that's when I was like oh there's a lot of stuff that I'm doing every day yeah that it's natural for me to promote and this is really cool Cody's run Club yeah so this is kind of kind of my first like uh product in this direction where like I wanted to make something more like Fitness focused um so this is like the first time I've done like running shorts for example when you're promoting it are you doing because that little like video that was on there was kind of funny are you like using the like are you leaning into the humor side are you trying to be like more serious when you're promoting the stuff uh that's something I still kind of battle with myself over how serious because like I always want to be but comedy is a very easy crutch to lean on because it's like I like making fun of myself and also if I'm a little bit self-conscious about something it's like oh I was just joking so like this you know it's like a hard for me to sit in a studio and actually make a fitness video because I'm like I'm not that guy right I'm just doing endurance races because I like doing it it's a challenge but I'm not the guy that's out there like in slow-mo like you can do anything right now so I like I like to blend the two I mean that was great like you're just like on the bike and the guy's like spraying it yeah spring the Mist in your face to like look like you're sweating that's great so yeah this is like my first you know time kind of generating a product and like the more Fitness lane and then I'm gonna do something else that I think will hopefully be a little bit bigger it'd be funny if you were just sort of the anti-david Goggins like just went the other way yeah stay soft yes marshmallows just sign off with something so so incredibly soft do you uh you listen to a lot of his stuff uh I do I mean I read his bro his first book and uh I've listened to his like Joe Rogan episodes and stuff like that you should uh have you read the book uh living with a seal no um it's a great book there's an entrepreneur named Jesse itzler do you know him have you ever heard of this guy Jesse it's it'sler no he um so he married the woman who created Spanx okay um he and then he created like Spanx like the concept the action the uh spanking uh yeah that would be big that would be that's a big idea she uh sorry and he created like he started off as a white rapper and then uh he's always like white rapper things like all right not gonna make it as a rapper so he's like I'm gonna work in a um record like a record label so he's like working as a record label his intern was uh like this guy who's trying to be this rappers trying to be all hard he's like yeah I like this guy it was 50 Cent so 50 Cent was his intern for a little bit 50 Cent goes off blows up so he's like okay um he's like that guy like had it I don't really have it but he's like what do I what can I do he's like he started creating Jingles so like rap Jingles okay so he's like um he created the Knicks theme song like the New York Knicks like go Knicks go whatever go New York go and so he created sports like jingle like kind of like quick wraps for companies okay and then he sells that company for like at a 4 million all right I got four million bucks I split it between the two guys what do we gonna do now that we got two million bucks and they after they sold they met a rich guy who took him on a private jet and they were like flying in this private gender like this is amazing we would love to do this more we can't afford a jet so like it'd be cool if you could just own like a couple rides on a jet like a piece of a jet like what if I could just flange that 10 times that'd be amazing yeah timeshare for jets so they created that ended up selling that jet or something they sold it to netjets so uh there was like Marquee I think it was there so and so they sold it to netjets which was owned by Warren Buffett that was a huge sale and then now he like owns a piece of an NBA team he like you know zico coconut water he like invested a bunch in that early on when he was like oh coconut water is going to be a big thing yeah uh because he's an endurance athlete so oh nice I love doing long runs and so he he's like the running Community loves coconut water I think mainstream is gonna too yeah so he found a small brand that wasn't doing that well put a bunch of money in and they ended up like selling it to Coke later I listened to that how I built this episode it's that's like one of my favorites the coconut water one yeah if you're looking for a good one yeah look look up Bad episode and watch that it's great lion info have you heard of HubSpot ERM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better foreign I gotta tell you about one thing that's one of the great joys of my life and I'm not a cars guy I'm not a watch guy but there's one thing that gives me a lot of joy and that is having a virtual assistant uh you know here's the scenario I'm running my companies and even though I'm supposed to be this uh CEO we all know I spend 20 30 of my time just doing random [ __ ] stuff that is not high value but it's just tedious the stuff that has to get done but it's not creativity it doesn't require me and it doesn't add a bunch of value to the business it's just stuff just stuff that has to get done and so that stuff is what a virtual assistant does like just this week alone you know I lose my wallet so she goes to the DMV website fills out a bunch of forms it gets me a new license or um you know every morning people have their morning coffee I have my morning metrics and my morning metrics are basically all the business metrics that I care about compiled she goes she finds it for all the different sources puts it in Excel sheet takes a screenshot text it to me so that when I wake up in the morning I don't go on Twitter or check my email I'm looking at what are what are the metrics at and what do I need to do I'm focused on the right things so having a virtual assistant is a no-brainer whether it's travel booking email inbox or just knocking stuff off your personal to-do list that would have just lingered there forever um I think it's a no-brainer if you're a business owner you should definitely do it um I think one of the best ways to find a assistant is Shepard so go to support shepherd.com you know I pay my assistant I think eight dollars an hour something like that that's double what she was making in her previous job so it's a win for her and for me it's super affordable it's something that you know you don't need to have the biggest business ever be the biggest big shot in order to afford it so it's amazing I now do this for my CEO and my cm02 like I just give them assistance without them even asking because I know it makes them more productive that's it does that for me so of course it's going to do that for them too so go to sportsshopper.com check them out um get an assistant and tell them I sent you they'll take good care of you if you do that so sportsrefer.com check it out and one of the things he did along the way was he was like I don't really want to run this like I guess there's some hardcore race in Arizona or whatever the hardest race Death Valley or something something like that and he goes there and he sees uh people running and then he sees um this guy he's just like a huge guy running this race and he's like by himself um he's like bleeding and he's running and it's David Goggins essentially and he meets him and he's like hey I want to run this race next year um will you train me and he's like will you live in my house and train me uh for like 30 days and then he did and then he wrote a few years later he wrote a book about that whole experience oh that's cool this is before anyone who knew who David Goggins was so the book came out and he just calls it living with a ceiling never mentions the guy's name but he's like this character that's like just like hard as [ __ ] and just like you know would wake him up like you know three in the morning they just like they would run like eight miles at night yeah you'd wake up at three in the morning and be like wake up [ __ ] it's time you know like he'd be like let's go we're going running again again and again I gotta read that it's a great book it's a great read it yeah living with a seal it's a good uh a good one have you like for the running thing is it like why like I don't I'm like if you told me to do an endurance thing I'd be like oh you've suggested my least favorite activity on Earth yeah yeah why do you do it my parents did it growing up so it it's kind of in my blood I saw them do it um and I've always like they they raised us like we would go on bike trips all the time and so we were always doing it and then we would see them do these incredible Feats of fitness and it just became something that I that drove me and then I was like an athlete in college and stuff so when I graduated I was like I need something to stay in shape so like running just seemed like the most natural thing and then uh once you do you know five miles you're like oh or once you do three miles you're like I think I can do five and then you're like ah I should I should maybe go for a half marathon you get kind of addicted to it right and then so I've done like marathons ever since and then my sister signed up for an Iron Man and she did it and she's my younger sister so I was like damn it she did that before me so then I signed up for one and then I did one and now it just kind of like through that I was going through like a pretty dark period like right after covid and uh through training for this for these I did an ultra marathon first and then I did an Iron Man and through training for those I kind of like refound my confidence and my happiness so now it's like something I want to make part of my life so like I started the training Channel um and now I'm just planning more things like I'm gonna do the New York Marathon and then I'm planning 100 and something mile altar that I'm trying to do what about the music videos you guys do because um they're amazing and uh they're like almost like too amazing it's like like where did this come from why is this like why is this good are you guys is this what you guys actually do like I didn't really understand the first time I saw one I was like this is uh I don't know I was just like very jealous I was like holy [ __ ] like you can't have you can't be like Oh I'm relatable and funny but I'm also like Mega talented on the other side it's like no no you get to pick you know that's how life Works um how did you guys start doing that and why is it like why is it so so [ __ ] good and like why did you lean it up more if it's so good I do think that yeah like a lot of the stuff I've done or been successful at it's been like like I'm the person to look at a pipe dream and be like it would be really cool to be that and then like actually try and so that's kind of how that started was like you don't count yourself out you mean like yeah exactly like I I somewhere in me kind of believe that I'm probably capable of that somewhere and I think everyone is of everything um but I'm pretty good at like not you know turning myself down I guess at the beginning and that's kind of what I lost in that like dark period was I lost that confidence and if I thought of something I would revert back to like no you couldn't accomplish that um but when it came to music I was always like it'd be cool to like do it would be cool to like go online and say I have a new song out you know what I mean that would be a really cool backwards from that yeah exactly and like I never I never played any instruments besides drums growing up I was never really musically inclined I had a good sense of Rhythm and I really enjoyed music and so I was kind of like now this is something that's not really for you and then I was like no why can't it be and so I downloaded FL Studio I made a beat and for one of our videos I invited Noelle over because he used to actually rap in high school so I was like I made this beat can you just wrap over it and we'll make a funny song for the end of this video and uh he you know took a little bit of convincing because he was like I closed this chapter of my life so finally got I got him over to the place he you know put a verse down I recorded my verse I wrote and recorded and then I was like tried to figure out how to process a voice which song about this horrible song called keep your dick fat and then which is a comedy song again again the comedy is a nice crutch to lean on where you're like we're bad but it's funny yeah exactly so people don't like put too much pressure on you or make fun of you too much and so we did that oh that's still up wow okay this is my first beat ever it's horrible yeah I like the beginning stuff I always like the early stuff foreign how'd you decide on that as the concept like what what didn't make it that this one as the idea that's a great question actually I totally forget how we even came up with that I think he must have said keep your dick fat or something and then I was like oh that's funny let's put that down well that's also how tiny beat gang came out right like that that's it was just yeah like just like that was our whole thing it's just dick jokes and being stupid and being five years old so and then so after we released this uh we shot a music video for it and uh where we like used a friend that was a DP and we shot it all nice and then we're like oh this is a fun thing like doing something a little bit more high production value this is like a really fun path to go down and then shortly after this I got a DM from a producer in La his name's Diamond pistols now like a fantastic friend and has produced a ton of music for us um he was like Hey I'm a producer let me produce your next song this is really funny and so we were like sure and we showed up at his place and we made a song called super Zan like in a day or like we did we made that song in a day and how do you make a song so you get there I mean if you're working with a good producer it's you get there they're like what do you want to make and you're like okay well I've been listening usually the way a music session starts is you'll just listen to music together and you'll be like I've really been into this song recently you'll put it on try to find some sort of inspiration or if you come in with a concept then you'll kind of work off that we didn't really have anything and so he started making a beat we just like wrote some [ __ ] lyrics and then we came up with this concert like at that time Xanax was like the big thing like Lil pump and all these guys were talking about doing Xanax all the time so we were like let's make a song called super Zan where it doesn't make any sense because we don't actually know what like mainstream rap lyrics mean we're just kind of trying to you know hang on to the trending references and stuff like that so then once we made that song we're like it's the song is pretty damn good let's shoot another video for it and Noel called in a bunch of favors we ended up getting a horse for the video these look expensive too so you guys like yeah this one was probably like you made a bet you're like it's worth it yes yeah I mean music videos are a money pits at the time was that like kind of like significant like is that like this was like a lot of money oh yeah it was we had nothing back then so it was huge so like I said a lot of people did it like on favors because they liked us and that's Diamond Epistles you know a lot of people that were in the video like she was a paid actress but um are just like friends and stuff and we knew someone who had a horse and they brought the horse and we paid them like 500 bucks or something wow uh so then we released this on Spotify and it actually got a lot of streams because people watched the video because it was funny so then we were like we should do an EP Maybe so then we started making more music and then fast forward two two EPs and albums later we signed a music deal with Arista and we released two songs with them one of them being broke [ __ ] was now has like over 50 million streams I think Walkman has like 80 million or 90 million yeah I think I saw one was like 85 plus it's almost gold was that is that 100 100 million gold uh it's just like it's a hundred thousand or it's 10 a million sales it's a weird equation but I think it's almost certified gold which is [ __ ] crazy that's a funny uh rap idea for you like because everyone's always a platinum yeah yeah it's like we went gold yeah exactly so you um that's good I like that yeah I might steal that yeah I'm funny too okay one of my questions on my list was like how do I am I was am I funny and how do I get funnier so I would say because you listen to the Pod go ahead yeah I would say you're definitely funny I chuckle I think you guys here I'll give you some constructive criticism from a listener from a fan of the show I think you need better cold opens agreed a lot of times I feel like you used the wrong moments well you should use the funnier moments maybe it's even dumber than that we come from a different world so it's like uh we're just dumb about like how you would do a creative process it's like oh you should care about this and like you should run a process that like like looks at the feedback or the data and then like makes it better yeah or like watch it together and be like what could we do better yeah we've never done that yeah but we should I mean I don't know the show's good so that's like that's my only little thing because it's such a it's such a great opportunity for a laugh right before the smash cut to the intro it's such a beautiful thing and so we we tend to like take our cold opens pretty seriously or like we need we need a good laugh right at the beginning of the show so when someone turns it on they're like huh I knew I liked this show another week you know I'm sticking around one more weeks yeah exactly I'll Stick Around for 10 minutes exactly section for you where I was going to pitch you a slash oh yeah okay we had one before you walked in it was in s'mores yeah I was like why isn't there something called Frozen s'mores so why me though well we have the idea of right before you arrived and I was like I gotta ask Cody about Frozen s'mores potential you think there's potential there listen I like so what we're gonna do here let me tell you how this side how this came about okay I was like in the studio or whatever I was like I want uh because this this might look however it looks but like we're in an office building and this is like a small like cubicle of office uh when we're here I was like I want to buy an ice cream truck and turn it into a podcast studio and like roll it up to wherever we're gonna whoever I wanna record with and like yeah that's what Evo does he does it in an ice cream truck it's not in an ice cream truck but he has like a sprinter van right that he's turned into a little bit I was worried that much people having a traveling set because he pulled up right outside my house and I literally like my commute was two seconds so that's what I want to do yeah it was pretty sick and uh so we're like okay let's retrofit it and then Ben was like you know well we gotta just create an ice cream brand if we're gonna do that and then yeah Frozen s'mores yeah okay okay it's a s'more I see the cold and the marshmallows vanilla ice cream okay that's idea number one I have for you that's good I like that yeah marshmallows are my least favorite thing about s'mores agreed agreed um okay next one uh let's make a Netflix show so I wanted to brainstorm with you real quick okay a Netflix show business related so business unscripted that's the category okay so shark tank is a great show yeah we need more uh so like you know the way like you know American Idol happened and then the people were like oh [ __ ] The Voice X Factor America's Got Talent like people just took that format and started remixing masks singer like they they're like people like this amateur singing thing we're gonna do it yeah I think people like the amateur business thing yeah shark tank works yep there's not really another shark tank uh there's not like another remixed version of a cool thing that you would want if you like shark think you might like this so we could do one for like creators so I don't know just like what what would work what do you think I like the idea of doing it where people like come in and Pitch their Channel or they're like Tick Tock idea or whatever this was uh Sully's idea last night he's like yeah we need it for creators yeah that's good I think I've heard someone doing that I think because I've that's not the first time I've heard that idea right but I think it's an awesome idea so like how would it work so they come in you got you as a guest as like a successful creators maybe are the like judges or whatever what do they get because like you know in a business thing you're like I get what does the contestant get like what do they want to create the to create their channel so every Creator just needs money to fund their idea I see yeah and then you'd maybe like as a judge you'd be like hey now I get like 10 of I'm your manager now I get 10 of everything that you make right in the future yeah okay you're in I I was like it sounds like you're in it's not I'm in on both so far Okay cool so we're doing all of these yeah we're Frozen s'mores first clearly yeah second uh shark tank for for creators yep um another one uh app startup ideas okay so cap that yep smash it yeah cap that plus true smash I kept that too I kept that two plus was it two plus where it ended this that's when traction started dying a little bit have you had any and you were almost I say almost because I think your friend best friend something like that started Cameo so you were like very close also to creating Cameo yeah or being a part of Cameo oh yeah I could have been in at the beginning they were making that in my living room and I was like this is you're like okay guys cool yeah it looks cool what these guys doing then I go record a YouTube video like that's any cooler and uh and then it blew the [ __ ] up and then I ended up investing in series a right and I was like these guys were building this beside me well good for you because I anytime I missed the first round it kills me to come in later even though like you should just come in it's like yeah and I'm like so anchored yeah and you're like the fact that they were in my living it's out of the principle yeah yeah I will lose more yeah exactly so uh have you had any other like you know viral app ideas that you haven't pursued because you're busy being like I had one famous one it was like it was like um it was like an app where you could figure out where to buy Frozen s'mores Frozen small locator yes exactly but then I was like wait that doesn't exist yet so someone has to invent that and then I'm gonna make that app yeah do you have any problems or pain points or opportunities you've seen as like you know your creator there's tons of companies that Silicon Valley like we serve the Creator economy yeah but I don't think they really know or understand really how creators lifestyle is what they actually want have you seen any um like pain points or opportunities that you think somebody who's business-minded would go do I think AI like has kind of revolutionized I mean like it has everything but I think it's there's a lot of potential there to help creators whether it's with like thumbnails something as simple as a thumbnail or a title right like I've noticed people using AI to make their thumbnails stand out in crazy ass ways what do they even use for that like what are they I don't know but a lot of times like they'll just make it look a little bit cartoony but they'll they'll like blend it with the original thumbnail so that it's not gotcha obvious but it's eye-catching you're like something's weird about that thumbnail which is what it takes it doesn't it like you know people think that a good thumbnail is like contrast and colors and it's like a lot of times that ends up blending in right you just want to look different so I think AI does that I remember in history class at Duke actually I learned uh that Hitler did that so back in the day you and Hitler okay yeah wow like mine's thinking like he all the posters were colored like just like print there everybody was and so he all of his marketing was done in black and white black and white Flyers posters whatever yeah because it was just the contrast to everything else and it was like yeah so there you go take a page out of Hitler's book what do you think about thumbnails exactly um but yeah I think there's other stuff like for example both podcasting I know there's so much with ads that you can do the most obvious to me being like just you know training some you know AI on how we speak just feeding at the transcript of our 500 episodes right and then having it write the ads for us in our own voice and then actually synthesizing our voices and reading the ads for us so we don't actually have to record anything right and then eventually just doing the whole podcast but like the ad thing I think is so obvious it should happen right away and if it's not already being worked on have you uh had anybody like send you a link to like here's you doing a podcast or is he doing an ad yeah it's kind of I mean we did it last time it was like uh I forget the company's name but I think they were looking for investment and then I think I didn't reply to the first email so the second one they're like here here's you by the way here's your voice and it was an app where you could call you Elon for example and have a conversation with Elon right on you know your computer speaker basically and so we called me on the podcast and both of us just talked with me and it was so [ __ ] scary wow and weird you're like he's this guy's great yeah yeah exactly that's funny I was like our job is over right we're not gonna have this job in a year you met Elon right you yeah was it you went to uh you went to his house I party with him one time how was it tell me everything how does that even happen we were uh this is the first time I ever met post Malone and we're like you know good friends now I wouldn't I don't say that as a flex I'm just like I [ __ ] love the guy and whenever he hits me up I'm down to hang out uh but the first time he DMS me which is often it's not often he's a [ __ ] rock star so it's like I don't hear from him for eight months and then all of a sudden he'll text me and he's like I'm in town with them we're like I'm like [ __ ] yeah let's hang um but he hit us up on or he hit me up on Twitter and and all I think and was like hey dad or something like that like I love your videos or something and I was like oh my God I was a huge fan of his music so I was like it's like so thrilled and then he was like I'm gonna I'm flying back from Australia in three days or something like that like let's get drinks and I was like let's do it and I think I was at I was with Kelsey's family at the time my wife like at a family dinner or something and he was like I'm back in town let's meet at the Rainbow Room in you know an hour and I was like all right guys I gotta go sorry Kelsey's family asked gotta dip out um so we went met up with him at the rainbow room and we got [ __ ] up we were drinking you know lemon drops and and it was just like this surreal experience where we're just like because he's very simple he's the same sense of humor so we're just like joking around riffing having a great time and then he looks at his phone he's like Elon elon's been texting me and we're like uh yeah sure yeah totally just thinking it was a joke and then he showed us his phone it was like Elon Musk it was like come over and we were like and he was like he was like should we go over to his house and we were like uh yeah I mean you can't really say no to that yeah and so he got in cars and drove to his house and uh we got to his house and him and Grimes are like standing on the driveway with lanterns like welcome to what is that like I don't know it was [ __ ] it was so the whole thing was from a dream I swear to God it was the weirdest night of all time was it like a thousand people there or it's like just y'all no it was like 10 or not even it was like post crew plus us these like you know Hangers On they're just like I include me and [ __ ] and then it was Elon and Grimes and like uh I forget who else was there a couple like producers and like two other people so we're all sitting around the fire and it's like two or three in the morning and we're just sitting there talking and posting Elon or talking and he's like nursing a glass of whiskey or something like that and I remember thinking like this house doesn't have any furniture is really weird and someone was like well this is his like Party House his like family houses across the street or something and I was like oh that makes sense he's like a billionaired yes yeah exactly I would have a party house if I could have one um with no furniture yeah and So eventually and then and they're all standing what so you're all standing no no we're sitting outside of outside like around a fire pit like on some ledge or something like that I think there were like a couple chairs they were very sporadic um and then I remember like we we finally it was like 4 a.m I was like okay I gotta go home Kelsey's asking where I'm at and so we go downstairs can't figure out which door leads out and I was like I don't want to open a random door and then there's like a spaceship in there and they're like yeah quick there's not enough time get on so then I go back upstairs and I like lean around the corner and Elon and Grimes are making out and I was like okay I'm not gonna interrupt that so then we just went downstairs found the door and then we're sitting both of us you know all are sitting on the curb afterwards looking up just like what the [ __ ] No One's Gonna believe this like this is the wildest night we've ever had it was crazy that's insane what's he like he was nice yeah he was nice I was pretty drunk what is one talking my memory is a little foggy but I remember him saying some things that were like okay he clearly like thinks a little bit differently about things what did you uh are you like like what's your in that moment because whenever I meet celebrities I make a complete ass out of myself um to the point where I'm like I don't want to go and I don't want to meet him I don't want to do it it's you know I start thinking stupid things and I say stupid things I think I like it was one of those things where we were not invited it was like posts that was invited so he really wanted to get to know post so they were talking and we were sitting beside just kind of going yeah so yeah well I mean yeah totally I think that's agree agreeing so we were trying to like you know not be a nuisance right that's a better mentality that's yeah that's my new mentality with celebrities just be there not be a nuisance and don't yeah don't get people to wish you weren't there you know that's the new win yeah exactly yeah because my win is like we're best friends after this so what I need to do is off this guy no yeah I was too scared honestly that's hilarious dude this was fun thanks for coming on yeah this was great uh thanks for doing thanks for having me appreciate it oh bye that's a wraps [Music] foreign

[Music] [Applause] all right I'm scrolling on Twitter and I just keep seeing this the most uncomfortable live interview I've ever watched the cringiest interview the worst CEO interview I've ever seen and you know what I got to do you know what we got to do when it's cringe City cuz I'm the mayor of cringe City we got to watch this interview that everybody is talking about it's the the new CEO of Twitter so Elon hire this woman Linda yako she gave an interview and I'm excited because uh he I love CEO cringe I love CEO cringe some guys like toes some people like furries some people like the Japanese animes [ __ ] they're into that everybody's got a thing this is my thing CEO cringe I Can't Get Enough let's jump [Applause] in where am I going I think they're here yeah for our microphones yeah maybe go to the empty chair um Linda thank you for being here I want to make sure to get uh to give you an opportunity to respond to yel Roth and his comments about an hour ago okay so what happened was at this conference the code conference and they've always had a bunch of CEOs come to this like Steve Jobs Elon Musk uh Travis colanic from Uber they've had they always have these Headliners and this year the headliner was going to be Linda yako so what I guess what happened is before she this is she's the headliner before she went on this guy yoel Roth who used to work at Twitter uh was a surprise guest so that's why this is a little bit controversial he was a surprise guest somebody the CEO of GM dropped out they were like oh we have a last minute replacement this guy yoel he comes on and he basically he used to be the head of trust and safety at Twitter when Elon first bought it he was like go follow yel that's the place to get upto-date info on trust and safety he's the man and then in five weeks he got fired you know quit got fired whatever um and him and Elon got a big spat about it so they're not on good terms so I guess this guy yoel came on right before this and the context is he was obviously sharing his negativity about Twitter so she kind of like got like blindsided I guess before this so that's the context um Chuckles I'd be happy to respond um I think I've been given about 45 minutes but I do want to address um yoel and I don't know each other he doesn't know me I don't know him why is she using like a uh Asm R voice like CEO ASMR she's like it's like bedtime story as she's like and Hensel and gredle went all the way through the forest is this a funeral why is she coming out with this energy I've never seen her talk before so this is uh this is not what I imagine the CEO of Twitter or X or whatever to sound like okay more ASMR I work at X he worked at Twitter X is a new company building a foundation based on free expression and freedom of speech Twitter at the top ironic by the way she's like really upset that he just came on this he went on stage at this conference and like spoke his mind um while being like X is the Free Speech platform shouldn't she just be fine with him speaking his mind no time was operating on a different sets of rules as said by himself uh different uh philosophies and ideologies that were creeping down the road of censorship it's a new day at X and I'll leave it at that who else is inspired by that it's a new day x and it is what it is like she's trying to say something optimistic but the way she's saying it is this how she always talks the way she's saying it is so uh downtrodden I don't understand if you go on stage everything is wonderful we're going amazing nobody believes you uh so that a very strange seriously the uh team at Twitter is fantastic oh oh right after giving the big speech that he worked at Twitter I work at X comes back and says the team at Twitter is doing fantastic she's just like all of us we call it Facebook not better we call it Twitter not X you can't make fetch a thing if you're talking about my own personal well-being and safety uh I feel great um I'm well protected what I he made a comment about the Ft interview uh I guess as he was preparing to come on the stage uh that the public scrutiny weighs heavy on me uh my kids my family my parents uh I think that's just a a human emotion when you get thrust into such a public Spotlight uh in conjunction with the nature of the platform itself is she is she trying to hit a word count this is this is me in ninth grade just double spaced trying to hit the word count to get to get this in I mean that's just human nature in conjunction therefore such as she sounds like the girl from the the Miss USA pageant okay people out there in our nation don't have maps and I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and the Iraq everywhere like such as and S when you're automatically a recognizable public feature uh public person 247 globally and and with the ability for uh or the inability for anyone to control other humans uh actions comments recognizable and I'm an identical twin recognizable what actions comments recognizable what what is she talking about think how she feels all right solid actually made the security team a a Dollar Bet cuz I only ever bet a Dollar by the way because the reason I only bet a dollar let me finish that for you cuz I'm already rich the reason I only bet a dollar is because I'm already super rich and it would make absolutely no difference to me if I won or didn't win you know give it give me the Jeff Bezos uh laugh it's because I'm super rich ever is because it's really only about winning but I want to uh it's very hard for me to refute or sift through the combination of opinions of yoel's experience and the positioned as fact uh that were pres she's made two mistakes so far first ASMR funeral voice telling the Hansel gr of bedtime story very strange choice right you come out and people feel you're making people feel a certain way because the way it looks like you feel and so her entire energy was was wrong she did not come correct somebody who is confident somebody who is optimistic about what's going on somebody who's excited to be here um they will they would have a totally different energy so so that was the first mistake she made was she let this guy's previous talk throw her completely off her game and come out with this very strange energy second thing where now 6 minutes and 30 seconds into this this interview she still address all the points that he made nobody would have even paid attention to that guy's talk she's six and a half minutes in and is still playing defense if you're explaining you're losing right it's as simple as that like number one PR rule if you're explaining you're losing and she is explaining but but Linda because I I want to shift gears from yoel's interview to a conversation about the business nice doing her a solid being like hey BBE stop talking about y and start talking about your business y had 25 minutes to talk about it you have a lot longer yel got the blue one and I want the blue one but he has the blue one but then if I get the blue one then I'm going to have it if if you you want you have all the time that you have for us um I want to talk to you about the business and that and the issues of Engagement because I see a lot of data as a reporter at znbc and apptopia which tracks app usage says the actual time spent on Twitter did get a post Elon bump after that acquisition but has tracked down all year since then a new report out from apptopia just this month says app downloads have sunk to new loads it's in 96th place and when it comes to usage X is now 25th in active users behind Telegram and even Samsung clock so how can we reconcile what musk has said about engagement the numbers you just cited with all of these different data points here well uh you know with over 54 40 million Global users the I I'd love to sift through um you know the data points that that you picked out uh uh and they're really just tracks tracks of app downloads and engagement yeah yeah uh but when you look at the length of time spent yeah but you know it doesn't yeah but I don't want to talk about that so yeah but let's look at something else the engagement on X right now the key metrics are trending very very positive ly so if we want to talk about all the initiatives that have been put in place like was covered in the previous interview about all the uh brand safety and content moderation tools that exist now within my first 100 days at the company that didn't exist for the eight years prior uh uh formerly known as Twitter I think those are the type of things we could be F we should be focusing on on in terms of progress that has been made because in the just short 100 days is that I've been at the company what had to happen was was for me to you know kind of get in look on near the hood why is she acting like a raccoon get in there sip through the trash I've seen that I have seen that in my backyard before that is a Rec go through trash and when I realized and I looked at because it's still a lot of learning what what did you realize Linda what did you realize say it just say a simple sentence I mean come on it's it's 100 days there's a lot of learning that's still going to go on what are the learning tell me the velocity of change no we're not talking scope of the ambition is m x really say what you Lear does not exist when you raccooned through the data what did you find Linda anywhere else forget the other platforms at any other company likely on Earth there is no analog for the book that is being written right now book you what are you talking about also Ultra dismissive hand motion shut your mouth hand motion nice Advertiser products that did not exist that are now wrapped up in brand safety thirdparty verif ification the company that was described about an hour ago no longer exists and I would argue pretty aggressively no matter if you want to I I I don't know the the the stat did you say telegram yeah five minutes ago when I asked you why you're ranking below Telegram and downloads and then you started talking about scope and velocity I did say telegram does anyone say telegram no you're behind Telegram no no I know I I I it I have to I have to scrub up your numbers um does anyone even talk about telegram anymore yeah no I'm saying you guys were behind them less downloads than them you're worse than the people you're making fun of yeah I got to scrub your numbers okay let's scrub it up dub App Store charts free free apps let's go where you at Telegram telegram number 22 x x number 63 we scrubed the numbers Linda you're behind Southwest Air you're behind peacock and impulse brain training oh greatest app of all time here right coming in at number 68 let's go we scrubbed the numbers we scrubbed them they're good they're clean um but that being said that when you put in context what has happened in the last 10 months and specifically the last 12 weeks of listening to our employees listening listening to your employees you fired all your employees you fired 80% of your employees what are you talking about you can't hear them they're W they're walking away with their box from their desk what are you going to hear the great news is another fact that was um inaccurate uh uh in June actually did an interview with one of your colleagues at CNBC Sarah Eisen specific time and I think August was that August 100 days oh yeah I started in June it's all a blur um uh because again the pace of innovation is unlike anything oh what a gem of an excuse the next time I'm like oh I'm late to pick up my daughter from school it's the pace of innovation so why I'm late you could ever imagine uh think about it it's exhilarating to the point of intoxicating that's why she's got bars though I'll give her that she's like Mike Tyson there's no one that can match me my style is impetuous my defense is impregnable and I'm just ferocious I want your heart I want to eat his children praise be to Allah and you get inspired and pushed by Elon Musk to do the things that you would never normally think were possible you land on a day like today you show up you tell them the mountain high of accomplishments that were made in just 12 weeks she's going Michelle Obama when they go low we go high and you don't look back and compare yourself to a legacy company that doesn't exist all you're doing is comparing yourself what are you talking about Linda I want to get some of these stats so you mentioned your it's been a day so I brought my car you're welcome to I have my I was supposed to was that blank just now hold on got to go back I want to get some of these stats so you mentioned your it's been a day so I brought you're welcome to I have I was supposed to I think that might be a blank sheet of paper put an x on it but I was watching the interview and I didn't have time okay so one question I have is what are the daily active users that you have because that is the metric that t was using came over and you mentioned the Sarah Eisen interview what are your daily active users and then also you told Sarah you were nearing profitability how close are you yeah well that's so exciting I'll get i'll get back to your first question but what's so bet she doesn't bet she does not get back to that first question hey I'll bet you a dollar Linda you only bet a dollar I bet you a dollar you don't answer the daily activ question but let's see exciting is that um from an operating cash flow perspective we're just about Break Even so the um uh a kind of other emotion that was painted in the previous talk feel pretty good about where we are and when I did the other talk that you said was in August um it was too soon I think it was about five or six week in I couldn't have eyes on uh even the rest of third quarter let alone fourth quarter so um now that I have uh uh immers myself in the business and we H have a good set of eyes on what is predictable and what's coming is that it looks like in early 24 we be turning a profit so that's exciting so so 90% of the top 100 advertisers have returned to the platform in the last 12 weeks alone about 1,500 have returned so whether it is uh uh uh small business or BR big Brands right like AT&T Visa Nissan all returning why are they returning they are returning because of the power and significance of the platform the place that X has in this world why so do you have a stat on daily active yeah I'm going to I love the interviewer smile they're like uh you've been bullshitting for five minutes now now do were you going to tell me the number or no oh now she picked up her phone what happened to her blank sheet of paper probably it it it 200 250 something like that so the stat 200 or 250 million daily active users that's less than when Elon bought it I'm pretty sure leave his facts no this was when musk took over there were 237 million monetizable daily so so listen to this one of the reasons that um um I'm in the chair I'm in today and in the chair I am at X and I do not like green eggs and ham I do not like them Sam I Am So condescending by the way this whole like one of the reasons I'm in this chair and you're down there like that's basically the vibe the energy that she gives off um she asked you simple question how many daily activities you got don't give us this speech about why I'm in the chair I'm in is because I'm so great that's not an answer to how many daily activ users you have leading the company is because I knew for the last decade and you knew this part of my old remit was to oversee not only the advertising revenue for the company but to look after all of our Enterprise relationships our I still say our um the all of the nbcu Enterprise relationships and Twitter was one of them I specifically used Ed the name Twitter by the way purposefully and and uh that's when for 10 years and how I fell in love with the platform because I knew first of all we all knew the trajectory of where broadcast cable uh television and usage and consumption was growing yeah the previous company I was at was going down down down down down and so now I'm just the reason I'm in the chairman is because I oversee this what is she talking about but this oh hang on she doesn't have X installed on the home screen of her phone I see Facebook I see Instagram I do not see X it's a black icon where is it I don't see it wow and also what kind of psychopath it looks like she has a settings wheel on her dock what kind of psychopath does that to show your phone talking about how great X is and then not have the app installed this is why ah this is why this is why I do what I do this is why I do what I do aggressive clap this is why I do what I do this is why as the mayor of cringe City we live for this moment where she thinks she's mic dropping she thinks she's saying this really impressive important thing and she's just embarrassing herself that's news when you when I used to sit in my office and watch you on television it was the only what do some work why were you at the office watching television well I'd love to love to I'll give you I'll give you almost like a more personal specific uh number which demon all right another dollar bet I'm up $1 is this going to be personal or specific I bet it's neither rates part of the growth at X if you take our communities 50,000 curated why we talking about 50,000 communities I thought it's going to be personal and specific Linda environments and conversations of communities on X okay the the pause to just absolutely make up whatever that wherever the hell she's going just be like okay so i s 50,000 communities what the hell could I say next numbers and time spent is up dramatically just since June okay right so where was the personal and specific example Linda so hold on I want to Linda we're running short on time so I got to get we have so much to cover here so where do you where do you want to go okay I want to talk about your role running the company and Elon Musk just announced a new monthly fee for users yep and my question for you is do you want to start charging all users of X as he said and how many users do you think you will lose as a result can you repeat can you repeat you repeat this reporter just broke news to the CEO I'm pretty sure that that could you repeat was a what the hell are you talking about let me buy some timeon musk announced you're moving to an entirely subscription based service Nothing free on about using X do you did he say we were moving to it specifically or is thinking about it he said that's the plan yeah so did he yeah news to me consult you before he announced that we talk about everything okay defensive so defensive gotta go back hold on did he say we were moving to it specifically or is thinking about it oh the sit back like she just served her like this is uh whatever Stomp the Yard and she's just her and then he said that's the plan yeah so did he consult you before he announced that cuz you're the CEO right we talk about everything no eye contact look to the crowd we talk about everything did you guys hear that everything is okay I'm in charge here okay you don't cover product the all of the product teams report to Elon Musk and as a result of that there's been a lot of anyone in this room can I can I finish please wait L let me finish please let me finish as a result of the fact that the product team does not report to you the product team at meta reports to Mark Zuckerberg because the product team does not report you there has been speculation that you are in more of a COO role or a sibo role a CEO in name only role you know what's funny is that we talk about that a lot at x uh as you you do everybody asks you are you really the CEO you guys talk about that a lot know it's a very flat organization and the teams are very empowered to perform at their highest levels and who's kidding who I don't care what the structure is at meta but who wouldn't want Elon Musk sitting by their side running Pro I see a show of hands I there may be a few show of hands to get the cute Chuckles you're getting honestly that's a good point uh Elon R Elon is a um a very very very accomplished engineer and uh person capable building things so I think it's totally right you'd rather have him running a product engineering organization not definitely not this lady definitely not the ASMR CEO I mean can you imagine her trying to talk to an engineer like this lady's asking for her number and of like hey how many users do we have and she's talking in circles about velocity of change and Innovation and blah blah blah and saying I'm going to I'll come back to that like Engineers don't like that [ __ ] uh you know you can't just talk circles around people who actually build things you um you have to directly answer their questions or directly give clear concise statements this lady is I mean the BS detector is like I mean if if if the uh car industry wasn't questioned would we have the electronic car industry I mean uh pretty sure she just said electronic cars industry is that what you think Tesla does it makes small electronic cars instead of electric cars you'll be hearing some of those announcements in the next week week or two but thank you so much everyone I got to go I really appreciate Ito thank you for making the time for us today let's see how they ex oh the snub no handshake no hug of no uh words I really appro thank you for making the time for us today stand up thank you and walks by pretends like you don't exist nice power move okay um yeah I grade this and F that is an F defensive insecure says nothing of substance uh this is crazy to me that this is the CEO of Twitter as it will be called um not inspiring I don't understand why somebody would like this is like I think when people think about Corporate America or bureaucratic companies like this to me is the nightmare somebody like this rises in the ranks and becomes CEO of one of the best tech company you know one of the best technology products in the world uh that's used by you know whatever hundreds of millions of people doesn't know the first thing about technology or product or speaking straight English um is just a handwavy type of person that's really crazy to me I got to see more okay this is what is this I Googled her name and this was the first picture that came up you know maybe don't pose maybe don't pose like Jesus on the cross for your uh for your front page photo maybe don't wear all red and dress like and pose like Jesus on the cross uh does she always talk like this I want to see some of her old interviews okay let's see what is this Stephanie rule I accept your coid 19 challenge I'm still stuck mostly at home and I'm doing okay she lost her mind in that video um why is she accepting the co 19 [Music] challenge dancing and washing your hands nothing more performative people uploading videos of themselves precautions this this is how we should end the video just I just want this uninterrupted for 25 seconds producer 25 seconds un interrupted of this wow unbelievable unbelievable okay yeah I gray um I gray that interview and f um just comes across like a total bullshitter um doesn't answer any questions directly super defensive weird ASMR voice and by the way her background it's not like okay when Zuck does weird interviews and it's like oh he looks like a robot this guy's terrible okay genius kid programmer turns out to not be so media Savvy this lady's a media exec she's 60 years old spent her whole career 40 years working in the television industry how is she so poor at doing interviews or media that was that's supposed to be what you're good at if this is how you're like is this what you're good at because you're terrible um all right well that is the end of Sean reacts cring City hope you like this video if you like these I'll do more of them there's plenty of cringe out there there's cringe everywhere to be honest with you if you like these and you want me to do more leave a comment on YouTube saying cring City our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot

my wife is like insane about this stuff she has a drawer full of coupons so we went to Costco this weekend because we had a $20 off or something like that coupon so we still use coupons or [Music] [Music] coupons all right what's going on this is Sam Sean's out with some surgery I've been telling people he's getting a nose job I don't know if that's true but let's just pretend it is but anyway we are doing a quick 10 or 15 minute Q&A session I asked some of the listeners and some of my Twitter fans what type of questions they had for for me and we'll talk about it let's get into it so all right what's the uh first question what do we got let's start with one that's really timely you're about to be a dad someone's asking what is top of Mind as you become a dad so I'm gonna have a child November 1 that's the due date we'll see a little girl what um so in preparation of having this baby I was like freaking out about like just the actual uh like the physical her physical wellbeing of raising her and so I read the biography of Louis and Clark because I remember that sacka joa had a kid like on that Journey or something like that and so I wanted to read the book and so it turns out she had a three-month-old that she carried like in a little sack across America for two years and like you know in the winter and um that kind of like encouraged me like I'm not going to hurt this baby so I'm not too worried about that I would say the biggest thing though that I am freaked out about is raising a spoiled kid and raising a kid that's going to be a drug addict um I'm very like like that like I I genuinely have like a deep fear in me and so I've been trying to figure out how do I like in a very healthy way withhold things from her like how do I not give her what she wants just in order to instill some types of grit because the sounds kind of douchy but I can give her anything she wants like in terms of like physical stuff and I'm really freaking out about how do I stay strong and not give her what she wants in order to create grit and how do I make sure that she's not spoiled and works hard but my biggest fear is Raising like a kid who is freaking out over that or or or who like just feels like she doesn't need to work and so my current thinking this has not been settled but my thinking this is just me not my family me is the only thing that I'll pay for is free tuition and free medical for life and beyond that give her nothing um that's kind of like my current thinking um that's what I had growing up my parents paid for my school and I never had to worry about getting braces or anything like that and that's kind of like where I am now I read the Titan by John Rockefeller and he was the richest person in the world and his wife has this famous quote where she says something like the biggest joy that I have in life right now is withholding from my children things that they want because I know it's going to make them stronger and I'm kind of in that camp at the moment on how to do that but I um I don't feel very confident on the right way that I'm going to do that but my fear is the outcome of a drug addicted indulgent child who won't work hard that that's my biggest fear at the moment and so I'm preparing by like getting my mind right on how to like withhold things from her and not give in because I do give in to a lot of things is that a good answer you have kids am I am I I'm I'm a very withholding weather so I totally get and speaking of you being effing Rich this is a next question that I personally am curious about it's what's the biggest difference in your lifestyle now that you're effing rich I have nothing to do with picking these questions I just want to say that I hate talking I don't like that topic but I will discuss it so basically before I sold my first company I I my four years of salary leading up to it was 20,000 a year 20,000 a year I think I paid myself 150,000 a year and then the last year I think I paid myself $350,000 a year so for the first while I didn't have a lot of money I was I was I I didn't have much and then all of a sudden I sold the business and I I had enough uh at first I did something that I advise everyone not to do which is I bought a few things I bought some real estate I think that I bought a fancy car I think that that brings close to no happiness um and might be one of those things that you have to go through in order to um to truly appreciate but I think that if you do have a windfall you likely shouldn't buy anything crazy fancy for the first year or two and just get used to it but I've also learned there's this like um story about a um this study about these people who studied uh amputees and they found that after 6 months the level of Happiness went back to where they were when they had both legs so you you get hurt you lose your leg you're bummed for a little while after six months you go right back to feeling as good as you did with two legs that kind of happens um when I think when you make some money um but the biggest thing that it did was not what it could purchase you but the biggest change is my confidence my confidence went through the roof I'm incredibly confident in my ability to start something and to see it through to be a success I don't think that I have the confidence where I think everything I'm going to do is is going to be a success I think I still have paranoia that I'm going to lose everything and I still have massive fears about going broke um that is something that my therapist and I are working through still um but it hasn't changed significantly I think that someone had asked a question about monthly expenses before I sold I think I was spending anywhere between1 and $15,000 a month my apartment at the time was $4,000 a month I thought that was astronomical I had a girlfriend my wife now we live together so it was 2,000 each and I was like that is insane $22,000 in rent I can that is just like that's evil I thought um now when I rent the place it's a bit more it I you know 10 or 12 or 13,000 sometimes when I go to um New York for the summer and so I increased my rent price my home that I live in in Austin I paid $900,000 for it so my monthly nut or my monthly mortgage and taxes I think it's 5,000 or or 6,000 somewhere in between that with taxes and so I think I increased my spend from like 10 to 15 a month to like 20 to 25,000 a month maybe 20,000 a month when I'm not in New York so I don't spend what I think is a significant amount of money I don't have any car payments I have two cars a Tesla and a Mercedes those are paid off I have a cleaning lady who comes once a week that's $120 a week um I do some health stuff so I have a fancy gym and I go to fancy doctors collectively that's a ,000 a month I don't own any jewelry I I wear I'm wearing a fresh clean tea it's a $10 t-shirt I wear those constantly um so I don't buy a lot of fancy things so my burn I think is relatively low um um when I go out to eat I don't look at prices and when I go to Whole Foods I buy the fanciest stuff and that's basically besides that I budget everything else out and so like I have a my wife is like insane about this stuff she has a drawer full of coupons so we went to Costco this weekend because we had a $20 off or something like that coupon so we still use coupons or coupons um but it has not changed significantly I guess one significant thing I hate flying I do not like to fly at all so typically if I have to go somewhere even if it's like 12 hours away I tend to drive I do not like to fly when I fly now I fly business class um and so that makes a $300 flight $800 something like that but my increase expenses rent went up um um business class but I don't fly often um and then my home doesn't have fancy Furnishing my whole house cost $30,000 to furnish so it hasn't really changed significantly other than my confidence my confidence has changed significantly the idea of like creating something from nothing that changed significantly how was that did that answer those two questions love loved every minute of it so now you can get out of the hot seat on your personal life and I'm going to throw to you the this was the most liked question so what were were your alternative business ideas if you didn't do Hampton so I um I'm I think I mentioned this last podcast there's this thing called eeky guy that I'm totally bought into I'm very fascinated with Japanese culture Japan has this like this philosophy where I think I said it last time it was like a vend diagram of like what the world wants what the world wants to pay for what you're good at what you love doing I try to find something in the middle one thing that I'm obsessed about is data and numbers I really am um like I if you search if you go to my personal blog which don't judge I started when I was 21 and I quit blogging there but I used to have this document called the CEO document and I tracked hundreds and hundreds of people I read lots of biographies and I tracked when they're born when they started their apprenticeship when they found success and then like what the success was and I made these like in-depth databases I'm obsessed with databases I'm obsessed with researching things so I have hundreds of PAG pages of my notion document where I deconstruct how different companies work so I thought about creating a research company or database company the the the reason I didn't start it was because I couldn't find an appropriate problem to solve for so I have all these databases of information and I like to analyze them and figure out what they mean but I couldn't find a good use case or I couldn't find a reason why people would pay money for it other than it's interesting but I sought out like for six months like different companies in the space and I couldn't figure out the right like go to market strategy so I wanted to start a database company or research company because I love it I thought about starting a media company I do have a non-compete so I can't start like a business news email for another one year I think um and so I couldn't do that and so I kind of fell into Hampton because I thought it was a it was perfect in my little eeky guy it was like what I'm good at what the world wants but I was really obsessed with research businesses we just had Jason yanowitz in the Pod this episode will go live but he came uh the episode before this and I asked him a lot about research businesses I think they could be really big I also think that there's not a lot of like youngish entrepreneurs attacking that space because it's a pretty stodgy old space that hasn't had a significant amount of innovation and I'm but I'm very fascinated by it so research in databased businesses is what I wanted to do one of my favorite examples is CB insights I love CB insights I love pitchbook I love those companies and I wanted to build something like that all right I got to tell you about one thing that's one of the great joys of my life you I'm not a cars guy and I'm not a watch guy but there's one thing that gives me a lot of joy and that is having a virtual assistant uh you know here's the scenario I'm running my companies and even though I'm supposed to be this uh CEO we all know I spend 20 30% of my time just doing random stuff that is not high value but it's just tedious it's stuff that has to get done but it's not creativity it doesn't require me and it doesn't add a bunch of value to the business it's just stuff just stuff that has to get done and so that stuff is what a virtual assistant does like just this week alone you know I lose my wallet so she goes to the DMV website fills out a bunch of forms gets me a new license or um you know every morning people have their morning coffee I have my morning metrics and my morning metrics are basically all the business metrics that I care about compiled she goes she finds them from all the different sources puts it in Excel sheet takes a screenshot texts it to me so that when I wake up in the morning I don't go on Twitter or check my email I'm looking at what what are the metrics at and what do I need to do I'm focused on the right things so having a virtual assistant is a no-brainer whether it's travel booking email inbox or just knocking stuff off your personal to-do list that would have just lingered there forever um I think it's a no-brainer if you're a business owner you should definitely do it um I I think one of the best places to find assistant is Shepard so go to support shepard.com you know I pay my assistant I think $8 an hour something like that that's double what she was making in her previous job so it's a win for her and for me it's super affordable it's something that um you know you don't need to have the biggest business ever be the biggest big shot in order to afford it so it's amazing I now do this for my co and my CMO too like I just give them assistance without them even asking because I know it makes them more productive that's it does that for me so of course it's going to do that for them too so go to support.com check them out um get an assistant and tell them I sent you they'll take good care of you if you do that so sport.com check it out our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best hub spot grow better okay this next question I love although it's painful for me even to ask it because it's really it it cuts deep uh this comes from Omar what was the most painful thing someone told you and how did it change you okay I saw that question and I was trying to think of a good answer answer my answer is boring so my best friend his name's Neville madora I met him because he had a great blog on copywriting and one year in 2013 I think it was 14 I cold emailed them and I said Neville my name is Sam I'm going to host this conference and I want you to come speak and I'm going to pay for your flight and I'm going to take care of your accommodation well the conference was really like 15 of my friends hanging out talking and I bought him a $250 Southwest flight and he slept on my couch and we became best friends after that and when he was there at my in my couch I gave him a towel to like take a shower and it was like a moldy towel and he was like dude you are disgusting you're acting like this bachelor 23y old which you are but like you need to be a man you need to get your act together this is disgusting and I remember that changed my life when he and so I like got together some of my like my uh my domestic skill set I also so like I was like I need to act like a man I need to dress better I need to like be more appropriate like I get I got to get my act together so that helped me a ton he also Neville does this a lot he criticizes me all the time but in a really nice way where he's like I'm going to tell you this because I love you but I'm going to give you feedback and another thing was when I met this woman that he was like dating or maybe one of his friends I think it was one of his friends he was like you're asking way too many intense questions the first time you meet someone you need to chill and quit talking about work and that was like painful to hear because that was my identity and so that changed how I uh had conversations and so he's done a good job Neville's eight uh six years older than me so he's kind of done a good job of like being my brother a little bit and like teaching me how to like act like a man so that was like a good thing I remember when I started my first company the hustle and this CEO of a large multi-billion dollar media startup that everyone knows I'm not going to call him out he told me I go I'm going to start this thing called The Hustle I think it could become a huge thing he said this will never make more than a million dollars a year just come and join my company and I was so hurt because I admired this guy so much and my admiration for him turned to hatred not really hatred but like rage I was like I wna like I want to destroy you now and the reason I thought that was because I was so hurt my feelings were so hurt that this guy that I admire just totally on me and he was wrong but I believed him for like 6 months I like doubted everything I was like this is stupid but he told me that he won't even remember saying this this guy by the way he probably made he thought it was like an off-handed comment or that something like that but it hurt my feelings so badly that I remember that uh like terribly and then the last thing was like anytime a girlfriend has ever like broken up with me that like that has always like stung me I I I I'll remember that for for decades like I'm still like trying to like prove them wrong so like I'm pretty sensitive uh to like rejection yeah for sure the most painful moments always come from high school I think everyone can agree with that yeah like high school and college girlfriends where you're still trying to figure out yourself a little bit and they like and you get and and they're right like you're not doing things the right way but and they're rejecting you it's like H it's the most painful thing ever girls are so brutal okay this next question is from Caitlyn what is one trendy business model uh you think is overhyped um I think the nft and web 3 stuff is just complete nonsense I think it's inferior entrepreneurs slapping their web 3 name on crap that no one wants and hoping that it's going to work so but everyone knows that now um I think um what's overhyped I think starting a newsletter is really popular right now most people don't realize it is a treadmill it is very challenging to create new content just like this podcast it's hard this is a hard job I like it because I think I'm good at it or I'm decent but it is very challenging any type of content business very very very very hard to do for like two or three years um and newsletter the the newsletter space significantly different than when I started it is way more competitive way more challenging so I think that is a bit overhyped although I would still start one because I like it I think that most of the people in the space are not going to work and it's pretty bad their content stinks because it's just a rinse and repeat of what already has existed so so I think that's quite overhyped I would say getting popular on the internet can be awesome because you get an audience but um in general I think that creating businesses based off your or like getting popular on Twitter and and Instagram and things like that I think it's incredibly empty feeling for most people and I think it's complete nonsense and your time would be spent building a company or focusing on your family than getting popular on social media I think it's empty I think that it's like small boy stuff I just and I find it incredibly uninteresting and there's many days that I regret trying to like become popular on the internet okay are you up to do one more we'll do one more okay this one comes from Jared seed he is moving to San Francisco he's curious about this idea of proximity to power so he's moving to SF with the clear intention of start a company and Surround himself with high Achievers his question is what did you do when you arrived d uh or what did Shan do when he arrived in SF to start laying the foundation to meet interesting people and business Builders moving to a big city when you are young and have no family I think is absolutely awesome my time I lived in SF for 8 years I got angry at the government and I left because it was dangerous otherwise I would still be there in a heartbeat I have no problem paying the high taxes in order to live there I think it's a beautiful place I would still even go back there today if my wife wanted to maybe so 100% worth it I loved it um what I did when I got there was I went to meetup.com and I went to Crazy amounts of meetups I also did uh I started an event so I created it's so funny CA cuz it's so sea is one of my best friends sea has a business that does like close to 100 million a year in Revenue we've had him on the Pod you guys maybe have heard of him um he so I created this book club called the anti- MBA and the idea was we're going to read one book per month and we're going to break it up into quarters so week one we're going to read a quarter and discuss it week two the the second half or whatever and I would have an expert come in on the book's topic and we would just shoot the uh with like 30 or 20 people on this book and I um posted ads on Craigslist on meetup.com and where else I think I bought an ad in the newspaper for like $200 like I just posted these ads and sea was one of the people who replied and after doing that for every week for about a year I had an email list of like 2,000 people who were like following this book club online because I would write out my notes from the the meeting and doing that book club changed my life so I just hosted a book club and it was awesome it was so good it was uh such a fun way to meet interesting people and so that's what I did in order to meet interesting people is we just read cool books and we brainstormed and talked about them most people by the way didn't even read the book they just wanted to talk about it because I wrote notes ahead of time on like I wrote a summary on the book so that changed my life the way that I met Shawn was I had this event called hustle con and there was this article in TechCrunch about monkey Inferno which was this incubator that Shawn ran and I saw a picture of the his office and it was magnificent and I cold email Sean and I said hey man um I'm hosting this event can I host the pre- dinner at your office we we'll take care of all the food I'll even hire some someone to clean it up but can I just like host it at your sick office and in exchange you can come to the dinner and meet all these wonderful speakers and attendees and he said yes and that's how I met Shawn and so I think what I did what I think more people should do is you just reach out to tons of people and I would say don't even reach out to like Ballers or people who are like ahead of you find other peers who seem like they got the juice who got the the Charisma or who have who seem like they're going someplace like for me it was Ryan Hoover Ryan Hoover started this thing called Product hunt we were buddies before he even started it and I've got lots of friends that are now incredibly successful um where we were just all like losers who were ambitious but we had nothing and we and I did a good job of like cold emailing those types of people and we hung out a lot and we just I I became wonderful friends with them and it was through my book club it was through cold emailing Twitter wasn't popular I didn't even have a Twitter back then so I just cold emailed tons of people and I would highly recommend that's what you do is find peers who you think are going to go places and you guys all try to succeed together and you try to be pretty selfless in the sense of like um like when I hosted my events they all volunteered to help me out when they needed something I helped them and so just like succeeding together I think was a really big deal now the issue is that takes like 10 years or 15 years but it's worth it um and you're not doing it just because someone's going to be successful like I had friends who are artists and like they financially weren't successful but it was just people who were like kicking their dent in the universe and that was addicting to be around that and we all kind of did it together and that's what what I did I had a book club the anti- MBA is what it was called because I was so jealous of the I I didn't go to a fancy school I remember when I moved to San Francisco I took a bus out or a train out to Stanford because I was like I want to see what this shit's about like what's what's so special about this place and I felt like in awe and I was like so jealous that I didn't know what Stanford even was when I was in high school so I was like I need to create my own Stanford cuz I'm jealous of all these people that went here and so that was kind of the idea it was the anti- MBA it was for and I organized it so I would suggest book clubs meetup.com I don't know is meetup.com still a thing I bet you it is right now when I was in San Francisco I went there like six months ago and there was and someone someone like recognized me and they go Sam I love the Pod we're hosting a AI Meetup and a hackathon right now do you want to come and my wife and I were like yeah let's go and so we just you got a car here we were like at the farmers market and they're like yeah I was like all right come on I'm going with you and so we went to this guy's Meetup and it was magical I met all these AI people who I knew nothing about and it was magical to be in those meetups at these places where you have like uh a homogeneous group of people working on something that is not mainstream it felt really magical so I I would say go to those events right awesome book club another thing that you and Oprah have in common I love it yes we have a lot in common me and Oprah so there were a lot of other questions we didn't get to but we'll do another one a little later let me know if you guys like this stuff [Music] peace

and the real story of block was I went home that afternoon I was like I'm launching a consulting firm to help companies figure out ethereum hours after learning about ethereum [Music] um all right we're live this is it this is how we start Ben we get in you just rip into it huh we get right into it where are you calling from your place looks nice is this your apartment yeah yeah this is the blockworks office yeah we got a new office like about a year ago in Manhattan how many um how many people do you have like 60 uh I think we're up to 65 maybe we had six people start this week so I think I think that might put us at 65. what's the pitch for what you are you're just uh I mean at the high level a crypto media company but what did I tell you the other day I go you do everything right you do things the right way wait let me just get this straight so is Sean not joining us because do you know that Sean told John dm'd me one day he gave me his cell phone he said dude hit me up would love to meet and chat I've never met the guy I he he gives me a cell phone I text him I go yo it's Jason it's what's up man I said something about friend Tech Guy ghosted me never just left me on red really this was gonna be my time on air to call out Sean but alas well you called him out no Sean's out Sean's getting a nose job he's out with surgery this week really yeah but but he'll he'll hear this all right Sean's a ghoster man Sean is a ghost or I give him a heart for I give him a hard time for that but you know he brings the heat so he he gets a pass so what are we talking today I don't know man tell people like you're under the radar but your business is shockingly big and I think it's going to be incredibly successful what do you what's like the pitch for what blockworks is block work started six years ago so my co-founder Mike and I started it in December of 2017. basically the thesis back then which Remains the Same I think we've got a lot wrong over the years but one thing we got really right was the thesis uh which was that crypto as an asset class and as an industry is going to grow exponentially over the coming years and this was back in 2017 when most of the information about the asset class was basically like siled on Reddit and Twitter and our thesis was that as the industry grew exponentially those investors who and professionals who came into the industry they weren't gonna you know listen to crypto Panda or like crypto whale about this new asset class they wanted this professional source of information kind of like a Bloomberg or Wall Street Journal for crypto so yeah we said hey let's go build it and that was six years ago so what we've built is basically for the first five years we've built a media media platform Media company right we own the largest Network podcasts in the industry we have a couple big newsletters we have uh I think the best team of reporters uh and you know journalists in the industry we own a couple of the large conferences in the industry and we've built this big media company and a year ago we thought the industry was ready for like deeper what I call almost like bottom of the funnel information about crypto data analytics research protocol governance and that is our subscription platform that we launched called blockworks research so that was a year ago so that's what yeah we're a median information platform just about crypto crypto native media and information company do you say how big you are did you see the research my guy so I have Eugenio he's my uh yeah he like had your revenue and ebitda was that all right correct yeah it's crazy I like he's doing like he's that guy's digging he said the 2023 you're going to do 25 million in Revenue with 8 million in ebitda he says 2022 you did 25 and 7 million in ebitda is that right I'm not going to say specific numbers but what I will say is yeah last year we had a goal of uh 20 million in revenue and we pretty decently exceeded that um and we've been profitable since day one so yeah we bootstrapped the business for the first five and a half years and then back in April or May we took uh we raised our first outside round of capital from from 10t and framework and uh this Angel Santiago so we raised 12 million bucks out of 135 valuation um and yeah we've been profitable since then I mean kind of since we started we did a decent bit of Evita last year this year uh those numbers are wrong because this year just to kind of share a little bit of insights into like the crypto Market I don't know how I think you followed pretty closely Sam the Market's just gotten crushed right so what's actually done really well for us this year is our subscription revenue on the research platform but the ad market across the board both in crypto and digital media if you probably talked to the morning Brew guys or you probably saw the BuzzFeed numbers because they're public like it's got It's it's uh it's been a tougher year than last year on the ad Market is it coming back now it's the ad Market is just starting to come back yeah but you guys crush it on conferences I mean I went to your conference what did you have 5 000 people there the conference the final number was a little above 4 000 this year yeah I mean that was amazing you it seems like you filled it there um yeah I mean I think that like I'm a media nerd I I think that everyone who has a media business ever works in the media business they hate it and they love it uh I hate it but it's like an art that I'm addicted to um I hate selling ads but I love creating media and when I look at you know media is an interesting business because the barrier to entry is really low particularly for the written word well even for podcasts everyone can write therefore everyone the the pool of people who think they're good writers is significantly higher than like building some other type of business um and I think that most people do it really poorly myself included I made a lot of mistakes but whenever like you're telling me about your guys's business I'm like oh I see a well from an outside I see a crystal clear path to like 100 million in sales um you just do the same [ __ ] but more and more and you just are thoughtful man you do things right and I I think that you're one of the more under the radar operators in the space thanks man that's why I think a digital media business is actually one of the best businesses to start it's not going to make you a billionaire there's no like go start you had the you had the the the flying guy on the podcast the other day like that's what you'd go through if you want to be a billionaire like a digital media brand I think is like the best Venture into entrepreneurship for first-time Founders and Mike and I like Mike and I were just roommates at the time and we were 23 when we launched the business we basically just worked we would wake up at like 4 a.m we'd jump on LinkedIn we had no media business we didn't even know what media was we just we just wanted to host an event because we went to an event realized they made like 5 000 bucks that was big money to us and so we just jumped on LinkedIn every morning we would wake up and just send like 300 messages right 10 of those people reply that's 30. you get like three out of the 30 to actually buy a ticket our first event February 2018 we had 220 people and we made Top Line 12 000 bucks I think it was and so that's that's Off to the Races and then we ended up building the a media company basically asked backwards right like how you probably started with the hustle was with content yeah you you did it horribly horribly horribly horrible I would argue though like the problem with most media companies and the reason they don't work is because they're started by folks who can't monetize so they're usually started by a podcast host or a newsletter writer in 2023 and they're brilliant content and they don't understand how to sell so what happens is they're a year and a half in they're like oh [ __ ] I need to monetize and they don't know how to build a business they know how to create great content and for us we did events then we linked up with pomp right and we that we got into the podcasting game so our first podcast was pumps well it used to be called off the chain now it's called the pom podcast but you're just selling ads for him right we were doing everything I would go into Palms office seven days a week Saturdays and Sundays too I would put the mic in front of his face I learned how to use GarageBand I was editing the podcast I was producing the podcast we were designing the things on 99 designs I was selling the sponsorships we were doing all of it um and then we built that business out and hosted shows for other people realized that business was great for Avenue sucked for IP because we don't actually own the content yeah you're just an agency yeah then covet hit and 80 of our Revenue got wiped out overnight because we were 80 of Revenue came from events and then that's when we pivoted into like we said let's go do the media thing how much could you say how many how many uh how much in sales you're you're like one event would do um yeah our biggest one I mean last year we did like well over 10 million from permissionless dude that's insane man my whole thing with events was I started with hustle cone hustlecon so I did it the same thing as you where like I threw it together and hosted it in six weeks I think the first time I did it I think I did 50 000 in revenue and like 20 000 in profit the second time I did it I think it did a hundred and sixty thousand in Revenue and 50 000 in profit maybe and then the third and fourth time it varied between like 500 000 and a million I think in sales and then I don't remember what the profit was but the margins got smaller and events were hard I was like I know these events can get big but I screwed it up because what I did was I made the event about I just like looked at like I had never been to conferences I just looked at what a TED Talk was and I was like I'm just gonna do that I'm just gonna get people on a stage and people are gonna sit in the audience and like listen to this that was really dumb for from a money making point of view that was a really stupid thing to do and I knew that some of these events were doing like tens of millions in sales and I totally screwed it up the the way that you really make revenue and income through these events is the speakers are simply a way to get the similar like-minded people in the in the audience and you make money through more expensive ticket sales because you're doing networking and you make money not through sponsorships people call them sponsorships but like through like a booth so they could actually it like it's basically just a Marketplace that day where like you have to make people are making deals conferences are basically just uh three-day marketplaces where you build the marketplace and you shut it down three days later and that's what the show floor is Sheldon Adelson so there's this guy named Sheldon I think his name's Sheldon Adelson Ximena just died he started this thing called uh Comm decks I think it was and it was eventually turned into CES I think it like uh rebranded but anyway he created this conference called comdex and it was like the computer show or something a computer it was right when computers were getting popular in the 70s 80s and 90s he built it up he actually sold it for a billion dollars but Sheldon adelson's the guy who basically made the Vegas Strip like it made it happening because what he noticed was he goes oh wow this conference I'm basically just creating like a it's basically a real estate business because I'm creating a Marketplace and I'm like a merchant in the sense of like I'm selling like Corner space because that's the best space that I'm selling this space and like Marketplace it's a Marketplace for those few days and then he's like well [ __ ] I'm just going to get into real estate industry because he saw like loads of different parallels and uh anyway when I like read that I was already like pretty deep into like my one big event and I was like [ __ ] I did this all wrong you know what I mean I don't even think you did it wrong you just needed to go bigger so the secret with events so we started with small events the thing that a lot of entrepreneurs get wrong with events is the business model of small events is a is a really good experience for attendees it's really fun you bring people together good community building it is a [ __ ] business model so the kind of secret to events is you need to figure out how to go really big and go bigger and bigger and bigger and what we found out some early insights was let's say you have a company like uh like coinbase right and coinbase might pass a million dollars to sponsor our conference if we launched another conference they're not going to go past 2 million they're going to take that million that they allocate to their blockworks conference budget and they're going to cut it in half so then they're spending 500 with us here and 500 with us here so but we're doing twice the work right to go run two conferences so we basically Consolidated all of our things we now just have two conferences digital asset Summit and permissionless and the reason for that is like that is the best business model for conferences is bigger is better what's really tough is um big conferences you have to plan out years in advance so our events team would like us to book venues like four or five years out we can't do that because crypto's too cyclical so we but we still have to like I think we just booked our 2026 venue or or we're like about we have we have the contract for them so and why that's really tough for our business is because crypto is so cyclical and if you think you're planning a big event but you don't end up having you're not able to host the big event you can crush your business right coindesk almost died in 2019 because of that reason um they had like I don't know 10 000 plus people in 2018 and then in 2019 they fell to like 2 000 people right they fell eighty percent and that almost wiped out their whole business and their takeaway from that was hey maybe events big events aren't going to come back big events aren't going to be big like crypto events just aren't going to be big again and what happened is you end up losing money on the upside when the when the market comes back you lose money on the upside so for us like it's just a big challenge to running a conference business in such a cyclical industry is you have to plan these things years in advance but then you're basically asking yourself to like predict Market Cycles very tough thing to do but you're big enough now that like you said that like cities are like courting you right yeah so these the bigger your conference gets the more GDP you bring into a city so I forget the I forget the specific number but I think for Palm Beach last year we brought in like I don't know three or four or five or six million dollars of GDP to Palm Beach just in those three days so they so they're the mayor of Palm Beach came to our conference he really wanted us to come back um and the bigger your conference gets the more cities and then even countries will Court like countries will Court like web Summit and money 2020 and folks like that and they'll give them big upfronts how much do you think that up front was for a web Summit web Summit has what 50 000 people yeah a couple couple million probably I don't know five five million maybe 10 maybe some money in tax credits that's insane man I um yeah yeah I mean like I I haven't cracked the code for an event but you have that's why that's why I like hanging out with you but like it's freaking stressful it is stressful that's one of the reasons why I hate events yeah 50 of tickets get sold in the four in the four weeks leading up to a conference so imagine the fifth week out from a conference you're basically thinking that 50 of your attendees aren't coming and you know it because there's six years of data that they're gonna come but it's stressful but ultimately the conference serves as like it's the reason we were able to bootstrap the business right it serves as like the cash flow into the podcasts and into the research business and into the digital and news and all that stuff and uh another thing that I like about hanging out with you so like basically for The Listener I uh I spend my summers in Brooklyn one year Jason was like hey there's this uh apartment in my building that's available you want to rent it out and I was like hell yeah so I lived three floors below you for about four months hung out with you a bunch and an interesting thing about you is you're one of the better storytellers I've ever hung out with Sean Sean Perry partner Sean awesome it's awesome at telling stories you've you've told some of the craziest stories I've ever heard of particularly one about when you like won a did you win a Corvette oh man so I was super I was nervous for this podcast not because I'm nervous to go on podcasts but uh I was telling Dana last night I was like I'm actually pretty nervous for this podcast Sam knows too much about me to to make this I'll give you I'll give you I'll give you a pass on anything anything you don't want to talk about you know and I asked you ahead of time I said what don't you want to talk about I'll share anyone I think Sean and I joke we're like if you were like really good at gaming if you were like good at poker if you like were a hacker if you did like most people not most but a lot of people who end up with like huge amounts of financial success they were doing something like gray early in their career before they realized like oh I actually like follow the book and like do things by the rules because that is way better for long-term success but they had that like Gene in them a hundred percent you told this story and when I heard that story I was like oh yeah like it would have been obvious at the age of 16 or 18 that you were gonna be like a massive success when you told me this story it was one of the crazier things I've ever heard of I'll tell I'll tell an abbreviated version because I don't I don't think it's as interesting as you do but I've always had this company don't don't give me the abbreviated version I've always had this entrepreneurial tick like I um my parents shared this story with me the other day I guess when I was in like fourth or fifth or sixth grade or something I would buy this is not the story I'll get to the story but I would buy uh MLB Showdown cards on eBay that I thought they were marketing it poorly and like maybe the picture was bad or the description was bad I'd buy the MLB Showdown cards I'd take a nicer picture with a nice camera re-upload the exact same card to eBay with just a better picture and better marketing copy and sell it for like 2x what we bought what I bought it for so I've always had that kind of Bend this um has pulled me down good rabbit holes like that or like block works and then some less good rabbit holes which I think is the story you're getting to um somewhere after senior year of high school I summer after senior year of high school I wanted some money some summer money so I went to my parents was like hey can I get some money I'm in high school I don't have a job let me get some money they're like you're not you're not getting money we're not giving you money uh go my remember my mom said I think your friend Jake is getting a job at Taco Bell go work with Jake at Taco Bell I said I'm not going to Taco Bell and we we would go to Taco Bell every day I love Taco Bell and um so I was like I'm not going to I'm not working at Taco Bell so my buddy was a year above me in school and he would he uh he went to school at the University of Hawaii and he was back from his freshman year of college he's like hey I heard about this thing where it was actually the Soylent podcast guy uh or the Soylent Guy brought it up on his on your podcast with him it's he's like most companies spend like 40 of their budget on marketing these there are another type of company that spends zero on marketing 40 on Affiliates who Market their products for them and that was kind of the pitch that my buddy gave me he's like if you are able to sell this energy drink to other people you can make money you get like a percentage of what they make and again I'm 18. I didn't know anything I just wanted money and I didn't want to work at Taco Bell so I signed up I bought like 30 energy drinks and started telling people that like hey you drink Red Bull and Monster you should you shouldn't do that you should buy these healthy energy drinks from me go you go to like you know it's dot you know the web the website.com and uh anyways I I did it for a couple months didn't make any money I get to college I went to Emory down in Atlanta and I really didn't want to be like the energy drink guy you know I'm trying to be like cool on campus freshmen didn't want didn't want to be like the energy drink guy and uh I talked to some friends they didn't want to do it but then I discovered like digital marketing and actually like Noah Kagan and like all those people like that whole crowd they were kind of booming back in the day like they were just kind of finding some success and found that whole crowd of like that guy Branson something or Russell Brunson yeah figured out how to create landing pages um went super deep down that rabbit hole and the business got crazy so you got paid like a percentage this is where I didn't realize what I was doing looking back there's a lot of like I'm not sure if I would do this well I probably wouldn't do this again I actually think about like what I let my kid do this um in the future but yeah ended up having 4 600 people and my downline had like a thousand people in France um you know because it was it was a it wasn't that you were making money just selling this drink you're making money from enlisting people to sell it for you so basically it was a pyramid scheme multi-level marketing yeah you told the story you're like you I told my parents what I was doing and they're like Jason you know this is a a multi-level marketing you're like what do you mean I'm just selling a drink like you didn't even know what that meant right I so this company was the Like official sponsor of the Phoenix Suns The Dr Oz was on my if any of my friends from college are listening to us they're going to laugh at this because they have heard this pitch probably a thousand times I used to like get on Skype it wasn't Zoom back then it was Skype and I'd give this pitch to like a room of 500 people like Dr Oz says that you know a can of can of this and a handful of almonds is the healthiest thing that you can put in your body blah blah so they had all these big names I had no idea I really fell for the pitch that it was like look a lot of companies like a Nike spends billions on marketing why don't they just spend billions giving it to when Sam tells me about Nike they should give Sam like 10 of that 10 of that what I didn't realize was there's all these companies there's this multi-level Market I didn't realize that there's this whole industry three and it wasn't until well to to bring this story home and the car wasn't a Corvette as a BMW I got so high up in this company or had so many people below me the company gave me a BMW uh my sophomore year of college I I tried dropping out my sophomore year got like a 2.2 or 2.4 GPA my obviously my parents wouldn't let me they knew they they were like I later learned that it was a big debate my parents had about whether or not to let me keep doing this my mom wanted to shut it down from day one and my dad was like it'll teach him a good lesson I don't think they really I don't think they thought I was gonna be successful but it wasn't until uh Bill Ackerman and Carl Icahn got into that really crazy battle over Herbalife and I watched the full thing I watched the whole presentation by Bill Ackman that I realized I was like oh my God he is explaining this company that work that I'm working with and uh and then my and then my roommate junior year like one of my best friends like basically slapped me in the face junior year he's like all right man we're gonna get internships you should join us uh stop doing this stop doing this thing and and wish and it shut down so what is it how much money do you make if you have 4 000 people on your like downline or whatever it's called I was making probably a thousand fifteen hundred bucks a week as a sophomore but that's four thousand people so shitload of people I would have thought you'd make way more there were people making millions a year who had like if there I probably had four thousand on one side like 600 on the other if my sides were like even then um then it would I guess they probably did some model internally that has like made the company more sustainable if it was like even so yeah that's so that's what it was but I was I mean for I was 19 right I was a year and a half after wanting to work at Taco Bell or not wanting to work at Taco Bell so like that was crazy crazy money for me and you're just like giving speeches in front of hundreds of people on Skype about why this drink is is awesome or why the business is awesome basically the pit yeah kind of both like the so the difference between so you brought up pyramid scheme the like technical difference as The Regulators see it between a multi-level marketing company which is I would call very shady but technically legal versus a pyramid scheme which is illegal is the percentage of people who buy the product for the product itself versus the number of people the percentage of people who buy the product just to get access to be able to sell it and make more money so that's the like the reason something like Amway or like Herbalife can be still exist is because there's actually a pretty high percentage of people who just buy the products because they like the products like Cutco knives and all those so yeah is a multi-level Market I mean I've got a ton of friends that sold cut code knives and you know what's crazy they all say awesome stuff about the product so like an MLM isn't inherently or nothing right I think like it wasn't like Tupperware like uh this company had been around for 10 years that was the other thing it had been around for like 10 or 11 or 12 years and they sold to like 50 and 60 year olds who wanted to get like protein shakes and all that stuff and it was a really good product and nobody did the money part of it they just got it and they might tell some friends but like most people who use Amway products they don't tell their friends about it they just actually like the products so that was this company and then they realized hey who wants money more than anyone like 19 year old kids so they launched and what do 19 year old kids drink they drink energy drinks so that's when they launched that they did flashy marketing they sponsored the Suns they got Dr Oz as a spokesperson all this stuff and that's when it really that's when the percentage of people buying the product for the to make money started to outweigh the number of people buying the product for the for the drink how big was that company I don't know I don't I don't have metrics the CEO I think went to jail for a year or two though oh my god well it happens one of the things like I actually I wasn't even sure I wanted to talk about it on the podcast today because I have a lot of not regret but like it is inherently kind of a shady thing to talk about right it's like multi-level marketing is a shady thing and I didn't realize it at the time I truly I truly had no idea I'd like drank the Kool-Aid so hard I really had no idea and the debate I have I don't have any kids but if I had a kid would I let my kid do this and the immediate answer is no like that it is super Shady no but it did teach I I know for a fact I would not be here today if I hadn't done that why is that block work started by just me posting on LinkedIn a lot about crypto and nobody was posting on social nobody was posting on LinkedIn back then like it gave me the confidence to post on social a lot it gave me the like understanding that Mo does like most of growing a business at the beginning is just like grit and hustle and really marketing and sales it's less product eventually that changes over time as you find product Market fit and all that kind of stuff um and it just taught me this like it it made me realize that I there was nothing in the world I wanted to do outside of build a company and it gave me the I like I didn't I didn't know how to build a software company like you have some like Geniuses come on the show like they're coders like I wasn't like that um and it just gave me the confidence to go do it so were you thinking about any other different ideas before you started block works um yeah I was desperate for something I was really desperate for to do something but I had a bunch of [ __ ] ideas um I the way blockworks originally started who's the consultant that you had on the show ovens same ovens so the way block work started Sam Evans plays a role I wanted to start a Consulting practice because I saw I read Sam evans's stuff and I like I didn't buy his course but I saw all of his ads and I was like this dude's making it it was funny hearing that like New York photo shoot that he did you know what I'm talking about I like remember seeing that ad I was like obviously now I know how the game works that wasn't a real thing but he I I wanted to like do what Sam Evans did start a consulting firm by the way Sam Evans is this guy who came on our pod nowadays he's like a really nerdy like almost like an intellectual he started a software company and he's doing everything right but previously he started this thing called consulting.com he rented out this slick apartment slick back his hair wore a bright blue blazer and I don't think he did anything unethical but he was um like selling the dream he was like I started a Consulting business that makes money I'm gonna teach you how to do that too for this amount of money and he came on our pod and he was like I don't remember exactly what he said but I think the energy that I got from him was he's like I don't regret doing that because I helped a lot of people but I was playing a part that wasn't authentic to me and I got bummed out maybe there was a little like regret he's like I've [ __ ] played a part like I was an actor and I don't think he regrets it because I don't think he did anything wrong but he just pushed it to the to the Limit yeah so I saw those ads that's what I wanted to do I was like really sick of my job I wanted to do that and so I so I used to go to this thing called brunchwork or something in New York I don't think they exist anymore but I would go to all these events they had a thing on how to build a consulting firm at 2PM on a Sunday I think it was like 2 p.m on a Sunday they had a thing how to build a consulting firm I thought it was you just gets sucked into these like scabs one day if you ever talk to Mike I'll tell you about the uh the Jerry Seinfeld ticket ticket flipping scheme did not make money um anyways we uh I get there an hour early because I thought it was at 1pm and they were doing a talk on ethereum and I already knew about Bitcoin from since 2015 I was living in Budapest heard about Bitcoin 2017 this is 2017 now uh got really into ethereum from this talk and so I decided I went I came home that day and the real story of block was I went home that afternoon I was like I'm launching a consulting firm to help companies figure out ethereum hours after learning about ethereum hours after I was like sold the dream yeah um I was like this is what I've been looking for well I I you know I've known about Bitcoin for two years I was already like listening to bitcoin podcasts and stuff and like kind of had heard about ethereum but like didn't unders didn't click didn't get it and uh came home and I was living with four guys at the time and one of them was Mike who's my co-founder and I were we remember it slightly differently what I remember is him saying let's do it and then waking up in the morning and saying hey this is a horrible idea I currently work in Consulting nobody's going to buy Consulting from us because they don't trust us when we're 23 years old we need to build trust with the community how do we do that and I said great how do we do that he said what if we hosted events we went to that event last month that made some money so we started hosting events to then try to sell Consulting and six years later we have no Consulting but hey guys really quick so you may know this but my beginning in business was being a copywriter I'm a self-top copywriter and what that means is I figured out what motivated people and then I figured out how to use the written word to get them to do what I want them to do so that could mean selling them a product that could mean writing a speech or even giving a speech and giving someone to buy into a particular movement it could be recruiting hell you could do it for dating it just basically means figuring out what motivates someone and how to use the written word to take an action get them to take an action or to think a certain way and the way that I learned how to copyright was I did this thing called copywork and copywork is this famous technique that's not really popular anymore but it used to be really really popular and you basically take writing that is great writing that you love and you write it out by hand and you copy it and you make notes of what particular thing that that writer is doing that makes it special this is the exact same way that you learn how to play the piano when you want to learn how to play the piano you learn how to play Happy Birthday and then you learn how to play like Jingle Bells and then maybe like a rock and roll song and then maybe like a hip-hop song and eventually you can combine that all together after a few years and you learn how to make music that's your own same thing with writing that's how I learned how to write I locked myself in a room for six months and I just did this for many hours a day uh I created a program to make it easy so you could do that it's called copy that copy that.com you can go there and you can check it out it's a 10-day exercise to make it really easy to learn how to write if you want you can just go do this on your own you can find great writing you just literally copy it by hand I know it sounds crazy but it works really effectively but I made something that makes it a little bit easier so check it out copy that dot com and we will talk soon and back to the pod [Music] where's the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better dude it's so funny I think that like all right so blackworks is gonna be a huge success I don't know what how big but I believe you're gonna have a multi-hundred million dollar exit before the age of like 33 very likely what are you 28 now 29. you're going to be you're gonna be worth at least 100 million dollars in the next five years I would imagine liquid that's my prediction but in order to get there I think what people like we started I talk about sometime they're like there's this always like revisionist history of like oh I had this great idea when in reality uh like you just do dumbass like kind of Meathead stuff and you just kind of can iterate your way and then after like you get to like some type of sustainability in some type of Mastery you're like okay I actually clearly see the path now and like maybe I'll go back in time and say I had this like Revelation that we have to build this big thing you said your story earlier you're like I thought this I thought crypto was going to be a big thing but no one was covering it but in reality it was like ethereum sounds sick um I I need a job um I'm just gonna Host this event and see what happens like you know what I mean you just kind of like do [ __ ] and it works out sometimes there's always basically a so like that is true what I said about like we had this Vision that crypto would be this institutional asset class because once we said Hey how do you host an event what what should we talk about I think our first talk like one of our first friends was like crypto and the institutional age of blockchain or something like we had that Vision right but yeah I think you are dead right and I think that is a almost a problem that gets pushed is that everybody thinks that Founders had this vision from day one but if you talk to Founders who have built big companies 99 of them do not they do they never did at the beginning second time Founders actually do I've noticed like second time Founders will but um honestly like 100 of first-time Founders there's no Grand Vision it's this kind of it's this like how did blockworks get built I don't know we took one foot in front of the other day after day and like slogged it out and that's how you build your first company second company I think is different second company can be like you know Robotics and like all this other [ __ ] but that's you can have a Grand Vision but not the first company yeah I don't think it is I think that um I remember when I started my first the very first thing I started I was like I want to start a newsletter and then I had this horrible idea I just read the biography of Ted Turner and he like employed all these people and I was like that sounds amazing I want to employ 10 000 people and then I had like a team of 10 and I'm like no I definitely don't want ten thousand of these [ __ ] hanging around like this is just too hard yeah and like he inspired me but I'm like oh my God I don't want all these people and and I just made so many mistakes but then the second or third time around you definitely have a more Clear Vision you also have more um you have more uh you have more wisdom and and that shows up in the sense of like look like after we do this for like two or three years I have a feeling we're gonna be able to do this in like five years like you have a little bit more Vision but you know it's still pretty murky but you also have a lot more patience and Trust in the in the cycle or in the evolution because things evolve but when you're first starting stuff you like you're like this isn't even gonna work to get to point B let alone like they get about Point C and D you know what I mean a hundred percent I think that's a big fallacy and I think the other one is um this idea that it gets easier as you grow right that's um I think anyone startups are like this weird or being a Founder is this weird thing where like I think what they you kind of hold constant the rate at which you can tolerate problems and everything else kind of becomes this variable that moves and you're always as a Founder in this zone of Max Payne and whenever you are able to if you're ever below that threshold of Max Payne you take on more stuff and I think that is that's something I thought at the beginning which was like when blockworks Hits 10 people oh man it'll be a lot easier all right when blockworks hits like 30 people a lot easier and that's um I don't know just listening to Patrick Collison the founder of stripe on a podcast but dude's in Max Payne right now you think so oh yeah oh yeah he is reading between the lines of that company it he is in Max Payne and uh doesn't get any easier so do you have you read the have you read the Elon Musk biography I'm reading right now I'm like 200 pages in I haven't started it yet but all my friends keep talking about it and his life sounds miserable he does it does not I wouldn't trade I wouldn't trade what he has for in a million years I would I it sounds miserable um like his personal life sounds awful his professional life sounds awful everything about it sounds bad it does not sound enjoyable in the slightest can I flip the script am I allowed to ask you a question here so this is a conversation you guys were talking with the soil and guy about like what you're optimizing for basically um and you guys are like some people optimize for money right some people are optimizing for happiness some people are like he said the things like you you know every person has a duty to make a big impact on the world so some people are I did not agree with him I did not agree I know you called him out on that but what are what are you because you're doing Hampton again you Pro I don't you probably have enough money where you could just sit on it and put it in some like treasuries for the rest of your life but you're doing Hampton again what are you optimizing for I'm optimizing for fulfillment so I'm uh so when I took time off after selling my first company I was incredibly lonely I was very I think I think they're Scott Galloway talks about like a loneliness uh epidemic particularly amongst young men and I I experienced that where I was like I'm just so low I feel alone I I feel like uh quite unhappy um I felt proud of my previous experience but I felt lonely and so I started the business because I wanted um a new challenge where like I just wanted to achieve something and I wanted to succeed at something but more so I wanted to be less lonely and I wanted to be in the trenches with the troops and like create something together um I think that uh young men I imagine young women but I'm a young man so I don't know that perspective is that like I need something to chase after with a team of of people who I enjoy being near um and that's really what I was optimizing for I'm also optimizing for um um living life on my own terms um so the reason why I'm not willing to do like this what John said what did he say he was like you got to build something big I'm like dude I don't want that because I feel like you're signing up you're signing up to live a life where you where you have so like there's like three things there's like what do you want to do what should you do and what do you have to do and I only want to spend my time doing like the things I have to do and the things I want to do I don't want to do things that I should do so let's just say that you have a huge company with 10 000 employees you have to do you should be doing lots of meetings with them you should be talking to your investors I don't want to do any of that there's [ __ ] in my life that I have to do like no matter what I'm okay with some of those but I want to maximize my time for things that I want to do and so that's kind of what I'm maximizing my life for is is spending my time how I want to spend it not things that I should be doing does that make sense yeah it does make sense yeah and I think that when you sign up for those I think that like Brett Adcock was on the Pod yesterday or Monday and he's this guy who goes big the thing about him is I believe he's happy like he's doing what he wants to be doing I listened he sounds like it and I'm happy that freaks like him exist but I am not that person I like I don't want to go into the warehouse or his Factory on a Sunday and like mess with robots that's just not how I find fulfillment I would rather read a book and be by myself on a Sunday so like I I just don't I don't want to like sign up to those big uh world-changing ideas because I feel like you're obligating yourself to live a life for other people do you know what I mean I do not even is that how you feel kind of I think fulfillment's a good way to put it but if I had to like distill that into a couple different things like well first off there's Safety and Security in starting your own business um I think it is a one one idea that is in like people's heads in the U.S especially people who like graduate from good schools and they go into like the workforce that has been broken in the last year which is going to be really interesting to see how this plays out is that working at like a big tech company is a safe thing to do like the number of people have been laid off from like big Tech and from Banks and stuff like that recently is um is incredibly high right and so I actually think there's more Safety and Security and doing something that you own and where you can like manage 100 of the risk like you can be the best employee somewhere and if all hell breaks loose and like the companies doesn't have a good business model you can get let go so I think there's Safety and Security in doing your own thing I think there's autonomy like just the type of Personality that I am I've never done one of those like Myers-Briggs things but I'm sure it would say I need my own autonomy like I could I would not work well in other companies I would say um and then I think there's this like need to I think building a company is also like a very personal growth type of thing um and I think you like you there's no way block Works can grow if Mike and I don't become better as humans and I like that it's this forcing function to become a better person yeah and I think in some in a weird sense and I don't want to like Grand like act like this is some like big world changing idea or that like what I'm doing isn't selfish but um it's almost like being an artist you know I joke about it I'm like dude just like give Pablo Picasso like a freaking tuba and he'll make art out of it like and and that's sometimes how I feel about when I'm playing on the internet yeah we were talking about like different ideas that you were you're takering with or that you're like different opportunities that you're spotting what uh what interests you at the moment you're not gonna go and start anything because you have a full-time gig but is what interests you I mean though like just crypto right now I'm like head like just super deep into crypto I think there are other startup ideas like if if someone waved a wand today and said you couldn't go work in you couldn't go work in crypto um what would I do I would probably there's probably two maybe three things there's only two things I would look at that I think are huge opportunities first off you remember when everyone started creating like the Uber for X like the Uber for whatever I think we're about to see that with um with beehive actually what is that what does that mean do you have this newsletter platform that's just like a 10 times better newsletter platform than anything on the market I know you are friends with the convert kit guys so sorry sorry to him I like Tyler I like convertkit too or I like uh beehive too I'm also super biased because I'm an investor in beehive but like we don't use it yet because it'll be Enterprise scale soon but it's more for like the individual creating their their newsletter all they did is they just had a super deep understanding of newsletters right Tyler was I think CTO of morning grew before this they just had a super deep understanding right deep domain expertise and then they just built a really slick UI ux and a really deeply technological like technologically more powerful platform than anything that exists on the market and I think you're going to start to see people basically say hey beehive was able to do this in newsletters where there's all these platforms right campaign monitor send grids sale through convert kit sub stack and they just did a 10 built a 10 times better product I think you're going to see people try to do this for other Industries if I were doing it I would do it for conferences we have used six different ticketing Platforms in six different years of block works and it's always been we like our current one actually kind of a little bit right now um but in the past it's just been a nightmare to find a ticketing platform and there's this company called hop in that uh was like one of the hottest startups of the year a couple years ago during during covet I heard the founder took 100 million dollars in secondary yeah he did he did I actually heard it was even more than that but he um that's insane yeah it's insane they raised a seven billion valuation they just sold for 15 million so down from 7 billion to 15 million so it happened sold for you should you should fact check me on this but I think for 15 million no way no way yeah ring central uh acquires hop-in events and session products for 15 million holy [ __ ] and the founder took over 100 million dollars in secondary uh funding yeah dude he won that one yeah he did win oh my God anyways that's um that's what I would do so I think hoppin kind of hoppin could have dominated this Market but they had this stupid thesis that virtual events were going to take over physical events which was like the dumbest thing I've ever heard and um and and so they failed but if they had just built a better product for event hosts and conferences that was just a 10 times better product that's a that's a philosophy business that's a [ __ ] business that's a good business no I don't think it is I think that like if you look at Eventbrite look at their their market cap I I haven't looked at them forever I'm pretty sure it's been like slow growth I also think um are you looking it up let me know I also think that um there's this company called Splash do you remember Splash splashthat.com oh yeah you're right you're right I remember I think they rebranded the splash so it was it was great it was like Eventbrite but they just made a Slicker landing page for cheap or free events and it was great it was really fun I I created so many events with splash I think splash.com and I have no idea if they still exist and the problem with them is that most of or I I think the problem was is that most events are like ten dollars or forty dollars or something like that and they could only earn like three percent or two percent or some number like that of the ticket sales and it seemed like a really small business that raised tens of millions of funding that never came to fruition uh so that's a good that's a good pushback I would go Enterprise so the reason I think probably Eventbrite so the reasons flashlight didn't work is because they were trying to sell to like random people just setting up events it was kind of like a party full if you know party full now and then like they were kind of flirting with with yeah so many people are using that I I don't think that will work they were kind of flirting with Enterprise but like weren't really doing it Eventbrite like they're probably cost of support alone is like a total nightmare um just because they have like anyone can go create an event on on on uh you know what you know it's a better comparison Sam bizibo I would just go make like a 10 times better bizabo what's bizibo it's an Enterprise events platform it's like it's they sell like SAS it's like 20K a year 30k year subscription you host all your platform your events on them they don't take a cut of the fee of the of the ticket sales I don't think it's just a but the platform sucks it's a [ __ ] product um but they just dominate the Enterprise event space right now why are you interested in hair transplants uh the rate of balding in men right now uh the hair transplant hair transplant space is the one of the fastest growing markets um in in all of medicine right now hold on I have I was actually researching this before this um did you ever get Lasik eye surgery no I'm afraid to do it I should do it but I'm afraid so Lasik 20 years ago was this like kind of sketchy thing to do or maybe 25 years ago and now it is so the success rate is 99.9 the costs have come down 95 for surgery and everybody gets Lasik it's like a thousand bucks or something like that but before it was way more expensive and way riskier and I think you're about to see the same thing happen with hair transplants and the reason I think it's so first off the market market size five billion dollars last year projected to reach 30 billion by 2031 so eight years it's going to go from a five billion dollar market to a 30 billion dollar market that's a compound annual growth rate of 20 Euro year over year the people that you are selling to are the most desperate cohort of individuals right like started losing a little hair on the back of my head that sucks like that is a thing that you don't want right so I think and I think you see this already with hymns and the other one I forget Roman or something whatever the name is like they're selling like fear of balding basically and they've been able to create these huge businesses and I think if you're able to do this like if you look at the hair transplant market today it's a bunch of just like kind of like semi-shady plastic surgeons like billboard like like billboard having like billboard yeah exactly those kind of people and like you have to sign like these waivers where it's like you know like 50 pages of like I will not Sue you is what it sounds like and I just think there's a an opportunity to build a better to build to build something like that can you um tell me how so a a thing that before I started Hampton I was really interested in the research business particularly data I screwed this up with Trends man at the hustle we had this business called trends I charged 300 a year it's really dumb and I went like fairly broad we should have just done that before a more narrow Niche and you're one of the few companies I think that's gonna a few Media Company a few media first companies that's gonna pull off having a totally non-related income stream to ads how does their your research business work because I'm I'm what I've noticed is that there's very little Innovation not Innovation but there's very there's very few younger people talking about it because it's not very sexy but if you look at a lot of really large companies for some reason a lot of them are in England but there's like a lot of research businesses that are making hundreds of millions of dollars a year and they've been doing that for 50 years but they're so big and the founders are dead and so like I'll go and like read the biographies but I'm like I don't know even know how you started this damn thing because like it's been lost in 50 years of History how is how does your what's your research business providing the user and how do you operate it how does it work basically in crypto there are these things called protocols like uniswap and Ave and compound and then there's like these layer ones like ethereum you've probably heard of Solana all these other things the industry is moving from treating these protocols like they're these like weird esoteric things to treating them what like what they are which is just businesses so maker Dow for example they'll do 100 million in Revenue this year that is a business they have like people they pay like employees and contractors profits costs that is nobody talks about them like that so what block horse research does is it's a platform for investors who allocate to crypto assets to basically look at uh these crypto protocols and look at their user metrics financials get research on them we're very early to Trends with what's happening with the protocols you can look at the governance so like if you want to look at uh who's voting on different proposals if you want to look at like how people are how people like who are the big stakeholders inside the protocol you can look at all of that inside the platform so it's probably not useful to you it's incredibly useful if you're a crypto fund who Alec who has like two percent of their portfolio in in crypto so and and you're getting and so the way that you built like V1 was did you just go and find like a dozen or something public click or private databases and aggregated all the information into an easier to use way and then do you like write articles on your findings we started with we started with with research so what we started with was we just hired analysts and had them write like what feels like almost sell side research on these protocols and we put it behind a paywall it's super easy we started with 25 bucks I don't know I don't know what South Side research means you're using these words and I don't know what they mean so I'm going to interpret it as disrespect and it is disrespected it's uh it's like these 10 page research report you got a lot to learn my friend I don't know [ __ ] anything dude it's these like 10 page reports on like how is something doing so they'll be what's like the salsa you know so in in finance there's no I don't know anything man you had a family in finance you know this [ __ ] man my dad sold onions for a living I love onions so anyways we have there's there's like deep research basically on these protocols so instead of a news story which might be a couple hundred words there's like a 10 page report like here's how we think the asset's going to do here's how that we think the protocol is going to do here's how the last quarter the user metrics looked compared to this quarter that all went behind a paywall that's how we launched then we did what you're talking about which is we basically just started there's all these inside these protocols they vote publicly on what to do with the protocol and it's called like forums and proposals and that's a total pain in the ass to track that it all happens in like Discord and all the and on these disparate sites we just super manually scraped all that information put it into a database then built a front end for that and put it behind the paywall and now we've automated most of these processes but back then it was just a lot of like very manual uploading and then um two weeks ago we launched our analytics product which is like the data product where you can see the user metrics and the financials for any of these protocols so if you want to look at hey what was ethereum's Revenue yesterday I can tell you that hey what was this ethereum's Revenue compared to Solana's Revenue yesterday I can tell you that user metrics of like this exchange versus this exchange I can tell you all that how much did the first product cost to build uh likes like a million bucks probably so we have we have a team of eight analysts and a couple of Engineers and how big do you think this business could get just the research side I think Politico Pro what were they doing they were doing like 100 million in Revenue weren't they yeah Politico sold for a billion um so the reason yeah so the reason politico's business was nice was they had a huge media business and then about you know 0.01 of Their audience converted into the research platform and that was called Politico Pro so yeah we think I mean we think it can get much bigger than that um we think that there's a lot more ad dollars and a lot more research like subscription money in finance than in politics so like low end of the spectrum you've got Politico they sold for a billion Bloomberg terminal is like the super high end almost like it's like saying you want to build a Google or an apple it's like Bloomberg's one of the best businesses in the history of the world they'll do like nine billion in subscription Revenue um so that's a crazy business but somewhere in between there's like refinitive right nobody knows refinitive there are capital markets information platform they sold for I think 27 billion uh cap IQ right fact Set uh a lot of a lot of like multi-billion dollar companies just built on the back of basically one asset class like Bloomberg was just bonds and then you expand out from there are you taking all your personal money Jason's money from the company and buying crypto right now so Mike and I don't pay ourselves that much so we don't I mean most of my money is just in Block works like if block like it's just yeah I don't I don't like I don't have too much money yet but you're heavy on crypto right person I mean of what you're of of your liquid portfolio of my liquid portfolio I'm until very recently I was 100 in crypto yeah you're insane man I think that's so stupid that is insane you and my wife are you and my wife agree so that's not the case anymore but uh if it was up to me I'd be 100 in crypto really still that's crazy man why I have deep deep deep conviction on this industry yeah more conviction than the energy drink slightly yeah yeah deep deep deep conviction and like I think it's one of the best things to work on for the world uh and I think it's from an allocation perspective like risk reward perspective there's no better industry in the world to work in than crypto right now I was talking to Sean the other day like through text I was like I my my preferred route for personal finance is just like his argument is I was like well do you think that I think the trailing 100 years is going to repeat itself and he and he kind of is like well I I actually don't believe that okay so because I believe it I think like an 80 20 of stocks and bonds is the way to go um but what I think is if you have a private company like blackworks like I used to I think it's reasonable to keep most of your liquid money in a in almost mostly bonds or t bills or some type of like liquid but low rate of return but safe bet and then you have what's it called a barbell strategy and then you have the rest of your money in a high-risk thing being your private company your private company I would say it's not crazy high risk because it's a profitable business with years of operating history but if I'm in your position I'm or my my criticism of of that of that portfolio is you have your liquid money and a high risk bet at the moment and you also have and you also have your private money or your your your your the majority of your net worth and also a a somewhat high high risk uh thing doesn't that freak you out I know I know you're neurotic like I am how do you go to bed at night like thinking like that don't no it doesn't freak me out I don't I I it doesn't freak me out at all and here's one difference you you have money right uh nobody ever got wealthy through diversification no single person ever got wealthy through diet you are wealthy it's just not in cash your blackworks Is wealth it may not be cash money but it is well it is something I get that and then you could make the argument that look if crypto Works block works is a you know billion multi billiard whatever you want to call hundreds whatever you want to say whatever number you want to assign to it so I'm basically already betting big on crypto so yeah put it in put in equities that's the reasonable thing to do I'm I'm not I think you're probably right I just am uh it's you know what it is it's uh it's this cheesy Jeff Bezos regret minimum minimalization thing it's like you know what would kill me Sam if I didn't have any of my personal money in crypto and crypto went the way I think it's gonna go that would that would like kill me to my bones you know what wouldn't really like it would suck but I would be like at least I took a bet is if crypto went down another like 90 percent wouldn't phase me at all I'd be like you know what I took a I took a bet and even though even though I make fun of you I respect that I I think that I I do respect it I think you're in a really good I think you you're no different than the Brett Adcock who we just had on of like who's just like you have an idea you have a vision you have a you think the world's gonna go one way and you're talking you're talking the talk and you're walking the walk and so I I deeply respect that I think the good news is is that you're you're such a wonderful entrepreneur that it's gonna everything's gonna be great uh in the grand scheme um but I always like to push back on people who uh yeah uh are dude he's also just uh like the way the world is going so I probably agree with you about the s p like the s p will most likely just keep doing what it's doing and like I say it's a safe place to go but like does any part of you look at what's happening with the world and say like things might be a little different in the future you ever do you know who Peter turchin is no is it wait is he a does he does he spell his name funny does it actually start with a t it does it does so all right so Peter churchen's this historian and mathematician he developed this field called Clio Dynamics and he kind of studies the you would like him he's a history guy studies like the cycles of cooperation and conflict amongst Elites and societies throughout history and his argument is that periods of internal peace and cooperation are disrupted when the population of Elites grows too large and then competition emerges among them for what is actually these limited Elite positions which then because there's too many Elites and two little positions that leads to infighting in the elites as they try to maintain their wealth and status and it causes social instability and a breakdown in cooperation and it doesn't historically that breakdown cooperation social instability does not stop until there's a crisis like something big right State collapse Revolution whatever it may be and then a new new cycle of cooperation resumes so I don't know if you tend like if you look at history you can cut you can see history through the lens of whatever lens you want to see it there's like the the fourth turning which is like these four big periods and you can explain it like that there's like this Peter Church in Clio Dynamics view but one thing I believe is like crypto is a better way out of this whole system so let me give you my argument against that cool I think it could be true and I don't know anything about this guy but I want to re I want to learn about what he has what he thinks I know I read a lot of history books and that's I do it for fun um not for like trying to find the answer to this question but what I've noticed is that when Empires cease to be number one they don't go to not existing oftentimes they just go to being like number five or number seven for example England so or or let's just like look at I just pulled it up I just look at what the I shares Emerging Markets ETF is for the trailing 30 years it's compounded annual return is something like five or six percent a year so the reason why I'm I'm willing to bet over the next hundred years that the trailing hundred years will repeat itself is because if it doesn't repeat itself it's not it's still not going to be that bad it will go from so actually in the last 15 years I think it's been you know crazy I think it's been like 13 a year I think that if it's not seven or eight percent it might be five or six do you know what I mean yeah I kind of agree with that it's not going to go away it will maybe not be as good but it's not going to go away that's kind of my point that's what I believe in I I agree with that I I agree with that I think I think we're on the same page but I think that you just I think I think it's just far more exciting to read about America ending than it is about the same [ __ ] happening over and over again I don't think America yeah I don't think America is going to end and I don't think that um this is my problem with kind of like the bitcoiners which you're not in like you don't spend time on crypto Twitter so you're and you're a lucky man for that but like the way the best way for Bitcoin to really work is for the US to collapse and that is a really shitty vision for the future and um that's why I like don't align with a lot of like the the bitcoiners I would say bitcoin's a good hedge but like I don't want Bitcoin to go to a million because the world in which Bitcoin goes to a million is the world in which like civil war is back in the US so but but a theory but ethereum and like what is happening in in D5 is a very different vision and that is a vision that like says look these companies that were built in the in the in Amazon Facebook Google and apple they have become far too powerful the traditional way to uh or like what the US thinks is the way to like decrease their powers through regulation I don't personally believe that that's the way to do that and I don't think that will work and I think that the best way to to like build a better future there is through is through crypto so as we wrap up tell me the the books and articles that you've read on this topic who is that guy what was his name Peter turchan okay and what are the other it sounds like you've read about this what else is good fourth turning is good how long is that book dude I I can't do read a thousand pages on this topic what is your current thought on cryptosam just out of pure curiosity here and like seeing something like permissionless with like thousands of people walking around like do you think that is a scam do you think it's just not gonna work do you think are you excited about it but you don't understand it like I'd just be very curious to get your take there I'm not incredibly well versed so I will preface anything by saying that like I'm not I'm not that well versed in it but I would say that the major things in the space like Bitcoin and ethereum I I do I I enjoy the uh I uh like the ideology of it like I I respect that and so I support it I think that ninety percent of the rest of the stuff is a complete scam I think nfts are for the most part total [ __ ] I think web 3 for the most part is total [ __ ] and I think that the people who entered into that space oftentimes are horrible entrepreneurs who are looking for get rich quick schemes and by slapping uh web 3 or an nft onto it rather than building a widget that truly solves a problem that people love that isn't just built to sell to other people in that space so um that's what I believe so I own ethereum and I own Bitcoin and I like to sit on it and I enjoy the idea that it could exist because I I I'm in favor of like the government not controlling certain things I think it will exist for a very long period of time it will potentially become more useful but most everything else in the space I think is nonsense cool interesting cool what do you think what do you think about that I think uh I think you're generally right that there are a lot of like hucksters who come into crypto and that was probably true two years ago anyone who's still in crypto is is not a scam artist um it's two that no one no one operating in a market that's 90 down trying to scam people um but two years ago generally the same and I think like you love history you read all the same history books that I do like you there are a lot of parallels to new Industries right whether it's like all the scammers coming into the oil industry right in like the 1870s like very similar because this is get rich quick money trying into the railroad industry same thing get rich quick money into the car uh into the electricity industry into the car industry like basically 90 of people who came into those Industries they were scammers um and I think that America because we're talking super macros like America is probably the most optimistic country in the world and that leads to frauds and you can't have one without the other so like in places is where they're not optimistic they don't have frauds they also don't have companies that get billed so I think those are like you can't have best part about someone's also the worst part about someone say one in the same I think the worst part about crypto is that the people who were selling [ __ ] social media consultancies or agencies then crypto I agree I agree and now they're in AI now they're in Ai and now they're and now they're in Ai and I think it's that's bad for that industry it's like being a presidential candidate and like the KKK assuming like being like Oh we love you you'd be like no no get the hell out of here you know what I mean that's like what it's like yeah it's like we're like get out of here yeah so I think that's been quite bad uh for the crypto industry in this in the same way yeah it is AI now but that that's kind of my opinion um I agree what's your plug block Works research Yano on Twitter what are you what are you doing yeah yeah and on Twitter um we got blockworksresearch.com I have a podcast we have eight eight crypto podcasts at block work so if you like crypto podcast go to you know we've got a bunch I host one called Empire that's the plug come to our conferences Das London coming up March 2024 going across the pond well I appreciate you coming on that's the pod that's the pod [Music]

you're like the whole milk version of an Elon Musk you know what I mean you're the Midwest version of an Elon Musk but what the hell did you know about building a [ __ ] airplane you know what I mean what did you did you know anything about that no I did not I um knew nothing I was just like I really wanted to do it [Music] [Music] all right everyone we have a really interesting guest his name is Brett Adcock I've talked about him on the Pod a bunch of times but let me explain why this guy's interesting so he started a recruiting website that he sold for a hundred million dollars which in most everyone's case that's a massive home run you're incredibly successful of what she is but then he parlayed that and invested pretty much 100 of his money into another company called Archer which basically makes like unmanned helicopters and then that took went public at like a 1.5 billion valuation and he started another company called figure which is making humanoids they're basically robots that can work warehouses and do uh human labor the reason I wanted Brett to come on is because I just wanted to think and learn about how someone who's so unique how they think and how they make decisions and so Brett's really subtle he's a he's a Loki guy he's not crazy high energy um he's not one of these guys who we have on who is a a personality where they have a big personality on on YouTube or Twitter or anything like that he's subtle man the guy's humble and he's quiet and I find that to be incredibly fascinating my opinion in 10 years Brett is going to be in the running of however we think of like these like Howard Hughes Elon Musk types of crazy folks who build these amazing world-changing things Brett's gonna be that I mean he's already up there but I think he's going to be like that and no one knows who he is now or at least uh compared to some of those other folks so what I want you to do is listen to this episode particularly like the last 15 minutes when we talk about his latest company it's really fascinating and I want you to tweet at me my handle's the sampar p-a-r-r so the the word the and then Sam and then par tweet at me and let me know what you think about this guy and what makes people like him special because I'm really fascinated with these types of personalities and I'm fascinating with how people can learn so much information so quickly it's just really fascinating to me so let me know give it a listen his name's Brett Adcock let's start the show all right dude let's just get right into it the reason you're interesting to me is because you're incredibly successful I imagine you're worth hundreds of millions of dollars but you you go all in on stuff so you told me with this new company figure you financed it for the first year and you put up most all of your money into it I was like I was like what what what's your asset allocation for your personal portfolio and you're like well I own Archer stock which I took public I own a house and then I put some huge amount of money which if you want you could say into the my company figure and I'm going all in on them and I and I just go hard I go all in is that right yeah this has really been out of necessity um my career when I started battery I couldn't get anybody to invest in the business for the first like almost like three years uh so I basically put all my savings into the company took no salary for three or four years how much savings did you have you're 25. I think I had like close to 200 000 I put into the business um and then you know I didn't take any salary for three years I meant like um had to pay for my own health care or food rent I was living in Manhattan it's really expensive and 2015 things got so bad that I had to borrow I think it was fifty thousand dollars to pay for rent and survive I had like credit card debt I was yeah I was probably in the red like negative a hundred thousand dollars prior to the acquisition of energy well what did battery exit for um 110 million so that was a that was a windfall right yeah that was great I raised like a little over 10 million dollars over like seven years so I had a large you know percentage ownership of the company so but yeah overnight success from going from you know seven years of Agony and debt to like having capital for the first time in a significant way and then did you I don't know if you're telling me these stories like when you're if you're goofing around or not but you said that you put most all of your money into Archer right yeah um when I so I started archer in 2018 so I called Arch radiation and uh we build um electric vertical takeoff and Landing aircraft so these are basically aircraft somewhat similar to a helicopter but they're purely electric and they're they're the goal is to use the aircraft to move people around cities so the traffic's just like such a terrible phenomenon nobody's really worked on traffic for 100 years so we were basically out there I was out there trying to solve the traffic problem and kind of help help the sustainability and the pitch coming out of battery was just it was bad like it was um hey we need um basically probably about a billion dollars maybe more to get the market or we or we don't make it we're designing this new type of transportation system in the air so instead of driving to the airport you would fly and it needs to be fully electric that nobody in history had ever certified an electric aircraft before and I was coming off a software you know 10 years 15 years in software so that that pitch did not really resonate too well in 2018. you're like uh we made a joke in the last pod where I'm like if you drink a glass of milk with dinner you're my type of guy like people were making fun of me from being from Midwest you're like you're like the whole milk version of an Elon Musk you know what I mean you're the Midwest version of the of a neon musk but what the hell did you know about I mean software is easy in a sense like you know like it's just code right like No One's Gonna Die if you if you screw it up or in most cases No One's Gonna Die and if I talk to a guy who's doing like Computer Engineering or computer science I'm like what the hell do you know about building a [ __ ] airplane you know what I mean what did you did you know anything about that no I did not I um I knew nothing I was just like I really wanted to do it that doesn't make sense to me yeah what do you do that doesn't make sense to me like if I wanted to go learn about how an airplane is built I guess I would like or or a unmanned drone I don't know what you want to call it I would go I guess I would well first of all you have to have a high IQ to begin with which I don't but I would like what I what would I do I guess I would call people who know what they're talking about and ask them what books do you read and then I would go and read the books and take lessons and maybe I'll go to like a college a few college courses I don't know like it just seems like an impossible thing to learn and you learned it in how many years so yeah so here's what I did I um one is I spent a tremendous amount of time after a veteri figuring out what I wanted to work on next I kind of fell into the recruiting Marketplace space with veteri and I really wanted to be very thoughtful um about what I wanted to work on so I basically spent a large amount of time figuring out okay what is the right opportunity I want to spend my time on and it was Archer it was very clear to me I wanted to do Archer Aviation and build it so the first thing I did is I basically built a spreadsheet and I called everybody in the I could I could think of in the world uh so I think I made um I think that spreadsheet is about 300 people I connected with whether they're at NASA or professors or working in Industry at rotorcraft or airplanes or turbofan development whatever it would look like and I just immerse myself and I want to know every technical book that was on on the market I wanted to understand how to build electric aircraft like what are the components and what are the physics governed by in the space and uh I probably spent almost six months in a room just making phone calls like cold calling everybody in the world what's that call look like hey uh Mr Conway my name's Brett yeah um yeah can you talk to me about helicopters it's it's crazy man like people people will pick up the phone for you like it's just like you just gotta pick up the phone and call and people will talk to you people wanna people wanna help what was the most uh like breathtaking call you had or meaningful call you had I did a I did a meeting so I I in addition to calling everybody in the world the parallel track was I was going back to school so I went back and like learned how to do uh like mechanical and aerospace engineering and you know leading up to that I went to an event in 2018. I think it was 2018 it's like early 2018 at this point it was at this Hyatt like like basically Hyatt Hotel in Atlanta was hosting this like electric um aircraft design course so it was a lot of aerodynamics folks and uh folks in the industry that really wanted to understand the physics around electric aircraft I went down there and I basically sat for two days uh being lectured on how to build an aircraft electric aircraft from scratch how to think about the propulsion aerodynamics uh batteries and um it was it was just like all my heroes today electric Aviation and one of the guys there was in his PhD at the University of Florida and said me too I'm doing my PhD electric Aviation and I want to build an EV tile aircraft and I go to the University of Florida and I said wow I went to I went to undergrad at University of Florida as well he's like you need to come by ASAP and see our lab where I'm trying to build electric aircraft and you know smaller scale and we could help you so I did this course I got on a plane I went down to Gainesville and I met the the head of the group there and um he's basically the the head of all mechanical aerospace engineering University of Florida and he had this like basically 12-person lab building things like hobby grade like electric aircraft drones and I said I want to take this lab over and I want to just build um electric aircraft um and uh this lab happened to be off of Archer Road so I called the business Archer Aviation what percentage of the veteri windfall did you put into this education portion as well as our starting Archer I like all of it yeah all of it but what does that actually mean like how are you living well I was living off the cache so I I had just from from veteri just like paid my bills I took no salary at Archer for two years I don't know something like that like this is a zero um like cover Insurance type thing and um you know I made like I went from like having nothing to like having tens of millions of dollars after tax so it was you know it was a lot of money I just didn't need I didn't need almost any of it so I wanted to work on this new new thing and no nobody would like I couldn't even get meetings at one point I got introduced like a the guy that runs like General Catalyst Joel and um he called my pitch disrespectful what do you say he was like it was like mid it was like right when covet hit and uh I got a big introduction from him uh from like one of my investors Mark Laurie introduced me to Joel he's like this is the best guy you got you got to talk to him and I got to call Joel and he's just like I gotta stop you right here man this is the most disrespectful pitch I've ever seen we have people dying because of covid I think the hospitals are filled up and you're asking me for money like for like for this like flying car idea like what are you talking about it's just not possible like why would you be doing this and I said like I'm running out of money personally like I need somebody to fund us or we're also like you know I know I know covet's bad but the business is gonna die and this is what you do you fund companies like this is why I'm calling you like this is um and yeah I would say probably gonna stay the worst phone call I've ever taken so I sold my company three years ago and I had the same thing where I like I didn't I was I was just barely getting by and then overnight things changed and I was like I'm gonna spend six or twelve months just like seeking planning I'm gonna figure out what because I don't I don't know if you took time off but I took like three months of like kind of normal 20 or 40 hour work weeks and low stress and I was like all right cool that's what I needed I felt recharged I need to get back to it except when I went back to it I was like have you heard of icky guy it's like this like for it's like this Japanese like uh concept where there's like four rings that overlap and one of the Rings is like uh what does the world want to pay for the other ring is what does the world want the other one is what do I enjoy doing and then what am I great at and like ideally you find something right in the middle because if you find something that you're great at that you have skills at but the world doesn't want to pay for it that's just like an expensive hobby if you find something the world wants and they're willing to pay for and you're good at but you hate it that's just like a crappy job so like you want to find something right in the middle so I was like what am I skilled at and basically I I thought of it like I'm just gonna use my skills and what do I enjoy and I'm just gonna try and do something slightly better and I think that's a pretty rational way to go about doing things like most people are uh they're like I don't want to do too hard too outside of my realm what interests me about you is like you're kind of an alien like you like we're like all right this software thing this veteran thing it worked I don't know if it worked as good or as as you wanted it to or not I don't know the full story but you just like took a total 180 and you're like screw the 15 years of Internet experience that I'm doing I'm going to do Aviation Hardware I'm going to do a totally different thing what do you think is is unique about you that makes it so you don't actually want to like go the easy route because I know at veteri I think you like built did you build like the email marketing software like that's pretty like it's a very narrow Niche and you did something not even within it within that Niche not even related to it and you took the totally different route what do you think is inside of you that makes you do that because I find that fascinating I think at the end of the day I just wanna want to wake up it's like a amazing future that's exciting inspiring are you motivated by money not really no um I think if I wanted to make a lot of money I'm probably in the wrong field you know I think like the like there's like a risk reward balance in startups like I think if if it was just about money I think I'd be basically probably back in software still uh I think going and doing these projects I'm working on now or just probably the probably the surest path to losing everything when you're starting figure um like you know you read about Elon Musk and he's like well I put everything in and he's like I was sleeping on couches and it's like well the couch was like Sergey Brin you know it was like his couch which probably isn't like a normal couch you know it's probably the couch in the living room of the guest house and you just don't want to go use the king-sized bed but like when you're starting figure are you ever worried about running out of money and losing everything that you've earned I basically almost went um personally bankrupt last year the figure what yeah tell me that yeah so when I left Archer I had basically you know all my asset all my money tied up into Archer like just had like and you you can't sell that as an officer right yeah so like Insider yeah we were like you know I I made it pretty uh clear when I started the business and even when I went public that like uh me as the like as a founder and CEO I'm not selling stock we're pre-revenue I told the board this I told all of our investors this I even put a million dollars in the in the spec uh pipe as we went public at 10 bucks and so um personally I was like I'll put another million dollars in here a three billion dollar evaluation to show you guys that's all I got and um and when I left I left archer in April of 2022 I had 12-month stock lockup this is public like there's an SEC document for this and so I couldn't I couldn't I couldn't sell a majority of all my stock was fully locked up until April of this year so I had some percentage I could sell over over some time series I could sell a certain amount of stock limited by certain volumes of the market cap so there wasn't just that much volumes a year ago so I was selling some stock to function figure and the stock went from like when I left the stock was at five or six bucks it wouldn't take a dollar eighty end of last year earlier this year and I I was just like I don't know if I can get to I don't know if I can get the 12 month Mark which was uh 12 month Mark was April of 2023. that's like April you know April 18th 2023 Promised Land like I can sell unlimited stock no volume restriction all stock lockup which which I'm you know I have a bunch of stocks though here I'm not selling right now but like um but that was the point where I needed to get to and I thought you know I was underwriting and seeing that stocks at three four five six seven dollars like no problem I'll be able to get there and we were building a team teams that like was that you know 40 or something like that we're building we're spending like millions of Hardware bigger yeah we were like we were within six months we were at seven figure a month burn I figure and I was just like it was like Shell stock transferred to bank account uh transfer it into the company pay payroll it was like how fast can we get that done and it was like a full system of like trying to get the like not hitting the limits every day on stock selling uh getting the cash into the bank account and putting money in the figure and um and I wasn't you know this was like there was a recession we were in the banks were going bankrupt it wasn't like it was a pretty market for series a or categorizing it was the worst Market since we've been in since the financial crisis uh from a from a fundraising perspective I had a stock of stocks going down like 75 percent and I was just like I'm running out of cash so I'm in my same I'm in my Hampton group and I'm like everybody's like what's your you know most most important thing you're doing right now it's you know talk about I'm like I'm running out of money I might not make it what did they say what was their feedback I I think they were I thought I think they thought I was a maniac I think everyone thinks you're a maniac yeah I mean like I've talked to a lot of people who know you that's what fascinates me about you but what fascinates me about you is that your hand you handle stress differently like I I've toured your factory and you were like smiling and like jumping around like you uh like it seems like you're like Jolly almost I don't know you're showing me this [ __ ] I remember going to your factory or your office and you're like check this out we got the knee working and like you see like a knee or ankle I don't know what it was like you see some something of the robot and you and there was like 18 or 10 people just sitting around and it felt like I was hanging out with like buddies in a garage like just watching you guys finally figure out how to work like a remote control car or something like ridiculous and it seemed exciting though like I remember being there and I met like I have to be part of this and it was exciting but I didn't I I know that you go all in on things I didn't realize how close you were to running out of money like I don't understand how you deal with that like what's your wife saying when you're like hey we might file for bankruptcy personally in the next couple months yeah I think it's even worse like we I had a second mortgage on my house to get through it no way what did she say yeah so I also in the category of like you know people thinking I'm a maniac my wife's just she's been with me for 15 years now through all of this like we lived in you know thousand dollar a month apartment in New York we had to downsize two to get through the veteri stuff um to you know to to now Archer and figure um she's great like she's she's a warrior she like Believes In Me and she has total faith in what we're doing and I don't take these things lightly like a really these are like planned exercises I need to go through um and I've been been through many near-death experiences I mean Archer like like what I went through a figure was probably like a tip of the iceberg to what I went through at Archer last like like five years like Archer was just uh you know a go in public was just like a recipe to get sued and we were going public to us the SPAC process we you know as soon as we price the SPAC deal the market turned on spacks it was it was just a roller coaster um so yeah I just I've been through many exercises like this before and I think I can weather them pretty well now I don't know anything about like business finances I remember when we started our company I didn't know the difference between cash flow and revenue which was like a pretty big deal you need to know that I didn't know what that was until like three years into the company and I was like I thought cash flow and revenue were the same thing I don't understand how to read a balance sheet I don't know how to do any of that so I'm I'm um taking classes right now to like figure that out and I was Googling stuff and I found this website it's called streetofwalls.com so I went to Street of walls and there's these amazing articles where you click start training and there's like it looks like a book so if you're on your computer go to streetofwalls.com so there's like introduction there's like what does an investment Bank do there's like how do you do a discounted cash flow analysis there's all this stuff and I scroll to the bottom and I always click the about page uh and there's a link that says file this site and author on Twitter and I clicked the Twitter and it was you you wrote you made this website and I was like texting this is pretty funny I was texting you ahead of time I go hey I know you took a company public I don't know anything about finances how did you learn how to do it and you're like oh I actually taught myself how to do it and then I did most of the preparation work for the IPO and I was like that's amazing and you didn't even tell me you had this site where it was like a whole site of your learning and education what was the site what is streetofwalls.com yeah so I so when I when I went to college I enrolled in uh like industrial and system Engineering also Finance this is like you know not something I also talk about a lot but like I basically did a few years in finance after school before like doing the startup life why don't you talk about that was that embarrassing it just doesn't the pitch doesn't isn't great like I think like people just don't like hearing about Finance folks and I also didn't really enjoy it like I think you know I look at those years of saying man I wish I was like spending more time doing technology development and I was working full-time but building startups and stuff on the side and um I just look at that saying like I think it was helpful in some ways but like probably net net like would have been more important just for me to dive in and start building businesses full time um so I was at you know in school somebody gave me this book it's called like the fast track to like invest in banking management consulting and trading and I read it and it was like you know people are going to finance like Drive Ferraris they just like do so well and they make 150 000 after school and I was like I was dead broke in college like taking out loans to the paper school and I was like man I'm gonna just go this is how I'm gonna you know make some money start my career and I went into like interview with Goldman Sachs and I just I just whiffed like they asked me like um some accretion dilution you know uh like M A modeling and lbo questions or leverage buyout questions and I just I didn't know anything and they're like you know I think the guy was nice he was like listen you just you have to have a certain like bar of understanding of financial finances he's like this is such a disrespectful interview yeah this is the second time you're disrespecting people constantly yeah exactly and um it's like you're like wasting my time and I was like man like um I'm not really learning how to do this stuff in college so I'm just gonna have to go alert it and um you know I was learning that I just started like writing notes and writing about it and um when my brother actually went to finance my brother works at a private Equity company now I was like I'm just gonna repackage all these notes I'm gonna put them online and also give them my brother and um like like when I'm where am I going to use them again and that was the Genesis for a street of walls we've I think I've gotten like 30 million views uh of that site the last like you know 15 years which has been which has been great like a lot of folks have been like this has been my primary reason I've gotten a job and um but you know as you can see I've I haven't spent a nickel on it and over a decade do you how do they get traffic I mean according to similar web it's still getting a hundred thousand or so people a month coming to it it's all organic SEO that's insane I mean that's kind of a lot right I mean for such a high uh for this would be an expensive term to rank for yeah these are like you know there's thousands of pages of content there with good original content and it's you know it's just ranking high on Google you wrote all these I wrote all those articles yeah were you going to turn this into a business yeah I saw at one point I was making like five thousand dollars a month selling those interview guides like like one year out of college it was great I mean it was like a 98 margin business okay well when you're in that position what's stopping you from going full time on that because if I'm broke and I'm 24 and I'm making five grand a month I'm like this is the thing yeah I I didn't I I strongly believe like I I strongly believe I need to touch like the mass market and um to have like significant impact in technology you need to have like a a either a lot of people using your product or very few that use it like really like it a lot and I just felt like the products the services I was starting were just um not important enough for my time so in the Pod we on this pod we talk a lot about like ideas and like different opportunities in terms of Veterinary what opportunities did you see that you guys weren't able to pounce on that still exists one of the things we did is um you know so work so I started the battery at the NYU incubator um and um one of the guys there handed me a book one day and it's like it was it was the predictable Revenue book uh which is basically like an outbound lead generation marketing Playbook he said hey you need to read this so it'd probably be pretty helpful for veteri um and uh those guys it was actually tap Commerce those guys sold for like over 100 million to Twitter uh so it was Brian Dondo there and um I ended up reading the book it's like this is great we need to like replicate the system fully end to end so I started like working on um writing this uh outbound lead generation uh process and we ultimately gave it to um basically a person that's here with me today so Lee randazzio gave it to her and said hey can you you go go figure out how to build this so she brought on an engineer and we basically built this outbound lead generation Software System that basically ended up powering all a battery so that was basically like how do we put uh contact information of people and basically do this Cadence of emails out to folks to do like basically drum up leads and you can do this for both like customers where did you get the emails uh we had we built an offshore team of like 300 people in the Philippines and we did it all by scratch what does that mean going to LinkedIn or something and just build yeah you can um basically finding the right people based on job titles and then there's a process where you can use to find emails pretty well like there's you know uh there's a lot on GitHub there's a lot of you can get the emails through Facebook pretty easily there's a basically a process where you can basically back into somebody's personal email address there's also like databases you can use a lot of folks shoes so we would get emails plug them into this machine and go and we basically built this like huge engine that would power like millions of emails we were doing per month and then um I think it was like an early 2013 2014 there was like the startup emerging um which is Outreach and we demoed it we're like this is the same exact thing we just built internally you know Outreach now is like a four or five billion dollar company and we're like watching Outreach scale up we have a product that this is literally built internally ourselves that we're just using ourselves at the time we thought it was a little bit better so we didn't use outrage that was more customized for what we're doing everything else but uh it was really funny to see us you know me go out and build like a 100 million dollar company when internally we had a four billion dollar company sitting internally uh so there was there was a few of those that happened through the life of battery that were it was just interesting to see and um I think that goes back to my same theme which is like be very thoughtful like so so my my time now is haunted by am I working on the right things do you think that was the wrong thing I I think battery was the right thing for me at the right time but it was definitely not the right thing to do it was definitely the right call to get into Archer next in the figure and um I use it as a learning lesson to say what happened with better is I fell into it I fell into it from Street of walls I fell into it because I built up this huge database of traffic from like from from content and then I use that to help build and bootstrap the marketplace with battery it wasn't as if I like I was in college when I kind of the stuff started and said um I want to go do recruiting this is where I'm going to spend the rest of my life in it just I just fell into it and um happened to work out really well and I think I wouldn't have been able to start Archer if it wasn't for the veterinary acquisition so you know I think I think looking back it was something I would have done again but I used that less I use that as a lesson to say I do have a choice on what to spend my time on and everybody does and it's the most pressed asset you have because we don't have that much time left all right I gotta tell you about one thing that's one of the great joys of my life and I'm not a cars guy I'm not a watch guy but there's one thing that gives me a lot of joy and that is having a virtual assistant uh you know here's the scenario I'm running my companies and even though I'm supposed to be this uh CEO we all know I spend 20 30 of my time just doing random [ __ ] stuff that is not high value but it's just tedious the stuff that has to get done but it's not creativity doesn't require me and it doesn't add a bunch of value to the business it's just stuff just stuff that has to get done and so that stuff is what a virtual assistant does like just this week alone you know I lose my wallet so she goes to the DMV website fills out a bunch of forms it gets me a new license or um you know every morning people have their morning coffee I have my morning metrics and my morning metrics are basically all the business metrics that I care about compiled she goes she finds them for all the different sources puts it in Excel sheet takes a screenshot text it to me so that when I wake up in the morning I don't go on Twitter or check my email I'm looking at what are what are the metrics at and what do I need to do I'm focused on the right things so having a virtual assistant is a no-brainer whether it's travel booking email inbox or just knocking stuff off your personal to-do list that would have just lingered there forever um I think it's a no-brainer if you're a business owner you should definitely do it um I think one of the best ways to find a assistant is Shepard so go to support shepherd.com you know I pay my assistant I think eight dollars an hour something like that that's double what she was making in her previous job so it's a win for her and for me it's super affordable it's something that you know you don't need to have the biggest business ever be the biggest big shot in order to afford it so it's amazing I now do this for my CEO and my cm02 like I just give them assistance without them even asking because I know it makes them more productive that's it does that for me so of course it's gonna do that for them too so go to sportsshopper.com check them out um get an assistant and tell them I sent you they'll take good care of you if you do that so sportsrefer.com check it out I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better what was the math that you saw or like the graph or whatever that made you want to start figure like what was there a signal where you're like oh man this can be the biggest company in the world because I think you saw that to me you go we will either go to screw up and go bankrupt or we'll have a very small exit or it's going to be a 100 billion dollar company or you said something like that where it was like this is either gonna be the biggest thing ever or total failure but what did you see that gave you the idea that this could be the biggest thing so so what what we're doing to here figure is we're building humanoid robots these are robots when we see humanoid I mean it it looks like the human form so it has legs arms hands we're not trying to look like a human but we're trying to do everything a human can do and when you look at the world today if you like go out in the world and look at everything you're doing it requires a human interface in the physical world so the equivalent to I always make an analogy is when you use the internet using a keyboard and mouse and you can interact all the internet you can use a keyboard your little your fingers are like your little little keyboard and mice um you can basically interact with all the digital world the physical world will last several hundred years we built to interact with the human body so we have like door handles we have tools we have stairs everything around us was built for a human interface and so when you look at what we're doing here is we're trying to build an automation solution to do physical labor how do we get into the world and do human-like tasks and when you look at the market for human human-like tasks it's half from GDP so like you know GDP is roughly 70 80 trillion half of that is goes to human labor to pay wages every single year in the world and it's roughly half or so for you know for if you go to any company or any country in the world it's roughly half a GDP and what we've seen now is we've seen this like we seem like these emergent properties happen in in the kind of the space we operate here that are allowing us to build and do this this decade we have Hardware from like um that is that is capable of being built to do human-like tasks and then from a software perspective separately we have software today and we have ai systems today that can basically understand like semantically what's going on in the world and do human-like uh applications from a software perspective so here at figure what's so so at a high level the biggest company the next 10 15 years in the world will be humanoid like AI powered humanoids that like that's for sure going to happen the question is like what groups are going to do that well I think Elon Musk let me find this quote I have this quote here I think he said um Tesla has a robot I think it's called Optimus so Elon says it'll probably cost less than twenty thousand dollars to build and it will be a bigger business than cars so like it's going to be huge um and so you you just looked at that math and you're like I have to go all in on this but what's the business model like you you rent them out to people or you sell them to people what do you do yeah you can do either I mean this there's a there's definitely a similar capex model that is very similar to how we like buy and buy cars today where you would want to you know buy the asset it would have a certain amount of depreciable lives um you'd have to like pay for services and maintenance and then there's another model which is like operating model which is we're calling it robots of service which is a leasing model so you basically be able to put robots into say you know uh warehousing or manufacturing related applications and you would charge basically a monthly fee for that work and that would be a kind of a lower price per year that you would pay but ongoing and um so we you know here at figure we're pushing the robotism service operating model we think it's the way to get costs down to make it affordable to the masses um and but some of the initial conversations we're having with clients too is that they're you know interested in buying them because they've been buying robots for you know a decade so I think we're open to kind of getting out of the world what um we're seeing here is we're seeing the ability to get these robots over time with the high enough volumes cheaper than like a mid-priced car um and then if that robot can last four or five years before it's fully depreciated um the cost should be pretty affordable for the even even for the home we should be able to put robots in the home for you know several hundred dollars per month I was talking to my family members as they're like are you talking to tomorrow I was like man it's the guy Brett he builds a humanoid it's like and they're like what the hell you know what the [ __ ] is that I'm like well it's like you know how like Amazon workers do this stuff it's gonna do that and then like inevitably the answer is like oh so he's gonna put everyone out of work all right that's cool what's your rebuttal to that like how do you think about that like you know you seem very like altruistic and you're like you're like I want to save the world so what do these people what are they gonna do and when are they going to lose their jobs so what we're seeing from like a labor perspective is that the the amount of people in the workforce is starting to shrink so we have like roughly 3.3 billion humans working in uh in the world a big chunk of that is the Baby Boomers and they're retiring out of the market and then from uh you know from the other side we're basically having roughly a little over one um child per household at this point we're well under the replacement rate for humans which needs to be like like about 2.2 uh bursts per household so we're like we're not putting more into the uh uh the top of the funnel we're not putting any more in and the bottom funnel we're retiring now so we're basically shrinking the labor force so when we walk into um I think the conventionalism is what you say it's like you walk into one of these like big big companies and they're like we're worried about you taking our people's jobs like how are we going to message this like what are they going to do that is complete 180 from what we see with boots in the ground if you if you actually do the work of walking into a company that's big and you ask them their number one problem they'll say employee headcount in in retention so we walk into these warehouses manufacturing retail whatever and we walk in and they're telling us that 15 of employees don't show up every day to work they're saying they have two to three percent weekly attrition 50 to 150 annual turnover the working conditions are harsh it's really hot in the Summers it's cold in the winters you have to walk miles per day you have to pick like a lot of items per hour it's a lot easier to drive an Uber in this condition than be in these facilities so when we walk into these clients they they have a labor crisis going on and they need help ASAP and they can't figure out how to automate these more dexterous and human-like tasks and so um you know our goal is to go in there and do like the dirty and hard work that they can't find humans to do today and we think there's just problem I've never seen a business like this where we walk in and they're like we'll buy a million of them if you can do this and so the the demand is like I think it almost unbounded I don't even know how to handicap it it's if you can build the technology we need Millions when we were hanging out I was like why don't you just do a software company and you're like software is harder and I was like what why he goes well because I had to make people like want Veterinary like I had to convince them that this was a good idea and then like I had infinite options on what to build and I had to hope that I was building the right thing and then he said with Hardware I can find problems where there's already demand I know if I could if if I'm able to build this people will want it and I know that there's a set of laws dictated by physics of which create the rules and I just have to figure out within that very small set of rules can I build this and as of now you're like I think I can but I haven't entirely figured it out but it's a much simpler puzzle to figure out in order to like build this thing and if I build it the business is is going to be the biggest thing ever because I know people want that and I remember like when you said that it kind of it changed my perspective on on a lot of things did I say that right yeah I think that's pretty accurate like in software you have a lot of these things that are these emergent properties that happen in like say the marketplace or SAS characteristics that make it really hard to control you have retention and you have competitive threats and you have like feature build there's a lot of things you need to do to kind of keep the the wheels in the car and keep it running and in Hardware um if if there is demand for the product it really puts the focus on the technology development so at Archer we already know people are driving to the airport there's like in LA there are 60 million people driving around every day and six million of them are taking over an hour going like 10 15 miles so like you know you go to like Pasadena to LAX if you could fly that in seven minutes or you want to drive that an hour and a half like what do you want to do for your time we know if you can fly that in seven minutes and it's safe and it's affordable over time a good amount of folks will take that service so it really puts the burden on the technology development of like can you go build something that is safe and affordable and uh like you know and gets good performance like in the reliability side so that was the that's the Archer case a similar figure it's the case of can you get robots that can actually do useful work and this is governed by physics There Are Rules there are equations so like there is no like um I don't need to have to go out and invent a new physics equation or like aerodynamic equation to make that happen I understand how an air foil will will behave in a fluid I understand how battery cells discharge like we we understand all those rules so it really puts the burden on us to like think about like what's really important here and what's really important if I had like beam back the most important thing to myself 20 years ago I would say Brett what really matters or what doesn't matter is like marketing PR who you raise capital from the tech crunch article like none of that is Meaningful it'll make you feel good as a Founder because it's usually extremely shitty for like so many years building companies what really matters is the technology development that you make which means how often you're iterating and then you can measure that by how much progress you're making between those iteration Cycles that's basically the game that we're playing a figure and we played at Archer it feels like you're like playing with connects or something you know what I mean it felt like play when I was at your office I remember people were chilling I think I came on a Friday and people were just sitting around um and I they weren't drinking beer or anything but it was like that same like Vibe of like we're just sitting around like and they like giggled when like the knee moved you know what I mean it felt like you're like it was almost like a glorified Lego set a little bit it felt pretty exciting yeah I think it feels like uh I would say it probably feels like the most Cutting Edge r d lab you could walk into with a focus to move fast and [ __ ] product how big how big is figure going to be in 10 years I think the space is it's the it's the world's largest ham it's I think it's probably most similar to like autonomous vehicles in terms of like the technology development the risk to developing and deploying the technology but I think it's easier to scale we don't have the same safety um hurdles that self-driving car would have to have to drive safely and on on you know on city streets and not Harmony not harm anybody at those speeds and so I think it's I think it's bigger than a self-driving industry and I think it's easier to scale it once it's working um so I think if we can demonstrate our robots in commercial opportunities and we're learning like we're we're in commercial um work doing useful work and we're like training our neural Nets with real world data and getting better recursively getting better I happen to think this this business is probably valued bigger than cruise and waymo which are like these are 30 billion pre-revenue companies and I think we can do those over the next like 24 months we'll have robots in commercial applications with like some of the world's biggest brands in five years you think figures in the in the um 40 50 billion dollar value range I just think like this is a really big industry and we're we're we're so five years from deploying robots into commercial opportunities that are making money it'll be in very low volumes but you'll be able to see the robots doing useful work and you'll be able to see the robots getting better over time I have to think I'd be a really large market cap who knows what what it'll look like um I think it'll be significant to where even where we stand now and then hopefully within 10 15 20 years we're like we're seeing we're seeing robots at scale and Commercial opportunities really help fill that void with the labor force that we talked about earlier I wish I would have invested more I think I invested 25 000 I should have done more yeah it's it's risky stuff so I don't yeah it'd be uh 25 000 makes me feel good I don't want to lose too much of your money so um I wish I would have done more but dude I appreciate you doing this you inspired me I think um I think that like I'm you and I are not the same and I appreciate that people like you exist in the world you are significantly Bolder than I am but I hope that the takeaway for people listening is like that [ __ ] wears off on you so like whenever I hang out with you like I feel I feel bad about myself in a really great way like where I'm like you know it's like when you hang out with like a really fit athlete you're like oh man I thought I was fit I'm nothing I could totally step it up like I can push this thing way harder I can I can I could go way I could push myself way more than I thought I could that's how that's how I feel like when I'm around you you know you are you're a really special person and I'm very thankful that I get to like hear some of your wisdom I think that um one of the things on this pod and in my life we try to find people early and I have a feeling that we are very early in your journey and that you're going to be a very very big deal a bigger deal than you already are in the next five or ten years and I'm very thankful that we're able to like you know we bought your stock early yeah thanks Sam that's the Pod all right now show me the robot [Music]

at the Mr Beast Burger opening Colin and I we spent 24 hours with him before and after the night before there was a question around like how many burgers they could serve and there was already 15 or 20 000 people there the night before right they were sleeping in the Mall mall security was there and I don't think anyone fully understood uh how big he was at that moment and so they were like okay we don't know if we can serve all these people and Jimmy was just like what do you mean what do we need to do and they're like it's just not possible we can't get more supplies here and he was like well can we just pay someone to do it and so he's like I'm gonna pay everyone an extra thousand dollars today and there's 30 people working it was 30 000 a lot of people would look at that and be like that's kind of irrational to spend an additional thirty thousand dollars but you know he looks at that and he was like this is what I need to make this excellent right we're just gonna do that what ended up happening was it was possible and Jimmy just kept pushing

then he said this line that he left he goes that sounds silly I understand that that my whole day is just about posting on Twitter but everybody's just got a thing that's my thing okay and he's like we've all got one thing that's my thing I love it [Music] all right we have a special episode we're gonna talk about cool content that we've consumed this might be short 20 25 minutes but you want to kick things off yeah well I want to say why I think this is a good type of episode to do we um yeah one of the best ways to change your life is to change like your if you don't change your body you'll go change your diet uh or your habits your workout habits or your eating habits uh if you want to change your mind you need to change your info diet and so one of the questions I like asking and I know you do too which is like you're like it's like the dorkiest question ever we probably should find a better way to phrase it no it's a great question but it's the answer is so good that we don't even care how lame the question sounds but I've heard you say this before like so what media are you consuming so what are you like what are you reading nowadays or like what content do you like to consume which is I do that in job interviews and people will be like oh I read like The New York Times I'm like no come on like what subreddits are you like consuming do you use Reddit what about Twitter on Instagram who do you follow what where are you getting who who's influencing you that's yeah Palmer lucky this we were like what reddits what subreddits do you go on because his brain was it was like he's firing off all these awesome things in all these different areas it's like that doesn't just happen by accident that happens because he's got a set of interesting inputs that leads to a set of interesting outputs we as MFM want to be one of those interesting inputs for you so that you become a more interesting smart uh you know person based off of listening to this but we're just one thing so what we want to share is what are the best of the inputs that we read listened to or watched this week then maybe you should go check out so that's the premise of this um I wish more people did this of people that I find interesting I wish they would be more um I wish they would curate for me like yo here's the one or two best things I read or watched this week or listened to just to get my mind going and show me cool things I should go go do anyways that's the Spiel I want you to kick it off um I want you to do the top two uh all three years are good so once you kick it off with the top one so one of the best things I watched this week is Bill gurley's talk at all in have you heard his his talk that he did at the all-in conference yeah so he did a talk I believe it was about Uber and Regulation and like some of the surprising things they found so Bill Gurley was the like lead investor in Uber um and he goes to all in and I expected him to talk about I don't know Venture Capital uh business investing but he's now retired he's a retired VC so he's like kind of in the No Flex given mode which is great like you know when you get a really smart person who now feels like they have nothing to lose they can go off and I feel like that's the best way to describe this it wasn't a talk Bill Gurley went off and so what he does is the talk is titled I think it's like 2851 or something like that some number and he he's basically the talk is like that's the number of miles between Silicon Valley and Washington DC and what he does is he talks about regulation and how screwed up it makes business and so he goes through example after example and it it to me it felt almost like a John Oliver you know when John Oliver does those Last Week Tonight things where he just has a monologue he's like exposing something that screwed up or like coffeezilla does this on YouTube or he'll go in and be like Logan Paul scam people and let me just expose the whole the grift he exposed the grift of Regulation and he's like dude look at this like covid happens so they pass these laws about covid testing and look at this this same test in the UK or Germany cost like you know seven times less as it did in the U.S why because in the U.S it was mandated that only these two companies tests were going to be allowed and in Germany it was a free market so the test the cost went way down or he would give an example of um he's like you know here's the guy who passed this law uh and he says that these are the only three vendors that the government can use and so they charge this crazy amount and then guess what here's this LinkedIn oh what do you know five years later he's on the board as the chief whatever at that same company that he handed this prize to and it's like the grift is real and the thing I loved about this because you're like Dan that was a great talk he's like I've been working on this for like 15 years he's like basically for the last 15 years every time I saw something that was just a complete grift I was screw it's just a effed up part of the system I wrote it down I made a note and so he's like this talk is basically 15 years in the making of me kind of uh observing what screwed up about the way that Washington works at the end his mic drop is basically like he's like I called this talk in a 2008 or 51 that's the number of miles between San Francisco and DC and when I talked to people in DC and they ask you know how does Silicon Valley you know do so much Innovation it's because we're so [ __ ] far away from Washington DC like we're just away from the poison of the way that that place works and we're the farthest possible place away on the map in the United States from from DC so I love that talk was there any like promising parts of it or like this is gonna change or is it like this is well at the end they're like what do we do about this can this change it's like well the first thing is this we have to like expose this right like you know you gotta shine light on it you know the bacteria sort of grows in the dark and um the second thing was he was like you know uh it's hard because the incentive is the people who could change the laws that would say Hey you know maybe if you write the laws about these companies you can't trade their stocks for example right like we said this on the Pod yeah but the people who need to pass that law they're the ones who are profiting from this so he's like it's almost impossible to change that incentive like it's like they would have to do that they need so much pressure in order to make those changes because uh they're not incentivized to do it in fact the opposite their entire incentive is to keep the system the way it is there's this interesting thing that's going on where I don't know anything about the government I don't remember if it's the Senate Congress whatever it is but uh it was like one of the few things that both a handful of like hard right Republicans and hard left uh Democrats were agreeing on where they're like all right we're going to create like a political Index Fund where you could only have if you're a politician you have to you can you can have money but it must be in this particular index fund and so like you can't own individual stocks you know how Nancy Pelosi is accused of like doing whatever and then how I think the head of was it the New York Stock Exchange there's uh what are the companies uh like like two weeks before the government shut down with kovid they sold a bunch of stocks and like this all looks suspicious and so they're they're trying to like argue that there needs to be a political Index Fund it seems like a pretty cool idea actually by the way there's a startup called autopilot I don't know if you've ever heard of them they do like uh like it's like a automated money management or like you know basically it's a way to what you can do is you put your money in the app and then you could be like oh I want to copy the Michael burry portfolio and you can just copy their public portfolio yeah it's cool what they did that was really so the business is doing okay and then it's like growth took off and I was like dude what happened like incredible chart he's like we made this Twitter handle called the Pelosi tracker and they have the burger the policy tracker and whatever and the Pelosi dragger has 339 000 followers and it basically every time she makes a trade they um they post about it and so they just dig through the filings and they it's hilarious things and and her gains that she has and like of course somehow Nancy Pelosi's like happens to be you know she you know she's uh you know happens to be up 30 year to date like she's outperforming Warren Buffett she's outperforming your favorite hedge fund guy like it's insane how does this government I think you know official do this it's like well maybe they know some things before some things happen it's insane um um it's corrupt that was a genius growth hack that they did um all right I'll give you one so this has been going around Twitter but I went and watched the whole thing uh it's pretty amazing so Dion Sanders I'm not I'm not a football guy you're gonna know I'm not a sports guy you're gonna know a lot more about this than I am Deion Sanders he's now the coach of what is it Colorado yeah the Buffaloes the Buffaloes and he um he was on 60 Minutes I think like two weeks ago and it was pretty amazing they did like a 12 minute segment on him and it was really fascinating because I remember Deion Sanders as being like this like cocky like Showboat guy and he is still a little bit of that but he's incredibly insightful and so basically uh what's any what university was that it was a historical black college it was it Jackson State where he was yeah I forgot the name of it yeah some not very popular school he gets into coaching he he does a decent job there then he gets recruited to go to Colorado which is a big deal but what he does is he um he's doing two interesting things the first interesting thing that he's doing is one of his sons is filming the whole thing it's like his garyvee thing and so his son is like filming behind the scenes and posting it on YouTube and driving uh interests it's really fascinating what he's doing have you seen that it's amazing so one of his sons is the quarterback the starting quarterback I think another son is on the team too the other side is like you know what the cornerback or the yeah I think he's a cornerback which is what Dion used to play and then uh the other stuff the the son that's not playing football is basically the garyvee Vlog guy and he's just in the locker room he's documenting the whole thing and sharing it on social as they go and they're just doing a better job of it than like you know anybody's doing following that stuff yeah it's awesome and the second things that he did was his leadership skills are really good and they're kind of shocking because I just thought that he was just like a meathead and he was just this really cocky guy nah man the guy's really insightful and so basically they show uh like a clip from one of his first meetings with the team and he basically he goes I'm here to encourage most of you to quit the reason being is you guys are the team's lost so much I think last year you were like one in 11 so you lost most every game you barely won a game and the coaching staff they're all out we got rid of them I'm here I brought a bunch of my guys here who I know are good and look here's the deal uh the coaching staff is to blame but you know who else is to blame the kids because the coaching staff probably recruited a bunch of losers and I'm here to get you losers to quit and he and and the the guy on CNN was like hey man that's a little harsh like these are kids he goes well look if you are willing to quit the team because I said that you're probably weak and you're not an asset to this company and if you're gonna let words scare you I need you out of here and I need the tough guys to stay and I need you to be an asset and not a liability and he re-ramped the roster he brought like 40 play 40 new players in which is half of a ball team roster and and 50 left and 50 left they went into the transfer porter portal and he goes uh he he's like look truth is good for the kids this is what I'm here to teach you football I'm going to teach you how to how to live life and be a good man and what you guys need is truth I need to tell you the truth and I need to prepare you for the real world and we're gonna I want a winning team and he does this other thing where he goes uh the the interviewer goes so who do you think is the best football uh football coach right now in the NCAA he goes well do you have a mirror that I could hold up so I can see him he's like it's me he goes I'm gonna be the best coach but then he does a good job of being like humble he's like well I learned a lot from Nick Saban he's forgot more about football than I'll ever know and so I'm looking for a little Crumbs from him but it was really inspirational because I think that uh this type of like uh pound your chest leadership the way that he delivered it was really good it was very inspiring on how to lead a business yeah you know I'm usually not uh believe it or not that big of a believer in uh like the effect of the pregame or halftime speech like that seems to be like probably overrated uh in terms of what a coach can do and vastly underrated is the systems and uh like habits and standards that you like enforce and instill um and so what people are seeing a lot because it's super viral you share the halftime speech you share the the the pre-game speech or the post game speech and they're and Dion I don't know if you know between football and uh this uh between playing football and this he like became like a pastor like part-time and so he was like very religious and he was like given sermons I remember watching him on TV giving him sermons in a big white suit um but if you but if you watch one of the other things he does he set a bunch of Standards so he's like you know day one and almost in the uh like that book The Score takes care of itself by uh Bill Walsh where it's like okay yeah we want to win but the score will take care of itself if we do these inputs he said like the famous stories like he makes the people answer the phone in the front desk appropriately yeah and John Wooden did the same thing he's like we're gonna learn how to lace up your shoes if you can't if you don't take the time intention to figure out how to lace up your shoes just to make a point of like what we do out there is a result of how of what we put in let's let's understand that it is a direct result of what we put in and so we're gonna we're gonna monitor that and so uh one of the things that that they show in Dion stuff and I saw this when I was at Duke with Coach K it's like it's the little things that they said as the standard so for example he's like you know if you are on the field he said put up he put up footage from the previous practice he's like look at what's Happening Here can anyone tell me what's wrong and it's like I don't know it's not even a play what are you talking about like it's nothing this is just us walking in between the drills like he's like exactly you're walking if we were on this field we run we do not walk and he's like basically created a new set of standards and so he's like if you're in a team meeting where do you sit how do you show up do you use your phone do you do and he's just like kind of like instilling these standards so while the speeches are getting a lot of the the the the the shine I think the more interesting thing is basically in the how we show up uh the daily standards of the inputs uh that go into it and now of course you know they're undefeated right now and they're doing really well and I think it's more because of that yeah it's awesome and he the he did a good job where he was like when the guy was like when he did the whole thing like let me hold up the mirror and he was like well look here's the deal I tell my kids I go I expect you to be the best so I'm gonna be the best too and he's like you're I think you can win the Heisman Trophy and I think I'm gonna be the best coach and so he does a really good job of balancing this like cocky we're gonna take over the world and also uh high expectations so I thought that was really inspiring what do you got all right I'll do another one um this is in the nerdy realm so there's a guy who is a Twitter account I really like called CFO Secrets I love this guy he has a newsletter that um I didn't subscribe to but I just saw one of his posts that was really great it was uh it was called uncovering The Mystery of working capital and M A I was like okay that sounds like you know boring has a market size of like three people right now it's just like dude when we when I sold the HubSpot it took me a week to under for them to explain what working capital was and I still don't understand it read this post it's really good so one of the things that I look for is like you know you can tell when somebody actually knows their [ __ ] and off honestly like sometimes when I go on Twitter or I go on YouTube I just want to delete my account because I'm like it's so annoying that the most vocal people just don't know what the hell they're talking about um and there and what happens is some people know what they're talking about they produce content everybody loves it but then some people instead of taking that content and going and executing on it they're like I too will create content about how to be successful although I am not successful yet and then they do it and then there's like a ladder below that and they're like I will tell people how to do sales even though I've never done sales even though I don't know anything about sales even though I've only sold ten thousand dollars in my life right like and it just ladders down in that way and then and those people have the most time on their hands so they're the most like active uh publishing stuff it's crazy so seeing this guy's newsletter I was like oh finally somebody who knows what they're talking about so he has this thing about M A and if you ever sold a company so much of what he says Rings true he's like so he he's like the post starts like this I'm just going to read you some of the best parts of it goes it always starts the same we're tired they're tired um everyone's been sprinting get this over the line and we're sprinting because time kills deals and he's like if you've done deals you know this momentum is what oils the deal wheels and he's like there's always a point where the deal is mostly agreed we've agreed on the headline valuation number and that took a lot of negotiating it's tired us out and now there's only two or three points left to agree in the deal he's like most of these are boring stuff like reps and warranties and the legal documents and we want to leave that to learn there's maybe one Commercial Point left and so the other side picks up the phone and they say hey we just uh we just need to iron out this one detail about working capital Peg and he goes I'll say something like oh thanks for the ride I've been so busy on the on the documents I haven't had much time to give that thought I'll get back to you tonight but I've thought about it I've been thinking about it I've been thinking about the working capital this whole time I'm just setting up my position that way that oh I haven't really brought it you know I haven't even put much thought into it and then I'm going to bring them a very well thought through thing that I think is uh gonna make sense and he goes there's one last trade left in the negotiation in my experience this is one to three percent of your total Enterprise Value is just this last thing and it's a pure win lose negotiation between both sides you're tired they're tired who's gonna feel like ah screw it let's just get the deal done and I'm like and you know we just went through a negotiation so you know this and then by the way that's what I learned from you about negotiating you're you had a line that actually changed me which was the the person who can be comfortable with the most amount of uncomfortableness will will win exactly yeah the short version of that I say in every negotiation is the more stubborn party wins always uh people think that the person who wins a negotiation is the one who has the stronger logical case hell no it's the person who's more stubborn who wins always and um how do you be stubborn you need to be comfortable in the UN in the discomfort and I would say honestly when we did this negotiation which maybe we should do by saying by the way a breakdown on the whole thing one of the one of the things I think we did not do a good job of was this last bit the last point which is that last you know one to five percent of value and we were just so tight we just wanted to get the deal done I don't think we did a good job like four months yeah and I think that the real way to do that is that's when you need to like dig in the most because it's that last deal point that like you can get and you'll thank yourself later for it even though in the moment you're feeling tired it's like any workouts like do I push here or do I just say I'm tired and I stop and like anybody who knows about workouts is like no push through yes you're tired but you'll feel So Satisfied and all the gains will come on that those last two reps of pushing it um so anyways he talks about this and then he gets into the nerdy part where he's like all right here's a spreadsheet like you know you have your Enterprise Value and then you have your Equity your value your actual valuation what's the difference between the two it's like well your Enterprise Value includes the debt and the capital that's in the business and then your valuation you know your the actual Equity value is what's left after that so I think just a very useful doc a very useful newsletter for people who are going to go through that or going through that probably Overkill to read this early but if you're going to do uh m a it really really pays to have somebody who's good at M A on your side um when we were doing our negotiation I was basically trying to convince you hey let's have our buddy who's done more M A than both of us like help us think this through at the beginning you you did good you led that one and you did really good and I would say I'm still like intermediate maybe I'm at the early stage of intermediate there's people who are way more advanced and so uh anyways this is a newsletter it's a very nerdy find for m a I'm gonna read this I I went through this I went through a deal that involved networking capital I still don't entirely know what it means um it was this was very challenging and the guys this guy's writing is really good and he actually sets it up perfectly where like networking Capital was thrown in at the last minute and I'm like oh I don't I don't even know what that is I'm dead I I want to get this done it's supposed to close in eight days I just want to get this done yeah worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM operator is the best the best HubSpot grow better [Music] hey guys really quick so you may know this but my beginning in business was being a copywriter I'm a self-talk copywriter and what that means is I figured out what motivated people and then I figured out how to use the written word to get them to do what I want them to do so that could mean selling them a product that could mean writing a speech or even giving a speech and giving someone to buy into a particular movement it could be recruiting hell you could do it for dating it just basically means figuring out what motivates someone and how to use the written word to take an action get them to take an action or to think a certain way and the way that I learned how to copyright was I did this thing called copywork and copywork is this famous technique that's not really popular anymore but it used to be really really popular and you basically take writing that is great writing that you love and you write it out by hand and you copy it and you make notes of what particular thing that that writer is doing that makes it special this is the exact same way that you learn how to play the piano when you want to learn how to play the piano you learn how to play Happy Birthday and then you learn how to play like Jingle Bells and then maybe like a rock and roll song and then maybe like a hip-hop song and eventually you can combine that all together after a few years and you learn how to make music that you're your own same thing with writing that's how I learned how to write I locked myself in a room for six months and I just did this for many hours a day I created a program to make it easy so you could do that it's called copy that copy that.com you can go there and you can check it out to 10 day exercise to make it really easy to learn how to write if you want you can just go do this on your own you can find great writing and just literally copy it by hand I know it sounds crazy but it works really effectively but I made something that makes it a little bit easier so check it out copythat.com and we will talk soon and back to the Pod you want to go to to the last one oh yeah okay so do you know this account cultural tutor on Twitter awesome follow awesome follow-ups so the story is kind of crazy I didn't really know about it but he he went on David perrell's podcast which I think you you were going on too or something I just uh I just recorded an episode with them last week so David Pro cool guy lives in I think Austin and he's uh teaches people like about writing online he's got a new podcast so he did an episode and the set itself is beautiful it looks like they're in like you know the Royal Library in the UK or something beautiful set so he has this guy on I've never heard of this guy and then I was like oh I did see one of his threads go super viral he did a thread about like why all architecture designs all look the same now they're all minimalist and that thing got like 100 million likes or some [ __ ] like that it was really good it was really weird and it's not even about like a thing you would think goes viral but it hit a nerve and so this guy he does his interview and I've only honestly I've only listened to the first 10 minutes of this so like many books I recommend I got a lot of value out of the first 10 minutes and I was sort of satisfied but he said something at the beginning so he's like this guy was basically working at McDonald's literally he was like flipping burgers and doing french fries and he's like um they had like a mutual friend this guy Harry dry who's cool and uh then David I think David like basically sponsored him he became like his Patron he's like you want to write what if I just paid you to write so he quits his job at McDonald's he just decides okay I'm gonna write every day and David like funds him for whatever reason I don't know exactly how this [ __ ] worked but like I'm sure they explained it in the other 50 minutes of the podcast but the important part is not that the important part is this guy then decides okay I'm gonna write one amazing Twitter thread a day and he says this line that's great he's like um he's like and then David's like what's your schedule he's like he's like yeah I wake up at like 4 P.M and then I just start thinking about my thread and I smoke cigarettes I go for walks I write I go for another walk smoke some more cigarettes and then I you know I'll eat some food if somewhere in the middle there and then I'll just write and then I publish and then I pass out and I do it again the next day he's like that's crazy he's like yeah um I don't he's like you know I'm not the guy who's gonna tell you my morning routine don't follow me but like this is what I do and he's like I just my whole day is about publishing one amazing Twitter then he said this line that I love he goes that sounds silly I understand that that my whole day is just about posting on Twitter but everybody's just got a thing that's my thing okay and he's like we've all got one thing that's my thing I was like I love it and he's like what are the results have been so far he's got 1.3 million Twitter followers he's got an insane Twitter following like he's built a ma in like a year is it making money I don't know I don't think he makes any money off it yet but you can right like you know it's not that hard to turn attention into money once you have attention um you know it's harder to turn money into attention than it is attention into money to be honest he has 1.5 and he has a hundred thousand person email list yeah he's doing fantastic that's that's incredible right so he's doing doing very very well for himself uh you know but I just love the intensity this guy was gonna bring to something and I've actually noticed this as a common trait which is if you bring a level of seriousness to something that everybody else considers not serious you can actually win much bigger than most people realize that's how we felt about newsletters I was like well I'm doing the math I think this could be a legit thing and we sold early but we definitely the business could make 100 million dollars a year you know morning Brew is close to that and I always say one of the reasons why is people thought this was silly but if you did the math I'm like I don't know I think the math is out there I think this is going to be a real thing um and I think that's the same thing with my latest business as well which is we're just taking something seriously that most used as a hobby yeah I don't know if that's true is that true aren't there like you know does YPO not take this seriously do those guys not take it seriously they do but most uh there's a there's a few that do but many many others in the space they think that it's just like uh it's like a small thing that you charge 100 a year for or something like that um there's a lot of there's a lot of hobbyists the better frame I think for what you're doing to be honest is just the is that we joke about it but it is the beautifully done like I am trying to do that your [ __ ] is just more stylish and more cool and more desirable for a variety of intangible factors ranging from design to people feeling fomo to content to um you know the the the the first hundred members that you added to your thing um like I remember getting sales calls to join whatever what a vistage or whatever the hell they missed the mark they missed the mark well what I I love guys like cultural tutor because what I do for a lot of my Brands is I follow people like him and I look at like what was cool in the 60s and 70s that I can just reuse today so for example our color for Hampton it's uh the color of this really cool Jaguar car that was popular in the 70s right and then when I made The Branding I found old Rolex ads because I'm like what was cool then that could still be cool now there's another example have you seen the sunscreen company that's doing that uh vacation where it like it looks like an 80s or early 90s like a guy who did vacation this guy Jeremy Summers he he's amazing The Branding for us for milk Road oh he didn't really character but he helped us develop the whole brand and then the last bit was he we didn't love the character and then we had a different guy do the drawing the illustration for it but he did our branding yeah that for milk grow Jeremy did an amazing job and he's that's specifically his aesthetic um is that kind of like I don't know if I I shouldn't say that he's really good at that aesthetic which is the like kind of vintage classy like you know nostalgic um beautifully done uh sort of aesthetic by the way I'll we'll wrap up with a quick story about David Pro I went to his apartment so basically he lives in uh Austin he has an apartment in the building but then he also rented this other apartment and when you walk in it feels almost like an Airbnb or maybe like you're walking into like a Restoration Hardware Store everything is perfectly set up and David is really OCD and so like he's got this two bedroom or it was a three-bedroom apartment they knocked down one wall so they went all in on this thing and then one room is like the studio where we sit and then another room is like the guest room where if you're a guest and you want to fly in you could stay there but like there's like a record on the wall or there's books on the shelf and I'm like David all these have a meeting he goes he's of course you know me you know every single here every single thing here has a purpose and has a story and so he like perfectly like picked everything in this studio and what is that oh would you like to see this cream-colored book that's on my bookshelf does it even have pages in it maybe this one says what does it say Tango lessons um Tango lessons did I read this book no did I go on Etsy because somebody said go buy cream colored books to put in your background makes you look classy dude everything at David's place is on purpose and it all has a story and I sent you a video and I'm like we have to step it up this guy is so particular it's it's he's the Deion Sanders uh in my world of podcasting right now he did an outrageous comp all of his standards were perfect and like I saw his trailer oh my God the guy's sweating the details David's awesome he does a great job he's gotten way further with a topic that I think is incredibly boring like he makes millions of dollars a year doing right of passage like getting people to become like [ __ ] novelists or something I don't know how he does that that's not even a thing I think people want to do uh like you know write long essays like um I'm a like to me that is these are 10 out of 10 execution on a 4 out of 10 opportunity um you know like if he was doing like whatever used card sales he'd be the he'd be like a trillionaire right because it's like dude he's obsessed with it though he loves it of course of course he's doing it for the right reasons he's so obsessed for it I think he said this publicly I met him two years ago and he's he's a he's Jewish he uh ethnically I I I don't know religiously I don't know if he was as well but he went to a Bible study class every day or once a week and I was like why are you doing this Bible study class he's like well the Bible's really important because it's just like part of culture yeah he's like I'm just so fascinated with like writing and like I've noticed there's a lot of Bible references so he started going those Bible class well I see him again after about a year and he's like I've converted to Christianity they got me like like I just read it so much and I thought you know I really want to go one step further and I want to become a Christian and say what the Stig is all about like he is an academic in like a very at like in the coolest way possible but he's like I wanted bought into this whole thing hardcore I was trying to flirt with him instead of sending nudes I just sent him a font and uh he was over the moon about it loved it it's like oh that is that jaran that made me weak at the knees let's recap him real quick so we got the bill Gurley talk that's a Youtube video um the David Pearl interview with cultural tutor watched the first 10 minutes it's great and uh what was yours yours was the Deion Sanders on 16 minutes Deion Sanders 60 minutes and then the secret CFO newsletter about nerdy M A stuff there's like a series it's like a 19 part series and I read two of them and they're very good all right that's the pod [Music]

it's wild how many bad Educators there are out there for sure and how did you become an expert through years of self-education but also educating myself through experts and I feel I'm very good at extrapolating out and determining what is valuable information and then assimilating it into my own Consolidated Frameworks I've been researching like a maniac 10 plus years at this point I don't necessarily claim to be an expert oftentimes people will label me as such but you know I'm just a guy who's a nerd and learns a lot of and it's been good to date but a lot of the stuff is available though too it's just hard to translate into layman's terms

there's like stories where she's raising funding and uh a guy leans over the table and was like so why should I trust you to be the CEO of this company and she leans back over she goes because I'm a complete and total animal and the guy leans back and he's like all right I'm in [Music] okay what's up we are here and I got two little special announcements for you first one we got merch the boys got merch we're a little late to the game we're a little slow uh most people start selling merch as soon as they get a following took us four years but Sam we figured it out you got to sell t-shirts on the internet and hoodies but that's I think that's all we have uh well we'll add We'll add more stuff but we have a few stuff it's pretty stupid that neither of us are wearing it today mine's in the in the dryer at the moment again slow and stupid yeah but yeah it's pretty cool we have stuff that has some of our uh favorite sayings and uh dude there's no small boy stuff shockingly caught on caught on in a big way I'll tell you something I don't know if you listen but I did an episode with Samir from Colin and Samir and they basically are like they're YouTubers that study other YouTubers so they're like always studying creators and he handed me two things when he came to the interview he handed me a newspaper did I tell you about this no he handed me a newspaper that was they made their own newspaper Edition like one one edition special edition for their like they hit some Milestone so they printed them newspaper and it was like all of the like kind of content or interviews from their show were like it's like here's the here's the monthly magazine or whatever here's the thing for for our stuff dude let's do that that's a great idea that's a great idea it looked like a normal thing but they they made it using their content and I was like I love this he gave me one he's like this is the last one we have I don't know if that's true or not but man you know how to make a boy feel special when you say that uh the second thing he handed me this hat that was a dope hat that says uh press published it's like this blue hat they have this super high quality and I was like oh this is like much higher quality than normal merch and he goes oh yeah yeah here's how I think about merch he goes if you're Logan Paul or you're Mr Beast you make consumables think Prime energy drink it's a consumable I'm selling this to you you're gonna drink it use it whatever and he goes uh Mr Beast chocolate he's gonna or even Mr Beast merch just t-shirts these are all just consumables and he goes we don't make consumables we make Collectibles he goes if you're a Creator you should pick one of the two paths and I love this Collectibles idea he's like because what you want is you want a way look you don't need to make a you're not gonna make a fortune you don't need to make a fortune through your merch and which is why we've never done merch because it's like I don't know do we really care about making a couple thousand bucks on t-shirt sales never been that never been a motivated for us um because we're rich if you missed that part all right so the but the reason is oh my God what a should we play it uh like is that the our new collectible like douchebags R Us going to a store near you um but the Collectibles thing made total sense to me where he's like you want the people who are like kind of your your thousand most but most like kind of devoted people people who actually give a [ __ ] about what you do they're all about what you're all about they think the way you think they act the way you act they're very similar to you they're like for them this is like collectible badge of honor so make a limited edition number of units um and when it's gone it's gone it never comes back and on top of that you um it's a signal so that anytime anybody else sees them with that they know oh they know you're part of the tribe they know you're part of the tribe like if I meet somebody uh Ben said this to me the other day he goes he goes oh you know what I like because he what he'll do often is he'll talk to people who come through my DMs or email us or whatever he loves to go meet them and talk to them and I'm like um that's great you get a lot of energy from that I'm more introverted don't like doing that as much um but he goes no it's he goes the reason I like it he's like normally I don't like just talking to strangers but he's like if you like MFM there's like a 95 chance we're gonna be friends he said because it's filters in people who think the way we think and act the way we act and like you got a sense of humor and it's like you're not gonna like this content if you don't if you're not a business total business junkie and nerd you don't like to nerd if you like don't like to nerd about business you're not gonna like this podcast and if you like everything buttoned up and serious you're also not gonna like this podcast and so it's a great filter it's sort of like when I see another grown man drinking a glass of whole milk for dinner you know what I mean like at dinner like oh hey we probably have similar values cheers good good Catholic what's up uh so yeah I feel that if you got a favorite flavor of Skittle Sam Sam knows you're this guy what's the second thing you have so um okay that's the first prize second surprise is Eclipse channel so this one actually we should have done a long time ago um if you go to clipmfm.com so this is our new clips Channel which is basically you we do these podcasts about an hour each clip of MFM does is it's a YouTube channel for only the clips of the best bits from the Pod clipped out for you so that you can watch them in sort of like three four minute bursts and for every episode we're only pulling out the one to three moments that actually mattered so where somebody told a great story had an amazing idea or shared something about the the way their business works are broke something down in a level of satisfying detail and um at first I wanted to Outsource this and then I was like no [ __ ] that I'm gonna hand curate these clips myself because I'm like I want the Channel that I would want to watch because this is how I consume a lot of podcasts like if you're like oh do you like Lex Friedman yeah like it love the pod great pod I never actually watched the full ones what do you search to find it if you just go to clipmfm.com that'll take you there or the you're gonna search my first million clips and uh I tweeted it out it's got like 700 subscribers now but I need this to get into the tens of thousands of subscribers because if you listen to this podcast You're Gonna Want to like why would you not want to just get the best stuff faster uh or like in a more simple way um so yeah anyways that's my that's my sales pitch for both the merch and the uh the merches Collectibles limited number of units and it's uh it's just a way for our tribe to kind of signal to each other hey this is what you know I'm in the I'm in the club and um on the other side we have the clips Channel how did I do with my sales pitch that was a great pitch and the skittlething joke was very funny and you made me feel very guilty because my why listen listen my wife has her birthday is this Sunday and I was gonna surprise her with a pinata hopefully she doesn't listen to this episode and I have a closet here in this studio room that is where I've hidden the pinata and I've also hidden tons of bags of candy that I went and bought from Party City lots of Skittles on unfortunately I've got to go back to Party City today because I've eaten all the bags Skittles so you nailed that one it's all they're all empty there's a there's a a a whole bunch of empty Skittle bags it looks like a raccoon I went through that bag that's not even like a small hole you why did you need a face-sized hole in that bag because when I do nighttime eating I go into bear mode and I'm like I'm like a bear getting like a like a like a beehive you know I'm just like I'm just like imagine just like using your fists instead of your fingers that's like what I am at Night My sister says this thing to her girls like she wanted them to like just go to their room and take put themselves to bed so she invented something called nighttime sister playtime so that they would feel excited about it's like oh do you guys want to do nighttime sister playtime and they're like oh my God yeah night time sister playtime so they go to their room by themselves they play and they fall asleep and so I created nighttime Daddy play time which is just when my kids are gone and I get to just eat and be on the internet and that's nighttime Daddy play time and I celebrate it every single night dude I like am like putting my fist in a in a jar of peanut butter at night like I'd wake up and there's like bear claws all over the place so listen I want to bring up a topic you put it on your list and it's so funny you put it on your list don't say what it is yet but you put it on your list and I did a ton of research on this topic and it's incredibly fascinating so I want to tell you about this all right we got to give credit there's a reason we both have it on our list someone tweeted at it they did they go you should do it they just said you should break down this particular company and I was like that's one of the very few times where I go that's a great idea sir that's a good one we're gonna do that so let me tell you how it got started it's super fascinating so there's this guy named Steven Brill you have no idea who he is but I bet you know Court TV he started Court TV one of my all-time favorites you know predecessor of cops my favorite show of all time and uh it turns into a huge success and then he also starts American lawyer media which is like a six or eight hundred million dollar lawyer media company that he sells so his next company it's called verify identity pass it started in 03 after 9 11. and you want to come up with an interesting way to make getting onto a plane easier and safer he comes up with this thing where it's like a credit card and you could swipe it uh and in order to like prove that you're I guess not a terrorist something like that and it gets you know a little bit of traction he raises a hundred million dollars to start this business he gets uh 200 000 people to sign up it flops doesn't work out so uh there's this woman her name's Karen I forget Karen's last name actually but she's got this uh hedge fund very successful hedge fund what are you laughing at her name is anyone named Karen I just always think damn uh what a what a sideswipe they got in life by uh by this this trend that just started into whatever 2022 and all of a sudden their name was never the same again she spells it c-a-r-y-n which somehow makes it better to be honest I would too yes like you know pronunciation change yeah like how I call the uh La Quinta hotels Laquita uh it's just a slight Rebrand um so anyway she has this hedge fund it's successful and all but she hears about this company going out of business and she's like you know this is actually interesting and I think they made a mistake they didn't brand it correctly I think this should be more of a luxury good company and so she buys the business out of bankruptcy for six million dollars then she goes on and raises 50 million dollars and she renames the company and she calls it clear clear is that thing that a lot of you folks see at the airport they are at around 53 airports I think it's kind of confusing at first when you see it because you're like oh there's two lines there's a TSA line there's a clear line what the hell is going on turns out this company is crazy successful and it actually has a lot more implications than I ever imagined so clear does something like 600 million dollars a year in Revenue market cap of three billion dollars and what they do is they built this technology at that stand where it looks at your eye and it uses Biometrics so it looks at your eye to uh figure out who you are it looks at your finger print and they like Fast Track you in that line but have you ever wondered how they like get these contracts at these airports it's like a monopoly yeah I don't know how they do it so they give away 10 to 13 of their revenue uh to the airports and what that comes out to be is something like of their uh Revenue in 2019 they're doing like 350 million Revenue they gave out 35 million dollars to airports the most popular airport was LAX that made them around 25 million dollars in subscriptions of which they gave 3 million back to LAX and so they're kind of like in bed with the government a little bit and they have all these people and they're board who are uh uh they took funding from Delta and they have Delta Employees on their board so like the head of Delta they have like the former head of TSA security on their board and it's crazy fascinating because what they're doing now wait but tip I was doing bad listening because I was looking it up while you were talking how did they get into how what like what was the thing that got them in because it's like seems like once you're into the airport and you're the you're the one of course this is an amazing business but what did they do today because in what did she what was the miracle that they pulled off there they promised airports that they would give them a percentage of the revenue so they would open up a new Revenue stream and also what they did was they took funding from a couple Airlines and they on their board they added like former head of TSA and things like that and so like some old-fashioned Gentleman's Agreement yeah yeah so it's pretty fascinating what they did but what's even crazier hey Karen's actually pretty amazing there's like stories where she's raising funding and uh a guy leans over the table and was like so why should I trust you to be the CEO of this company and she leans back over she goes because I'm a complete and total animal and the guy leans back and he's like all right I'm in and so they're but they're killing it now they have 17 million users but here's where it gets really interesting what they're doing and I went and read a bunch of their like annual reports it's super fascinating and also scary what they're doing is you can now sign in to LinkedIn using clear so you can create an account verifying your identity you can also go to certain stadiums and buy beer using just your your eyes and so her whole theory is like look we're gonna start with the airport but eventually you're not going to use a wallet anymore you might use Apple pay for some stuff but for something that involves your identity you don't need to pull out your license anymore we're just gonna look at your eyes and it's super fascinating what these guys have pulled off and I didn't realize guys I kind of thought it was like a douchey company because I'm like uh this is fifty dollars for TSA for five years this other thing is like 150 bucks for one year why do I need this thing but people still buy it I think I was with you one time and you bought it you even know what it was right well we were late we were about to me and you were about to miss a flight to Miami and so I was like all right MacGyver this line how do we do this okay let me just sign up for Clear real quick and see if we can jump the line and it it worked you had TSA I didn't have it and so uh I cleared my way in and we we got on the plane it totally worked and so it saves you just a little bit of time but like what's crazy is that uh their vision is huge and it actually is like a super interesting Vision that they have on how this business can be can be much bigger than it is now and it just like goes way more in depth than I ever thought yeah I'm not sure I'm a Believer in the rest of that Vision because like I don't care uh like the amount of effort it would take for the you're at a ball game and you want to buy a beer and now each beer vendor is going to buy Hardware to uh scan my retinas and I have to stand still for seven seconds while it scans my eyes just to verify my age like it feels like that's not the right payoff like the airport one makes sense because it's like hey look airport security it's a big deal okay you can skip this line and if you're a business traveler you're gonna miss a flight those are high stakes that's important and so it seems like the right payoff to kind of like work ratio I wonder where else that really exists where you actually need to on the spot verify your identity so last summer um a new law was enacted and so right now if you live in I believe it's Virginia and you go to pornhub.com or a bunch of other porn sites yeah go for it uh I see you typing interesting interesting website this one so there's a new law enacted that for people in Virginia you have to verify your identity in order to go to certain on websites to prove that you're over 18. and so it like brings up like a camera where it wants to take your picture from your computer lens to like check your identity shame you it just starts shame with your headphones it's like Game of Thrones yeah like the Avatar is like a it's like a nun holding a rosary and uh she's like are you sure um but uh but like there's like a few instances where this actually is interesting by the way those porn companies uh some of the thing that they're doing is they're putting it on they're they're making it so if even if you're outside of Virginia some porn websites are still making you register in order to like make you pissed off at the Virginia congressman who approve this so you like they should put it all down which is hey Mark Ingram in Virginia is forcing you to open your eyes and get scanned before you watch porn if you feel any kind of way about that push this button well they even have like a Gmail login for some of these porn it's just it's weird it's weird is what it is uh but like I uh it's crazy but there are a few instances but the most crazy thing about clear is like this is a total Monopoly uh that they have in airports and I'm shocked that they've had this I don't know anything about public valuations it seems potentially like an undervalued company what is it valued at and what was the revenue again it's in the five or six hundred million dollar range they claim they have 90 retention so it's not like as good retention as software but it looks like uh their market cap as of today is three billion dollars I mean that's kind of an amazing like a three billion dollar company that does such a simple thing and you said they're only in like 63 airports or something like that that's that's crazy that it's so so big with such a small footprint and it's such a simple product uh very impressive yeah they're in uh 53 airports in uh their their the trailing 12 months they've done 530 million dollars in Revenue wow that's impressive uh here's a random related uh startup did you ever see this company called evolve they uh they make metal detectors no so their big thing was they're like uh it's one of these businesses like one of the meta takeaways of this podcast is all the businesses are hidden in plain sight they're right in front of you and if you just start once you start paying attention you're like oh this didn't just get here who put this metal detector here there's a company that does this how do they work um is this the same company at all of these places how did they get that contract and so metal detectors are at every big venue right um you know stadiums concert for whether it's for concerts or Sports airports that sort of thing and so there's a company that had raised money from Lux uh Lux Capital like a VC firm that does like whatever slightly hard tech or hard tech um and what these guys did was they were made of metal detector good pitch for them they do I don't know whatever well I was gonna say like Cutting Edge hard tech and then I was talking about [Laughter] slightly hard stuff yeah harder than e-commerce so they um but their actual demo is pretty cool so what they're doing is it's a metal detector that can let you just walk straight through much faster so like you don't need to I think it's like you don't need to like um take you don't need to take out everything for your pockets and you don't need to um like you know like I guess like it could just detect it faster so the flow of traffic is faster than a traditional metal detector um and that's kind of just crazy to me that that's like such a simple idea that I'm like oh yeah I guess like I guess that's true like if somebody just made a better metal detector going forward they're going to win a bunch of contracts all right I got to tell you about one thing that's one of the great joys of my life and I'm not a cars guy I'm not a watch guy but there's one thing that gives me a lot of joy and that is having a virtual assistant uh you know here's the scenario I'm running my companies and even though I'm supposed to be this uh CEO we all know I spend 20 30 of my time just doing random [ __ ] stuff that is not high value but it's just tedious the stuff that has to get done but it's not creativity doesn't require me and it doesn't add a bunch of value to the business it's just stuff just stuff that has to get done and so that stuff is what a virtual assistant does like just this week alone you know I lose my wallet so she goes to the DMV website fills out a bunch of forms gets me a new license or um you know every morning people have their morning coffee I have my morning metrics and my morning metrics are basically all the business metrics that I care about compiled she goes she finds them for all the different sources puts it in Excel sheet takes a screenshot text it to me so that when I wake up in the morning I don't go on Twitter or check my email I'm looking at what are what are the metrics at and what do I need to do I'm focused on the right things so having a virtual assistant is a no-brainer whether it's travel booking email inbox or just knocking stuff off your personal to-do list that would have just lingered there forever um I think it's a no-brainer if you're a business owner you should definitely do it um I think one of the best places to find a assistant is Shepard so go to support shepherd.com you know I pay my assistant I think eight dollars an hour something like that that's double what she was making in her previous job so it's a win for her and for me it's super affordable it's something that you know you don't need to have the biggest business ever be the biggest big shot in order to afford it so it's amazing I now do this for my CEO and my cm02 like I just give them assistance without them even asking because I know it makes them more productive that's it does that for me so of course it's going to do that for them too so go to sportsshopper.com check them out um get an assistant and tell them I sent you they'll take good care of you if you do that so supportshopper.com check it out I have this thing called qriket I want to tell you about they spelled this funny do you know what this is by the way have you have you ever have you ever heard of a Cricut Machine no so it's c r i c u t no what is that okay yeah uh Ari new producer Ari is here by the way first episode so if you uh if you like how this produce this episode's going if you like how it's edited credit to Ari if you hate this episode blame on Ari alright so all right have you ever heard of this machine the qriket machine I have not okay this is It's a DIY like home crafting machine it's 20 years old this company makes a billion dollars a year in Revenue 100 million dollars of free cash flow a year Sam how does that sound I like the sound of that and what it is is it's basically a cutter so you put in some material it could be plastic could be a sticker like paper and then it'll cut the shape for you so you can do like die Cuts Like sticker or whatever by the way I barely understand how this works so I'm gonna put you yeah I'm I'm looking at it now it looks like a printer but I guess it's like a printer but it's more for cutting than from printing yes so it's basically a way to cut different shapes of things so you want to put something on a water bottle you want to make a label you can cut it using your Cricut home Home Credit is this an invention that they made or was this a style and is this like a Kleenex tissue type of thing no it's more like um when Steve Jobs like I want you know every uh Bill Gates or whoever was like you know every home was gonna have a personal computer it's like you know a computer on every desk and that's basically what these guys did so there was like these machines were there before for for you know for people for industrial application and then this the company that started it was called like Provo Craft or something like that they were making these machines for craft shops so you would take your design to a craft shop and you'd say hey I'd like you guys to cut this for me this way and they would have the machine on the on the countertop to cut it for you because you're not gonna have your own machine these are expensive what these guys did was they made it smaller and made it more affordable so that people could just have these at home and um and so you know if you go look at Etsy you go look at things like this a lot of those people know all about the qriket machine because they have them at home and they use it to make their goods so how do they cut your name out in this cool looking font they don't do it by hand they have a qriket machine that will cut it for you and so just an incredible business and um I saw I heard about this because we were looking at an investment so we're looking at investment from some of the original guys who were early there and they've spun off and they're doing like a new a new like better version of the qriket machine and I'm like yeah I just don't know how big this space can be he's like well I think it's gonna be bigger than Cricket which does a billion dollars a year and is spinning off 100 million free cash flow and you know as a public company and I was like oh okay yeah yeah so uh my bad and he's he was telling me some pretty incredible things about The Crafting community so he's like you know stores like Michael's um they he goes Michael's if you go read their kind of like uh you talk to their leadership or read their earnings or whatever he's like Michael's believes that every single person who walks through their door is an Etsy seller their default assumption is that if you come to a Michael's you are going to sell on Etsy and because it's like more the majority than the minority which is kind of amazing and Etsy is this obviously this Marketplace to go sell your goods but if you look okay if that's how you sell your goods well then how do you make them underneath that and so I am very tempted to invest in this uh space because it is such a big space what's the product too um I don't want to give it up uh just because it's that kind of proprietary but it's like something like Cricket something like Cricket but better it does more things so the qriket just cuts this does other things in addition to cut got it so um now this came by the way through our buddy Al Doan so if you go back and listen to the episode with Big aldone Al and his mom start a company in the quilting space um and the little breadcrumb trailers we have Patrick Campbell on the podcast Patrick Campbell runs a payments company called profitwell and we were like hey you see the payments of like lots of companies like any cool Trends in the payment space that we wouldn't have thought of he's like quilting and we're like what he's like quilting is enormous it's like cool thing like the grandma hobby is it yes enormous there are companies that do blah blah blah so he told us about that afterwards I get a DM from aldone he's like hey I'm one of those companies that we make hundreds in 100 million plus a year and my mom you know Jenny Jenny Doan or whatever started this business and I joined her and like yeah we sell like kind of crafts for Quilters like little squares right it's like the packages the squares the fabrics and they do like a daily flash deal it's like oh here's the quilting thing of the day and like that's how they do it so they built this huge thing to the point where he now bought a small town and he turned it into like the mecca of quilting it's a Disneyland for quilting the Disneyland for Quilters it's like if you're a quilter and you want to take a trip to like indulge in your hobby this is where you go and I'm like wow this guy's thinking big I love this guy he's a funny guy and so he was talking about quilting and then he introduced us to this deal he's like yeah I'm investing in this thing because I'm in this Craft Space and I you know this is like one of the best kind of Concepts we could do here so I'm just getting I'm just scratching the surface on like this space I know nothing about but I'm very fascinated by this I wanted to share that with you dude the Etsy platform is wild have you looked into like how big some of these sellers are my mother-in-law started an Etsy store and she's making hundreds of thousands of dollars uh selling pillows on Etsy right and one of the cool things about Etsy is you can go to the store and it'll show you how many lifetime sales how many transactions have happened at that store it's visible on every profile yeah and you'll like look up something very obscure and you'll see that they've sold 50 000 versions of whatever their whatever they have it's wild how powerful Etsy is by the way I believe this is how Moy started made of deodorant so I think the like public stories like my sister got pregnant and I was concerned for her health and I wanted her to have aluminum and paraben-free deodorant I interviewed him about this the real story is what basically he was just looking I think he was like maybe I'll do mattresses a lot of people are buying mattresses this is right when Casper was getting going and he called that so he's like yeah mattresses and then he's like [ __ ] these are heavy this is hard to ship I don't know if there's like a lot of repeat buying on this and then he randomly came across a lady selling uh chemical free deodorant on Etsy he ordered that and then he ordered like five or ten other ones and he asked everyone in the office like put this under your arms how's this feel and it like some of it was good and he's like some of it was was bad but he found one that was great and he goes hey lady can I uh slap a native label on this and we just resell your stuff and that's how it starts and then eventually he gets big and gets traction he's like all right now we're gonna make our own thank you very much and I think I think she helped him like formulate it and and she couldn't keep up with the demand she was like dude I don't I'm not trying to scale this to this level like I'm you know my fingers hurt sir like you know can I can I take a break here and um she was like how about this how about I buy the formula he's like how about I buy the formula off you and you help me figure this out then we'll we'll bring this to a manufacturer because we've outgrown your scale now like yeah and then and then after two years he sells the business for 100 million dollars in cash and he that was like you know I think the business probably does like 200 million a year in sales so you could argue it was early but I think he turned out all right but he like sold the business like right before maybe two years three years before like the whole DDC thing was like all right this is more challenging than we thought but but one of the insights was this is I think it I think natural deodorant was one of the top selling products on Etsy and that's why he he had Market validation that there's something here aluminum free deodorant I think this is not like him and many other people do this where like you know the business has this this um you know touching origin story this is this wonderful backstory but like these are often you know reverse engineered later um you know the that's not how a lot of these businesses work one of my fun things is like let's just be honest not this podcast and like say what it is uh you know like I started it like started the milk road because I was interested in crypto I saw what you did with the hustle and I was like oh I get it I could do that and I just did that with uh with milk hustle for crypto and it just like went down that road and did it and my goal was to make a business I made a bunch of money right like that's the that's the thing and I thought oh cool doing this I'll learn about a bunch about crypto that's my TR that's the transparent story there wasn't like some some origin story where you know my cousin needed and then it hit me and then it hit me I should just write this email for my cousin you know and and I didn't stop there I decided you know let's just open up for friends you're all my cousins yeah exactly yeah and so like I think you could do that again on Etsy I think you could always go back to Etsy and look for top selling products and use that as inspiration for uh for thinking you know for boys I'm sure I don't know this but like I'll put a guess out there which is that like an arranged marriage he had a checklist he's like what is under one pound for shipping what is a recurring purchase that's consumable what is something that has a you know uh differentiation against a big Market but has a unique differentiator like natural deodorant that's chemical free versus what Old Spice and these other guys were doing and like he had a checklist and he's like oh good deodorant lightweight you know um review purchase with a clear differentiator got it by the way these qriket machines are awesome I'm I think I might get one of these uh these are sick they're expensive they're like a grand promo code Sean craft at checkout for uh you know 10 cents off these are awesome it does a good find I mean it's not like it was like some like a rare thing but it's rare to us I guess but it is a good find yeah this is out of our bubble um for sure I invested at this company that does this for um for bathrooms and so they they make women's like hygiene products they're like tampons pads that go in um that go into uh like the vending machine it's installed on the wall and so uh it's just like a better uh a better version of um of what used to be there there's always something there and it was just like kind of looked like something a janitor designed and then they just made like a really beautiful version of one that was easier to use more friendly just look cleaner like looks more hygienic and then what happened is that every state started enacting laws saying that hey yeah every woman's restroom needs to carry these products just like you you know you have toilet paper whatever you need to carry these products and so state by state this is rolling out and what they're doing is they're going state by state into um uh into these uh stadiums or schools universities and they're getting these multi you know multi-million dollar contracts for installing their thing and once they're installed they're not going to take them out it's sort of like clear it's like these little monopolies that you can you can get if you're the right product in the right place at the right time with the right sales pitch because once it's installed I don't think they're ever going to go uninstall these things and change vendors because somebody has a slightly nicer design is that company working uh yeah like I mean I haven't seen I can't share their like numbers right away um it's like those disgusting baby changing stations what are those called kangaroo or Jack or something yeah yeah exactly those are filthy yeah uh her name's Claire coder she's very like uh she's a very strong uh like leader kind of personality type person and so she she does a great job like she's on LinkedIn she's like super active with it um it's called the company by the way is called Aunt Flow and so uh has like a more more uh you know friendly name versus like what was there before and what she described kind of like what the process was before versus after um you're like oh I get it and I get why other people haven't attacked this space because if you know most of the VC funding is going towards men a lot of uh Founders who are trying to start these Venture skill companies are men they're not even aware of this issue never even been in the bathroom they can't you wouldn't even know that this problem exists uh but she's done an amazing job of like identifying the problem and then building a like super uh like uh just a likable brand and a likable story where it's like if you could choose between the default alternative or this like you'd obviously pick this that's cool I got pitched on a bunch of those I passed on all of them because I don't know but like that that sounds good that it's working hopefully it makes up money I mean getting those I when I saw I was like I don't know man selling like two dollar things in the bathroom it can that be a big thing but you said they're getting million dollar contracts who pays for it the facility the facility has to has to do that like the facility needs to stock uh this product and it's a recurring thing right they install the dispenser for let's just call it like 500 so it's 500 to install the dispenser and then you're every you know every month or every quarter you're gonna like have to do refills and again that thing's gonna sit on the wall forever uh it's not gonna go anywhere and so to me this is like owning a piece of real estate in all these that's gonna pay you rent and I think that that's just like I don't know if this becomes like a 10 billion dollar company you know that that's like different Next Level stuff but it's clear that this is a defensible business clear that it's going to have recurring Revenue it's clear that um well there's a lot of facilities out there and they're all going to have women's restrooms multiple of them per building and each one of those is going to need to have this in it so you start to add up pretty quick foreign [Music] have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better okay so let me tell this story you know actually these guys much better than I do I only know it's secondhand but I'm a fan of this so back in the day when you were doing the hustle one of the very first things before I knew you one of the very first things you created was this infographic about a business that I found fascinating and it was a business called I cracked and I think what you were doing was you were trying to sell uh tickets to your conference he was a speaker and yeah and you're a genius you were like okay instead of saying come to my conference buy tickets you said look at this incredible story of I cracked these guys were in their you know whatever college dorm room uh AJ and Tony and they realized that smartphones are taken off and so they decide hey everyone else is building apps let's just try to fix people's cracked phones because there's the more cell phones there are there's more crack phones there's gonna be and they made this like on-demand service so if you crack your phone same day they know that's a big problem for most people same day they'll come to you grab your phone and fix your phone and it had this crazy NPS score and it starts scaling they get to like I think in the first um you know they only raise 500k and they get to seven and a half million in uh revenue and you write this you make this great infographic and I'm like this one's in the infographic hating infographics were like the thing back then were they you were the only one I saw it do with them but they were great you and uh what's his name John I think he was their design he was the design guy you guys did an amazing job it's just you two doing the hustle um and so and then you what you did was you're like love the story want to hear more stories like this in fact want to hear AJ tell this story himself he's speaking in the house of Khan in three weeks buy your ticket and then you know I didn't one I'm not just gonna buy a ticket but you would release one every what like week or so uh yeah one a week one a week and by the third week I was like damn I love these stories I don't all right I'll go to this conference like sounds like it sounds like these are great stories and so I went to hustlecon when I met you and you know this story uh you know happy has a happy ending so these guys okay so let me finish their story now because they're what they're doing is pretty interesting so they go they what they realize is okay we people are gonna have crack phones we need to scale and they scaled through colleges so they're like they looked at this business like uh itech I guess which is like you know sort of like a Geek Squad type thing and they were like all right um basically we just need to copy paste what we're doing to like uh actually I don't know if I take was the company They're copying or that's what they called their people but like they looked at like how to scale this they figured it on one college campus it's like okay we need these Runners we're going to be able to cover this radius and repair these phones this way and then just copy pasted it across college campuses and they basically they they taught college kids how to repair phones and icrack would send them the leads and they're like all right you got to go show up at this guy's house you're gonna charge them 300 it's all done the phone you get 100 we get 200 whatever it was something like that it's a sort of scale they blitzed and in 30 days they were on 28 college campuses which is amazing they had booted up 28 campuses in 30 days which I love uh they get into YC they're one of the only non-technical teams to even get into YC and it's because this hustle was like obviously very appealing and um and so at one point they even buy like uh 200 smart cars that they like wrap in their eye cracked logo and they give to their eye techs and they're so they're all running around San Francisco fixing iPhones and [ __ ] it was pretty cool and then I was like okay so how did you scale from there they go well we started using SEO and press and they're like we realized that the Press loves to talk about the following headline 24 year old making millions doing relatable thing and it's like he's like started out of his college college dorm room and they're just doing something that all of us need repairing your cracked phone and these 24 year olds say they're making millions and so they just took that story and they did it at the local level so these Cincinnati uh you know the Cincinnati uh this guy grew up in Cincinnati he's making millions other guy grew up in wherever he's making millions whatever College they went to they did it locally there um and oh they just booted up at this college campus and they did it locally then they did it nationally and they started stack so that when you searched fixed cracked iPhone they could show up organically at the top through SEO from these high Authority Publications that were writing puff pieces about them love it so these guys are great now here comes the problem they're they've only raised 500k they're at 7.5 million it's profitable business is growing fast they never announced this but they go and they raise 50 million dollars to scale the business and that 50 million gets them to go International and at Peak they get to 36 million in run rate but it's just getting harder and harder to keep the group to keep up with the growth monster and the growth monster is demanding that they get to 100 million in Revenue because you raised 50 million that means you got to go huge you've you've cut off your options and so they just couldn't do it and they just could not scale the business beyond that and they end up selling it to Allstate yeah insurance company and so they that one of the guys he stays there for three years he earns out uh his deal and he decides all right after year three I'm gonna quit start my next company and that takes us to Cloud poker night I used it for Hampton or what'd you do yeah well we tested it I was a beta user and it didn't quite work out when we start when you would be a beta user I am beta they called the right guy we need a baiter yeah it was a little rough when we first started because it was only a few weeks in but I think now he like nailed it and it was actually really fun so I want to do two things I want to show the home page because I love what they wrote as the landing page the copy on this homepage have you been to it it's so good read it read it off so it says poker is the new sport for business Minds golf is yesterday's news request access and then there's a photo it's a cute dealer dealing to uh that's Anthony's wife that's the Founder's wife doing okay great by the way cute dealer um so so and then there's like whatever people playing and you can get a demo of the product so super strong Landing uh landing page then you scroll down it says business Minds who love poker so just think about the positioning so almost everybody would be like online poker night right cloud-based poker for you know poker software right like this is like the generic shitty way to Market this but instead they not only say the benefit of it they go even bigger they just say big picture golf is the old way poker's the new sport for business people that's the um that's the we don't sell Saddles we don't sell Saddles here here uh Mantra like when Stuart Butterfield created slack he wrote this great memo if you've never read it go read it it's called we don't sell Saddles here and he's like look guys we made slack we know it's awesome now our job is to teach the world that this is awesome here's the problem most people you talk to that run a company are not in the business for chat software they're not looking for a team chat tool it's just not a thing they even do they're not even looking for it so even if we say we're the best team chat software doesn't matter they don't care they're not into it he's like Lululemon made you want to do yoga to live the yoga lifestyle and he's like we need to do the same thing we need to we need to sell instead of selling Saddles and saying we make the best Saddles we need to sell the joy of horseback riding and then when they once they fall in love with the idea of horseback riding they're gonna say where do I get a saddle and we're gonna say we provide yeah we sell the best Saddles and so same thing here I love what he's doing by saying poker is the new sport for business people um that's the that's the selling the dream and then okay how are we gonna go play poker use our software and they all they they have all these like quotes about uh you know successful people who have played poker and I I recognize a few of these people there's Warren Buffett there's Sam Altman there's Paul Graham Peter Thiel and look at that there's the chairman of the milk road is out there uh that's you're on there and I have no idea I'm on the page two of the carousel if he swipes I never got that far but what they did was they go business mind's love poker then it's a quote and it says which leader said this Warren Buffett chamoth or Paul Graham and you're like oh that sounds like chamoth uh nope it was Paul Graham okay cool and then it shows you another one so again uh using sort of the the people you already trust to say that poker they're not saying Cloud poker night is great but they're saying poker is the best is the sport for business people um and then it's why poker's so great blah blah blah and then it says why you should use our software which I love so I think this landing page is amazing but you have to explain how it works so basically well I mean I've used it so what it is is you uh we're gonna use it for Hampton and we're still going to but we did it for a team night and the way it works is it's almost like Zoom meets poker so they have like a professional setup and in my case when I use it it was Anthony the founder he's got this like home setup that's a that's a card table and then there's a camera on him and you see him dealing the cards and you see him talking to you and interacting with you and you could see all your other teammates also playing but he puts the cards over another camera of which only you your you know the user you see your own card so it's really like live poker uh and there's even a dealer who's like shooting [ __ ] with you and like asking if you want to hit it it's really fun it's very interactive it's awesome I think it's a great business idea uh for a bootstrap business I love this idea um yeah I love poker I played poker I I really I think there's a cool idea I would love to do an MFM version of this so like that's a great idea I mean hold on I think they did make one for us so I asked the guy this morning I go hey this would be amazing I don't like the live shows we did were cool because we got to meet people who listen to the pod that's awesome but I don't like traveling like leaving my house and so this is great because we get to play poker we get to be on camera meet other people who are um listeners to the show and we can just host our own tournament and so I think he's gonna do uh cloudpokernight.com MFM so that there will be a uh uh something there he says to to uh RSVP for this so if anyone wants to play in a poker night we should do that with people who listen to the Pod I think they'll do that'd be kind of Amazing by the way the other founder so you talked about Anthony Anthony Martin he's one of the co-founders of icracked the other co-founder AJ he's one of my great friends he's a crazy person he's one of the wildest people I've hung out with his other company or his new company that he started it's a they call it uh like one headline called it the Tesla for chicken coops so if you go to coop.farm it's a smart Chicken Coop and he like he's into like beekeeping and he's always had chickens and animals and [ __ ] like that so he made a smart Chicken Coop that like opens the doors automatically and feeds the chickens automatically it's pretty funny um I almost invested in it but I'll explain one of the reasons that made me nervous is that like the day or a few weeks or something like that before the round closed when the Ukraine thing happened AJ went to Poland for like a month and was a volunteer helping like Ukrainian refugees and uh the guy's crazy is he Ukrainian no he just is into that [ __ ] he just does wild [ __ ] all the time like I'll be hanging out with him and he's like he used to boat to work yeah he he lived right near uh Oracle and the office his icracked office was in Redwood City but it was across this little Bay and he would take this little boat to where work but every once in a while they had offices in Soma and he would ride his this is like a small boat literally fit two people he would ride this little boat 20 miles up the bay to Soma and Doc is both there uh the guy is crazy you would do crazy no and when I say boat I remember you told me that like a decade ago and I still remember you were like yeah my friend he's kayaking to work by the way the boat's not the best word uh it's better to describe it as a jet ski that you stand up on so like he would jet ski to work basically no that's what this thing was so was he paddling or it was a motor no it had a motor it had a motor and he would like a motor it was like a jet ski he was like he was like Kenny Powers he would like jet ski to work uh his the AJ is crazy he's uh he's a crazy person this raised a bunch of money from Peter Thiel yes yeah they raise money for Peter teal he's like Peter I see you're crazy and I raise you [Laughter] Peter chicken coop it's a weird business but I think it could work yeah that's amazing um so I think this is a really cool business I want to see uh how this goes I actually want to invest in this I wish I could own a piece of this and uh just host poker nice because one of the great things about businesses like this is um the virality so I'm very interested in products that can grow virally and most people get this wrong products that grow virally are not products that succeed through Word of Mouth like if you talk to a normal person oh yeah it's spread virally people used to go tell their friends because they loved it so much no no that's called Word of Mouth viral is literally like the word sounds it's like a virus you you're not even trying to get it on other people but it gets on them they catch it from you so like the classic example of this was Hotmail um at the end of every email it was signed like you know sent through hotmails you know sent with love through Hotmail or something like that so you weren't trying to tell somebody hey you should start a Hotmail account but it was added to every email as almost like you know a little virus that was attached to the email that basically said sent through Hotmail get your free account today and so people started signing up and had this crazy viral coefficient and products like Cloud poker night have a different kind of virality which I think I don't know what it's called but group virality or something um similar to how Eventbrite grows or meetup.com grows which is an attendee becomes a host so a host creates an event naturally they need to invite a bunch of other people because that's how an event works and then you might be in the 100 people that attend some event and if you liked that experience the next time you're thinking about hosting an event you'll go use that same product because you got sort of it was incepted into your brain through somebody else so I think the same thing will happen here what I would want to do is I'd want to host a bunch of these for fun using the MFM Community but then guess what the MFM Community when they have a good experience as a player would then host if there could be a team bonding night or their corporate events or sales sales events or whatever um for their businesses and I think that's how these businesses can grow yeah I think it's cool what's uh what what do you want to do Cricket crit cut or gamer dating idea I'll do the gamer dating okay so um Sam here's why you should date a gamer I know you're married but if you could go back here's why you should have dated a gamer and me too my wife she doesn't play any games um I just bought a PS5 hoping that maybe that would sway her she instead just got upset so here's why you should date a gamer you're not a gamer are you I'm like the least gamer gamer I'm in the club but just barely I'm by the door by the end I'm by the exit door I played Call of Duty last night for like the first time in a year it's impossible these kids are talking it's so difficult I'm unbelievably so it sucks also all the popular games now they're like pubg it's like yeah you jump out of an airplane I'm like oh wow that sounds exciting and then it's like you land and now you just sort of walk around look like you live in 20 minutes and then you're not gonna see anybody during that whole time you're just gonna be collecting supplies I'm like okay cool but for what it's like because then when you do see someone I'm like but I never see anyone like yeah that's the problem you're just gonna get shot in the head and it's gonna start again and it's like these games where nothing happens it's crazy um anyways here's why you should date by the way I I played I played Call of Duty last night and I played this thing where it's three guys we're on a team and we have to do [ __ ] together and it was two guys that must have been friends and they was talking to each other in Spanish and I was so I was so bad that I couldn't see or hear or understand they were writing I couldn't understand any of the words that they were saying other than bot this is a bot he's so bad it's a vamanos and they quit on me because I was so bad just bought vamanos like that's all that's not bad I remember I got called a bot and I thought it was a good thing because I was like oh Aimbot I must be on like on lock that they're calling me a bot and then I was like no this is they're they're saying this is like an NPC all right so here let me do my bit here here's how you should date a gamer they're smart they um you'll never have to worry about where they are on a Friday night you know they're just gonna be in the room playing you know they're not at the club they're not not doing anything scandalous um they'll fight for you should date a gamer they'll they'll stand up for you they're used to going to war on these things um they're easy to trick into doing things because you just give them a badge or a level or some sort of you know Medallion and they'll just grind for that for that prize uh they're tech savvy they can set up your internet and fix stuff when everything's broken um and they'll always give you space if you're the tempers that need space they'll give you space but here's the problem you may want to date a gamer after that great sales pitch but the problem is there's no gamer dating app and that's my idea I think there should be an app for gamers to meet other Gamers here's why this matters wouldn't it be a sausage fest I mean how many gamers are women all dating apps for sausage fest that's the trick the guys only see the girls the girls only see the guys unless you switch the settings right so it's like um yes like all dating apps the ratio will be 30 to one that's that's expected uh but that's that's normal for a dating app here's why I think it's cool um I think Gamers have a lot in common I think gamers are a pretty big Market there's hundreds and hundreds of millions of Gamers out there like gaming the gaming industry makes more than money than Hollywood right so it's like if you think people like movies people like games more um but there's no easy way to meet a gamer and if you meet a gamer you actually have a lot of comment and you might have things to do in common and so I think one of the hard Parts about dating apps is that they're all profiles um and flirts and not really dates and then a bunch of companies came in and were like we're gonna get you on a date um but then the reality was like getting people out into the real world to go on a date is kind of like really really high friction and matching them was a pain in the ass I did a bunch of those I think that gamer dating would work because you could be like cool you matched you guys are both interested in each other and you might put you have some games in common because that's part of your profile what games you guys both like to already play go Squad up play again go play Call of Duty together and in doing so you're gonna be talking you're gonna be doing something together it's like going bowling or going puppet golf but just more fun and so I think somebody could this is a legit idea first I was gonna save this for a drunk ideas episode and then it kind of grew on me I was like no no this could actually work like if you think this can't work let me remind you that there is a dating app called Farmers Only right there's there's dating apps called Black People Meet and those are those that work if you think those can work and Gabriel dating can't work you're nuts game-relating could definitely work and it could definitely be big definitely go sell it a match for like 75 million dollars in three years is Farmers Only still a thing uh you know I haven't checked in on a little while but they used to run like TV commercials yeah yeah you haven't been keeping tabs they're like still that looks very old yeah still paying the hosting all right they're doing 700k in monthly visits so not bad that's so funny um what's your name for it uh I don't have one just yet yo working title TBD um open to suggestions yeah I think it's a pretty bad idea well I sold it pretty hard so that's just funny I mean maybe dude dating apps suck that's the worst business there is man because only like three or four of them it's like a winner taking all Market you know what I mean there's tons of dating apps I mean who's the winner that took all Tinder no what Bumble no uh batch e-harmony nope okay Cupid no it's like social media where it's like there could be you know there's hundreds of social media platforms but there's like four that matter um do you know what I mean I remember when I was at Monkey Inferno a guy came to the office getting KJ and he's like I'm gonna make an Indian like you know there's Jewish dating apps there's farmer dating apps there's black people dating apps I'm gonna make an Indian dating app I was like all right that's a good idea I guess and I was like do you have any background on this he's like I'm in the end and I'm trying to date and he's like you know that's my background I was like okay I guess super qualified and then he's like um he's like here's what we're gonna do differently and he's like I was like so what are the features like what do you have to do to differentiate he's like well I told you it's an Indian dating app so the app's gonna say this is for Indians trying to meet other Indians I was like oh he's right that is actually the main feature is that you're going to curate the people and sort of filter for people who want to meet other Indians for farmers who want to meet other Farmers whatever for Jewish people want to meet other Jewish people and so I was like okay I guess that is already better than Tinder if you're in any person who wants to be an Indian because you're going to get 100 hit rate here versus maybe uh five percent hit rate on a generic dating app and I was like okay so how do you make money he's like do you know how much people pay for dating apps like the is it I'll do the same business model I was like all right I'm trying to poke holes but he's just got it covered and I was like but how are you gonna like I was like what do Indians care about more than others he goes oh that's where I'm gonna do something different I'll go okay here it is what's the big feature what's the big Tech breakthrough he's like like your mom is your like co-user you log in with LinkedIn and I go what and he goes yeah he's like because I don't know if people know this like Indian culture it's like a big deal of like uh there's like a chat Indian people date on like a checklist it kind of stems from like the arranged marriage background where literally you marry on a checklist you know what the pickup line is for like I have most of my friends are Indian because you and Neville my best friend's Indian the pickup line when you're around other Indians is so what do you do that's basically like that's like what they do yeah so basically he was like you're gonna log in with LinkedIn so we know that you have like a legit job and uh I was like okay and then he's like yeah that's like the main thing that you know helps separate people you know I was like whoa um so he builds this app it's called Bill Mill and he uh which means like hearts mate um how do you spell it d-i-l-m-i-l who builds this app and I'm keeping track of this guy and he uh and sure enough he just starts going into like all the niche communities newsletters blogs YouTubers starts promoting it running ads basically saying hey if you're an Indian person you're tired of striking out on dating apps because Indian people have like terrible success rates on Indian apps on on normal dating apps I think Okay Cupid said that like the worst like in the in the free market of dating I think the absolute worst was an Indian male second a close second was like Chinese mail um they were like the two least desirable according to the OKCupid match data that they've released and you know what the highest was I think the highest the most liked person I think was an Asian woman yeah exactly I think it was a Asian woman was was number one um because they were getting all the attention from the Asian guys and the white guys I think it was like the the data with what it showed is like they get like it's like top preference amongst two big user groups or something and there's this like weird stereotype that like uh Asian women are supposed to be more submissive and dumb [ __ ] like that and I think that there's like some weird like Kinks out there of of like a true white guy um I'm like no it's like men who have happened really captured this like mothers so hey it's on the it's on Christian Rudder wrote that blog post the founder of Okay Cupid I think that's like the whole thing their blog posts were great that was a great strategy they had um anyway so he whatever five years later he sells this thing I think he sold it for 75 or 100 million dollars to uh to the match no way and they were like yeah we match group is a collection of dating apps we have our our generic catch-all Mass Market apps Tinder um uh and uh what's the other one um Match.com and then they have like all the niche apps and so they own like 20 dating apps or something like that and so if you just fill one of those verticals that they don't have a winner in um they'll buy you at like a preset multiple and I was like wow that's pretty impressive they paid 50 million dollars for it I don't know man this guy KJ he's pretty good looking and now he's rich I think he I think he he's probably doing anything they went up with him the other day and he was like you didn't believe and I was like I was like well you're right I didn't believe and uh actually sort of you know when I didn't believe I really wanted to be right I'm sorry about that I was kind of rooting against you in a way but then you proved me wrong and you were absolutely right congratulations you did a great job have have you seen the Indian Netflix show where it's like your parents are setting you up with like this Matchmaker dude so at first I thought that shit's the worst where uh you know I'm like your parents are just telling you what to do but when you think about it it's kind of like it's kind of like the uh Paradox of choice right where they're just like this is it this is the one you were doing this uh you kind of are forced to find happiness in that and it doesn't seem actually maybe the worst arranged marriages are they I have no idea are they bad or is it kind of they can be and they can't be I think the stats show it's about the same divorce rate as in America but what that doesn't show is that any people don't get divorced they like you know they're like we will suffer in this unhappy marriage rather than get divorced and be happy and but have Society know that we failed at our marriage or whatever whatever so I I don't think there's a way to really know how successful or unsuccessful it is uh me and uh me and by the way a quick indeed story it means Neville were out to dinner with darmesh at HubSpot and Neville was saying how he doesn't he's like man India like that's where I'm from and I go back there and it makes you grateful to be in America because like these guys got nothing and like it's not very nice over there this and that and he was like not insulting uh like poor Indians but like saying like it's like a pain in the butt to be in that situation and darmaster was like yeah that was me I was that guy I had nothing and I came here uh we were I was like one of those guys like we you know we had nothing and uh they were all just talking about India India sounds like a wild place man it just seems a lot of people describe things like that because how do you uh you know you can only agree with that can't really disagree with X is a wild place it's the same thing as our business pitch of like it's this just beautifully done we're just gonna do it beautifully it's the same thing it's like dude that's a wild place it's like what the food the cult the crime what are we talking about here's the story you told the story you told is that when your mom came to America I don't know if you were joking or not you said tooth except blew my mind you said the first thing you said she she had never used utensils you said that do you remember saying that this is all blood record you're like she didn't use utensils that's what you told that's what you said on that spot um you no I am not I'm not putting any judgment here I am repeating what you said the second thing you said you go wait when she went to hang up the phone she didn't know how to hang up the phone so she just let it like hang on the bathroom and it was a while to hear that story that that was it was like it made me love your mom is what it did she told me the story it was unbelievable she's like I got on the plane I'd never been on a plane before my parents just dropped me off at the airport I'm 17 years old I've never been on a plane before don't even know what a plane is really uh I just get shuffled along I show somebody my ticket they send me here send me there okay I get on a plane and she's like I think it's like a train that's all I've ever seen as a train and so I'm just thinking this is gonna be like a train ride and she's flying like 14 hours tell her that it goes in there her parents didn't know either they never been on a train a plane either they were just like this is how you get to America and she was like okay didn't ask don't ask too many questions and so she she's like I you know plain seat belts are kind of funky she's like I did it I just like put it pushed it and I went in on the first try somehow miraculously and the person next to me looked at me was like oh you've flown before and she's like I was like oh my God I don't even know what I'm getting myself into no I have no idea what I just did I have no idea how I'll get this off and um whatever I guess I have a few hours to figure out how to unbuckle this by the time I need to get off to at my stop so then for 14 hours you're flying and she stays awake because she's like I don't want to miss my stop and she's like this thing's not stopping what's going on she like doesn't know how planes work it was crazy the whole thing was insane doesn't that make you feel soft your mom your mother is so much more Brave than we are it makes me feel uh incredibly lucky that uh you know she did all the hard stuff so that I don't have to do it yeah shout out it's like a shout out mom bird moms like chew food and then just spit it in their baby's mouth so they don't have to chew that's what I feel like she did with life she's just like chewed life for me and then spitted in my mouth and I just have like the easy life um and on that visual [Laughter] um all right well

job interviews became infinitely easier after I learned how to walk up to attractive women because if you can walk up to an attractive you know 10 out of 10 and not get nervous going into a job interview is just like is butter whereas before it used to be super nervous you know you're in the waiting room overthinking the entire situation anything that could be anxiety-inducing is just out of sight out of mind so for me I think there is a huge overlap business presentations became so much easier became more confident in rooms meeting new people whether it was talking to dudes or talking to chicks didn't matter

it's useful for crypto users to use a VPN and so that was one of my ideas about we sold before we got around to doing that that would have been cool if you would have done that that would have been that's a pretty cool move too bad [Music] all right what's up we got John Coogan here uh John somebody who I only know through a lunch at a Mexican restaurant in La and that's the best way to meet anybody who's gonna be a podcast guest so uh you you got a crazy background I'll give people The Rundown if they don't know who who you are so you've uh been an entrepreneur your whole life never had a job started two companies that were both really interesting Soylent which was basically making a uh a meal replacement drink is the easiest way to explain it tasted like the milk of Honey Nut Cheerios which I always appreciated and then Lucy gum which was like a nicotine gum both of them went through YC together they've raised over 130 million dollars a bunch of good lessons there um you're also an eir at Founders fund which is one of the more interesting places to to kind of hang out or be a part of and uh like us you've made the mistake of leaving entrepreneurship to just be a YouTuber and this is great so you know how to make content too which is which is amazing you make really awesome videos uh Sam was sending me one this morning Sam you like his stuff huh I love it yeah I like your stuff John I uh by the way Sean I'm an investor of Lucy so I gotta get that out of the way and probably a user too at one point for sure but I mean I think you did invest like four years ago so you know the fact that I haven't been on yet I think I earned my stripes by posting on YouTube playing in the content world you know yeah what is your guys I don't even know can you say the valuation is I think I invested 25 000 at a 10 million evaluation and ten yeah you were probably in like this seed round and now the company's worth like 60 70 mil all right on paper I've made a little bit of money yeah not bad we had I think we could tell this story we had one of the other co-founders of Lucy come on the Pod once and this guy we had met him at a at some like event maybe a hustle event so some some night time event and this guy was holding course that was Dave Dave yeah he was telling stories there's five people around him he's got ideas yeah he's like oh there needs to be something called Pleasure Island and it's a place where you could just go sin and I was like Wow who is this guy what is he talking about and he's telling stories he's amazing everybody's just in captured by this guy I'm like we gotta have this guy at the Pod he comes on the pod tells none of the stories and none of the ideas he's like no I don't want to test all those on the pond and we were like dude and so I don't even think we ever ran the episode because he refused to tell the good stuff so John will you make the same mistake as your pal absolutely not I mean I I do think a lot of Founders have a just a ton of scar tissue built up from like the last 10 years of like the media just going after Tech Founders and like Tech Bros programmers like it was really aggressive for a while there like anything you said would be like taken out of context putting some click bait but now that Elon bought Twitter and kind of just like caused enough chaos like you can just say whatever you want and there's like no I I I've been telling every every founder I know like cancel culture is over like don't worry about things just say whatever you believe so we're gonna do some of your philosophy some of the the philosophies like cancer culture is over but first let's run through the background here because both of these startups normally we try not to spend too much time on the guess with the background but yours both are so interesting um can you just tell us uh you know give us the origin story for Soylent because when this came out it was a very different idea than anything I was seeing anybody do in Silicon Valley nobody was at that time this was maybe 2012 I had just moved to San Francisco and uh you had kind of like uber and Airbnb but very few people were in the in the San Francisco Venture Community were doing like like a like a drink or like a product that you could eat you could drink um that wasn't software based and but still was Innovative and so it was like kind of in this mix and I remember Andrew said Horowitz got behind it and some others and so it was a very interesting thing and I think it started out of like a hacker house right like you guys had a crazy house is that right yeah uh I mean a bunch of funny stories from that this was the yeah Warby Parker was like the first e-commerce company to kind of think about it from like a tech first angle uh we were a couple years after them um right around the same era as like Dollar Shave Club if you remember that company um but yeah we met in a hacker house uh my my co-founder and I we went to preschool middle school high school together went to college in the same city and so we moved out to Silicon Valley we're looking for a place we find something on uh like Craigslist it's like an Airbnb listing and they're like this place is incredible it's got a pool it's got five bedrooms it's exactly like the social network you're gonna love it we show up the pool is filled with algae the bathrooms don't work it's just absolute squalor so we grind for like six months there eventually we moved to the tenderloin which is an even nicer community and and uh we're living in technically a one bedroom with three guys so I I was living in the living room another guy uh Rob the guy who actually came up with the idea for Soylent he was living what was technically a closet because it didn't have a window and we were just we were just hacking we were just not a lot of dating going on yeah not a lot of dating um not a lot of anything just wake up program go to sleep wake up program go to sleep and we just had sticky notes on the wall being like okay after this idea fails we'll build this next idea all all the worst ideas you've ever heard on here when people come on and they give you their bad ideas like like we were building the mall and they were all failing give us a couple what were they like take a picture and it puts it through a filter and it puts it on a shirt and it like mails you the shirt like it's just like weird stuff like that there were some ideas that were good they were just like way before their time like uh do you know Google stadia it allows you to play video games and the cloud streams it to you like we basically built that but it was just like five years too early and also we didn't have a trillion dollars of data centers for free like Google does so it like and even stadia I think failed so like even Google couldn't pull it off and so of course we weren't going to be able to get it done so there's just a lot of those ideas where it was like too early wrong team bad execution or just terrible go to market like there were some things that we built that were pretty good but it just didn't work and living with Rob living with Rob would be odd because I know Rob he's he's a he's so unique and eccentric and weird and in such an interesting way yeah so he'd been writing on his blog and posting on Hacker News and he wrote a bunch of basically viral clickbait targeted at programmer so he speaking of dating he wrote a a a blog post saying how he hacked Tinder and and he was saying this was before like Bots and stuff so he basically claimed he didn't really do this it was more just like for satire and for fun but he said he wrote a script that would automatically swipe right on everything and then and then generative AI talked to this was like 10 years ago too but like talk to them talk to the person and then it would use the Uber API to call them a car and then he would order doordash and deliver the food and so like the the punch line at the end of the at the end of the story was basically like he wasn't involved at all because it was like you know you can you can imagine where that goes but basically he had he built a little bit of a following on Hacker News and so when the the question was like we like building these software companies we like coding and building stuff launching businesses but we are going to run out of money and we're going to have to get jobs so we need to look at our expenses and understand where are we burning money we paid a rent a year in advance I think we were paying fifteen hundred dollars for three dudes to live in the heart of San Francisco oh like crazy low money we owned our laptops paid our internet bill like there was really no cost other than food and so figuring out how to get food as cheap as possible was like a very logical you know conclusion from that so Rob starts whipping up the powders figures out this meal replacement he's like instead of buying a cheeseburger over here or some groceries over there let me buy uh 200 pound sack of protein powder do you remember that first conversation when he's like guys I got it we'll just get a bunch of powders and then that'll be the food like is that yeah is that literally or two they were yeah there were two phases the first phase was he told me like oh I'm I'm doing this diet experiment I think it's going to make me healthier I'm gonna you know monitor all my macros and micros and start working out and get in shape and I was just like who cares what we look like like oh the only thing that matters is like our code and like our business ideas like we don't we don't which is very stupid because obviously you do need to be healthy to like be productive um so that was a stupid take by me um but I kind of wrote it off and then he kept doing it for a few weeks and then we were at uh it's like a dinner with a friend she'd made like homemade sushi and I mean that's like a treat when you're broke and he was like no I'm not gonna eat I'm on this Soylent thing and I was like this is crazy it's so I mean it's sort of like that Brian Johnson before Brian Johnson you know yeah yeah yeah it's the stress test so basically uh he told me that I was like do you have a name for this and he was like I'm calling it Soylent and I knew the reference and I was like this genius we need to sell this today like this is like like this is going to be the market entry strategy because it's going to be so viral but yeah I mean he basically did a stress test he lived on it for 30 days and then people would just be like yeah I think this ingredient's stupid or I think this is bad but like hey if you survived 30 days only on this like I can probably take a sip and see how it tastes and so it created this curiosity when we launched my content company the hustle one of the first early viral video uh viral you uh articles was I paid a guy two G's to live on it for 30 days while he was running 70 miles a week as like a amateur Runner yeah may he rest in peace yeah and that's what made the story go viral the the silent thing that was the gift that kept on giving particularly I mean for me as well you know like I I I got traffic from it too yeah and it was it was like a left right issue everybody hated it uh and then you'd post it and then this was back in the day when like the Facebook algorithm was like entirely comment driven so people would correct us and they'd be like oh you made a mistake you name you accidentally named your company after a movie with Charlton Heston in it that's a sci-fi movie and it's like no obviously we did that on purpose like what are you talking about but that the fact that there would be that comment and then another person would come in and be like oh well there's actually this book and somebody like oh you need to fire your marketing people be like oh I actually got the reference and then they'd be talking every single time we posted anything in addition to all the comments about is this good is this bad what does it mean for society so just massive viral fuel any any article went viral and so we were able to kind of trade up the chain and go from Vice news to you know the hustle to BBC to the New York Times times New Yorker and then eventually Rob was on The Colbert Report with sitting next to Stephen Colbert is crazy well it's definitely shows the power of a viral product but also it was my first time learning about signal so like I had never bought a fancy watch or a car or jacket or anything but the first time I was seeing you holding a Soylent it was like this crazy signal was going out to the world I was like I'm in Tech first of all you know that just by this drink you don't have to ask anything else all right maybe you've looked at this brown guy in San Francisco probably would have guessed that one okay what what else does it tell you it tells you like I value productivity yeah Brown guy it's Selma you know like backpack is like sagging to the back of my knees with somebody like accessories so so then it's like number two is like you value productivity over yep things like taste maybe even things like Health right like oh yeah everything yeah yeah so it's a value signal then it was like a contrarian signal and it was like I don't give a [ __ ] what you think about me signal it was so powerful as a signaling tool for like this one year period yeah but that actually Cuts both ways because food is such a signal and there's so much badge value it's very hard to accrue like Monopoly power and how do you actually go about disrupting Nestle if if every if every food is like an extension of personal expression it gets very hard because as soon as everyone is doing one thing I'm going to want to do something different and so there's this constant like ping-ponging in these products so it's very very hard to create like one brand to rule them all you said something about Peter Thiel uh talk to me and for one in one hour he diagnosed everything that would go wrong in my business was that about Soylent yeah what did what did Peter tell you yeah I mean we went in for like the pitch and sat down and did like kind of a working session and uh I mean now everyone knows the framework because he's written the book zero to one it's it's like incredibly popular everyone kind of knows that you know the the way Venture back companies accrue value is through moats the development of moats and you know the Hamilton Helmer has the powers framework Peter has you know different um different Theses around this and and we know the basics it's like you know brand intellectual property complex coordination scale economies Network economies right Network effects and so but at this time in 2013 everyone thought that there would just be a magical Network effect that would show up and that's just not true like so there was this weird dynamic where you know a lot of investors that we talked to were like oh yeah like you don't need to advertise you can just like like the people like it so much that they'll sell it to each other and that's true in a multi-level marketing scheme but it's not true if you don't build that infrastructure to make that happen so we never we never achieved like escape velocity there and he was just kind of like yeah like this is just a widgets business like run this like a you know any other business like you need to sell like you have product Market fit which we did like you just need to maximize you know your like run the Playbook of you know Market bring the customer in make sure you're bringing them in cheaper he was basically like this is a great lifestyle business guys congrats and and then we raised a bunch of venture and it was a disaster what was your Peak what was your Peak Revenue like almost 100 Mil almost 100 Mil and um I was reading you guys sold it recently and yeah not a good outcome all right I was gonna say no disrespect but the outcome sucked like for for how compared to the hype and your Peak Revenue I think it was like it was sold by a publicly traded company did I read it was sold for 60 million dollars uh something I mean not not a lot I I I I I actually like don't even know the exact Dynamics because there's a bunch of other like assets that were like rolled up and it's part of this combined thing but it was sold for like maybe as much or less than you raised you raised 100 million dollars yeah exactly which basically means like the common doesn't get anything got it so you you didn't get much you didn't get that wealthy from it yeah we got a decent amount but not like what we should have you know if we'd maximize how to do that company but then you started Lucy so Lucy is cool uh are you there full time right now no I'm like one day a week at Lucy um mostly helping out with stuff like this doing content and then ideally like brokering deals with other content creators like we want to do more we being Founders fun uh no no me being like the we being the Lucy team so to give some background you know Soylent is this nutrition product uh we run that for four or five years and then Lucy is a nicotine gum brand and nicotine pouch brand so if you're if your viewers are familiar with Zinn uh you know we're a direct competitor is in but we differentiate on Flavor strength and a couple others dude all day every day type of Zen guy yeah yeah I imagine most people in the audience are it's extremely I just wish that Lucy sold it at 7-Eleven because going to the gas stations like part of my routine you know I gotta go see my boys there and hang out and I mean 100 that is uh that is the name of the game and that was what will actually unlock like massive value in the Lucy business 100 people should know that by the way when you when you email Sam you're like hey I know you're a super busy guy and someone to keep this brief Sam's busy at 7-Eleven shooting the [ __ ] with his boys on the curb those lotto tickets don't scratch themselves my friend he's is busy just in a different way than you expect I gotta drop off like a pallet of Lucy at that exact 7-Eleven just be like here it's free now Sam can get his well you the the Lucy things are cool because basically a Zen is just a pouch but uh Lucy has it's called a breaker and so you like bite into this and you get like a little Menthol or something like a flavor I love it I like the Citrus yeah it's like it's like a liquid flavoring so yeah I mean a lot of people complain that the pouches although they're they're much better than the pouch of the previous years they dry your mouth out and that's the number one complaint so we figured it out you know how do we address that well let's just actually take liquid flavoring and put it inside a capsule then and then when you break it it moistens the pouch and then it doesn't dry your mouth out gotcha all right and let's talk about ideas so those two ideas you did I would say are the like top one percent of weirdo ideas which means I love it and I love you yeah what are your other weirdo ideas that you're not doing uh you sent us a couple of bullet points but explain them so let's let's run through some of your ideas yeah I mean I think the first one that would be interesting to talk about just because you know you guys are obviously creating as well is um just this idea of a creator-owned VPN so we've seen that vpns might be the number one Advertiser on YouTube I don't have the exact stats but anyone who's listened to a podcast or you watched a YouTube video can probably name five different vpns and yet none of them are venture-backed there's not like one or they're not like majorly Venture back they're not big Venture winners there's not like one that's running away have you researched these guys yeah yeah a little bit they're like all in Panama or Maldo the the mod or what's it called Moldova like Maldives I've tried looking them up on um LinkedIn because I did a ton of research on about this specifically I did a lot of research on the VPN review website so there was one called compare Tech that was doing 14 million in Revenue 13 million in profit like I saw their financials and they sold yeah to a VPN company and I was like these VPN companies are crazy uh but I looked all up I looked up the employees on LinkedIn and like you can't find their employees on LinkedIn even though they're companies that are doing 300 400 million dollars a year in Revenue yeah yeah yeah it's a very very odd space and basically like there's no there's no big like Venture winner there's no like oh Airbnb we all know the CEO he's taking the company public you know there's no like there's no like front-facing company that's like oh this one's winning and gonna run away with it it's more like there's a bunch of them they all print cash and there's not really going to be one winner because there's no network effect again it's uh it's it doesn't have a big moat the moat is marketing and that's why they all spend on marketing and that's how they differentiate is just you check all the boxes how big are they easily easily in the billions um for for the aggregate industry and like you said they're certain that are doing there's certain vpns that are doing hundreds of millions of dollars of sales and so the name of the game is just check all the boxes so that no no VPN reviewer who's independent can like take you down and be like there's a fatal flaw and do not use this VPN because I know for a fact it doesn't do the right thing but once you've actually implemented all the features where yes we do we check all these boxes then it's just a marketing game and that's why you see them is it just a commodity like with I I don't know much about the VPN Tech like is it uh is it terribly complicated it is complicated programming wise like it's it's somewhat complicated to write the code I guess but it's not complicated from like understanding the features the customer wants you're not trying to create some sort of and you called it beastvpn so what's your business idea here yeah I called it vs VPN I call it Beast VPN because obviously Mr Beast is the biggest Creator and he is an interesting place where he has an international audience he has a an audience that's it's just it's just everyone his audience is everyone and so what's a product that you can sell all everywhere across the world that's very high margin low churn VPN and that's why VPN are advertising all over YouTube is because it doesn't matter if the ad is served to someone in Japan or India or Europe like the vpn's available there so I'll give this idea a 9 out of 10. nice what I like about this idea is exactly what you said it takes the weakness of Creator businesses which is you get a bunch of low value kind of uh subscribers maybe like you know some the value of a random subscriber in India random subscriber in Croatia it's like hard to get ad money for that type of viewer but this product is actually even better for international people than it is for in the US so I think that's one big strength and then obviously recurring Revenue uh digital good or Victoria Revenue software is obviously amazing I only give it a nine instead of a ten just because it's the first idea and I'm not that easy so I gotta I gotta talk to one point just on that alone also to be fair uh it might make more sense for like a Linus Tech tips and an MKBHD to do this because they're more of like tech people we were gonna do this at milk Road actually when we built the road we're like okay cool we're making money we're profitable on just newsletter ads but I was like what's the best product we could do I was like what if we did a crypto a VPN for the crypto economy because we're at that time we're you know one of the more trusted Brands where like it's kind of a commodity software it's useful for crypto users to use a VPN and so that was one of my ideas about we sold before we got around to doing that that's a good idea that's a good idea you should have that would have been cool if you would have done that that would have been that's a pretty cool move too bad well they still the guys still own milk Rod so we still own a part of it I'm gonna tell them after this and be like hey guys let's revive this I mean the main thing is that you just have to have the the distribution you've listed uh Linus Tech tips on your you said do you know this guy well no I just saw him so you said that uh what's the guy's name Marquis what's that guys what's his channel MKBHD March yeah I like him everyone knows him uh he's cool this guy Linus Tech tips has 15 million subscribers yeah oh my God what and like I mean he he has a team that's like you know I think over a hundred people wow multiple channels podcasts like everything he actually built his own like media platform where you can like go in and watch videos and and talk to each other it's like a forum site and he just released like a screwdriver and sold like five million dollars of a screwdriver or something like that yeah I'm sure I'm sure he did great on that the question is like would he have done better if instead of buying a screwdriver which needed to be bought probably locally or it was really expensive to ship internationally he sold something that was recurring software that was 99 margin of VPN the only thing is that honestly the screwdriver is cooler than a VPN so you know I can't fault him because the screwdriver is like you get to build your hacker you get to put your PC together like that's fun VPN it's it's a little boring I use a VPN though I like vpns all right what you got second idea yeah so uh uh the obviously Americans love guns you're an American you own some guns uh that's not changing we've seen through you know the past few decades that like you're like real like restrictions on guns are not coming and so the business is probably pretty durable we've seen that the the stocks of munition companies are doing fine over the last decades um but the price is increasing a lot of that's just due to supply chains but there might be some more structural issues also just more people are hunting more people are are buying guns and buying ammunition and obviously shooting is just a fun hobby so the the over the last three years the price of shotgun shells went from ten dollars to sixteen dollars pretty big increase and there's this massive shortage so the the idea here is basically like maybe you need a new um maybe we need to bring some some efficiency to the ammunition supply chain and I think it's an interesting idea I don't actually know enough about how to run an Ammunition Depot or ammunition Factory but what I do know is that the hottest Trend right now in business is like Roll-Ups or search funds and every guy who graduates from HBS is like I'm gonna go roll up laundromats or I'm gonna go roll up dentists dentists it's like everyone has an idea for these things and they're all very commodity they're not very contrarian and so there's probably not a lot of alpha there but it's like the guy the people that are coming out of HBS are probably not saying I'm gonna go roll up weapons manufacturers and obviously like Android is crushing it in the Venture side but they're doing like insane software Hardware building drones building like these really Advanced AI powered weapon systems this is not that you do this company you buy a bunch of you know all we do is make shotgun shells you buy three of them you move the employees around you kind of optimize things a little bit it's just like a very boring life like you know know private Equity style roll up and then maybe hit a cruise power over time because obviously it is a massive industry but you're not coming in and trying to reinvent the wheel you're not being like we're going to actually 3D print the shell or something no it's just like good operations there's a lot of gun YouTubers you know we could we could mix that oh yeah yeah we could get them in do you live in California I do I do are you guys even so I used to live in California I live in Texas now I I own guns because I have a ranch and it's fun for shooting are you guys even allowed to own guns in California yes we're allowed to own guns no like what's the rule uh no no I mean you can there's a whole bunch of restrictions on like rifles like certain capacity magazines but the I think most recently like it's pretty easy to get a concealed carry permit in San Francisco it's kind of a narrative violation wait what I I thought for years that was impossible yeah most people think it's like Unthinkable but in fact it it is becoming easier which is kind of crazy um but yeah I mean obviously California is not like a dream state for for you know if you're gun fan but Sean Sean you've been talking about getting your conceal and carry for years now right not at all um guns scare me but uh I did look at investing in an ammunition roll-up I'm trying to find the the deck you did that's hilarious uh yeah we got introduced to somebody who was doing it and I was like I love this idea but it was so far field uh out of like what I'm used to investing in that I was like and I didn't know I was like how do you know yeah how do you know that they can actually do the due diligence like if you can't do the due daily exactly I don't think I would touch this I wouldn't touch this either why I wouldn't want this in my obituary that I you know even though and I and I and I I understand how that's hypocritical you know I criticized Sean because Sean wants to like invest in only fan companies and I'm like I'm not touching that but at the same time I consume porn so like there's definitely like a little bit of uh I I acknowledge the hypocrisy yeah but like you know I guess I guess you know it doesn't have to be black and white it's Shades of Gray and like me I I prefer to stay on the wider of the of that side yeah yeah I mean that's totally fair and I think that's why there might be Alpha in this area because I think that dummies like you Sam that's what that's why why this opportunity exists because that made no sense they made tons of sense dude what are you talking about you're like I love guns I enjoy them I buy them I'm buying I'm buying the ammunition but you know I don't want to support I don't want to invest in it because only bad people would buy it like what does that mean no no I didn't say only bad people I said I don't want to own it I didn't say I said that I I buy the stuff I use it I think it's very enjoyable I love shooting for fun but that doesn't mean I want to make it my career I mean Sam would would your opinion change if we were actively at in a hot War like it's your duty to America to optimize the ammunition supply chain because there are like there there are troops from you know some country Landing in the beaches of California would my opinion change yeah of course yeah and that's totally fair and my opinion could change about the whole thing I'm very open to new uh data points and changing my opinion uh uh I'm just saying like yeah like Andrew like I love Andrew I I like I think that's a very patriotic Mission but I know 100 owning Remington like right now I'm like uh I don't know man like yeah I could probably make money in other ways and my contest would be a little less like it would be it's very it's just an easier decision Sam I got I got a question for you there's a thing going viral on Tick Tock right now that's uh girlfriends asking their boyfriends or you know wives dads and their husbands something I'll be the wife here I'm gonna ask you a question uh that they're asking Hey when's the last time or how no how often do you think about the Roman Empire anything to do with the Roman Empire oh all the time a lot like why under what circumstances would you need to think about that just like uh like Gladiators and [ __ ] just like battling to the death in front of everyone when's the last time you thought about something like that like this week last night I mean the funny thing here is that like the the meme immediately before that was like the in the arena Meme and everyone in Tech was posting literal like Roman Empire gifs because everyone in Tech is like obsessed with the arena and I know that there are two separate communities like that's not why the meme popped up but it's like yeah it's so funny to see all these women are like they're like they they see somebody asked the question the guy answers some exactly almost Verbatim what Sam just said always always it's like I'm thinking about it right now all the time yeah like what do you mean of course and my wife has a video of that where I didn't know about the meme and she takes out her phone videos me is like oh she asked you think about the Roman Empire yeah and I was like I'm thinking about it right now why and then all the comments are like you know that makes you know that's crazy and then they come back reply like I just asked he said last week he said he thinks about it twice a week he's like yeah they're like I can't fathom why this man who doesn't take out the trash on time who forgot to pick up our daughter from preschool why he is thinking about the Roman Empire twice a week dude I think about 9 11 in World War II like 90 of my day like do you guys not think like what would I do if I was on that plane you know what I mean like think about that constantly I think about that constantly or like it's just a very normal masculine urge like there's this joke Shane girls he's like just so you know being obsessed with history particular World War II is a precursor to becoming a Republican like you know it's early onset wait Sean you don't think about like World War II like on a regular basis no but I have my own version of it which is like I'm constantly like I if I walk into a place I'm like assessing how if I had to how would I like Rob this place or like if some [ __ ] went down like what's the move all right what's the move okay there's some sort of like masculine daydreaming that happens like my buddy David like he he imagines like ninjas coming through every door and window and how he would like take them out tactically like that's his dude every time I'm in a baggage claim I'm like I could take any of these bags right now and just walk out there is no security in this place are you kidding me like the baggage claimed I I will never get over that why it's so easy to just take anyone's bag my wife and I got to dinner we have like a rule Sam's back does not sit to the front door I have to see the front door like you know like I can't have people coming in without me knowing I've got to see my front door yeah I do think it's a man thing you know uh John we there's this funny quote Scott Galloway said he goes uh um you should exercise so you can kill and eat most everyone in a room or be able to outrun them uh and that's like at its root that's kind of like what we're talking about right now yeah yeah yeah 100 yeah uh John I want to ask you you um so Sam is basically like clearly just like surging on testosterone you uh are eir at Founders fund which is I remember at one point when they were talking about PayPal they said uh oh you know Max left should interviewed some engineer back in the early days of PayPal and then he was like no no can't hire this guy it's like what he passed everyone else's test he's like he plays basketball I don't know any great program who goes and plays basketball three times a week that's not a thing and so they were like very anti-jock um do you get to hang out with the founders fun people a lot like do you hang out in person at all and what's that like because seems like a room full of very interesting very different people yeah it is it's uh It's oddly they've done a great job of not creating a monoculture in a very small organization so yeah there are definitely like complete jocks that I mean obviously we know Keith for boys that berries like five times a day yeah I don't know if I would call Keith or boy a jock uh but uh like why do you use like a workout not he's a fitness nut for sure but berries yeah he's trying to be the best at sports you know he's trying to be the best at exercising why is that okay why no I'm just joking but why is that guy why is Keith's boys such a [ __ ] on Twitter like why does he behave that way he's he's like needlessly rude I think a lot of it is just like holding the line on like like when he sees something that's like not true he doesn't want to spread and so he just like shuts it down like really aggressively yeah he's like put it he's like he's put his flag in some silly things like Miami so it's like if Miami doesn't work it it's like gonna hurt him and it's like you know it doesn't have to you know you you could love it and also it's not the best a lot of these things are you know I think learned behaviors I think everyone in Tech is somewhat like like just injured from the past like for sure it's very obvious I'm just getting like just beat down for every little thing and so a lot of people have put up walls and I think that it's time I agree with you I think it's time to kind of take down the Walls be a little bit less defensive generally but I understand where all these behaviors are coming from what's Sean Parker up to we haven't heard about that guy in years yeah we got to get him back on Twitter because if you or asked because if you talk to anyone who knows him they will just say that he was the greatest poster of all time who's the best on Twitter now I mean probably like uh Rahul ligma Daniel Johnson like those type of guys right like do you guys remember that publicity stuff that they did they fooled CNBC into reporting that they were Twitter employees that were fired it was very like that that's just like you know those guys um they're like doing a normal startup they're like building something Deadpool yeah no they're not like comedians they should have just gone all in on like oh [ __ ] we need to just create like this sort of like um some version of punked or like uh you know something for the tech industry they should have just gone all in as personality I would have dropped the startup in like six months sabbatical on the startup I'm just gonna see what happens if I fully Troll and like maybe I could be the thing that the community needs dude Rahul ligma still makes me like spit water out my nose when I hear that it's it's so funny it's so funny um yeah I don't know I mean how would you monetize that if they would you just be doing stand-ups I think it feels like silent donations from billionaires I've seen that guy and he only hangs out with successful billionaires when I've seen him in person like because everybody who was big in Tech loved that troll Elon loved it uh you know like the the holding guy's like oh my God it's the best it's the best I feel like they could have a patreon of billionaires only that just fund them to like do statement art uh you know like comedic statement or against the media against the local politicians against whatever that's what I would have done if I was them that's maybe that's not a bad idea but I don't know I I like it seems like they're pretty legit at what they're doing they're like actually good programmers I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better you have a thing on this document that I want to fight you about yeah yeah I knew this I was getting you again but here's the so John sent us this document he says unique philosophies lifestyle businesses are worthless what do you make your case you walk link yeah exactly no no I I this is mostly just like let's have a fun debate because I'm like you know working at a venture capital firm and I can kind of represent the VC crew and you guys are like the kings of like the lifestyle business so we aren't the kings of that by the way I want to be the king of it actually I I actually will accept that compliment I don't mind being the king of it what I'm saying is I think that we are one of the very few kind of content creators you pay proper respect to it yeah what I'm saying is we we we we do both we think both are cool that that's I there's very few people I think that are in the middle and I think we are in the middle yeah yeah yeah yeah that's fair that's fair um and so yeah basically I I think the point is just that uh lifestyle businesses are great Define that so I would say I I would say like non-venture-backed non-blit scaling non-hyperscaling non-monopoly something without a crazy moat where it's just like you go and work at it and maybe it gets really big and maybe you wind up being a billionaire but you didn't you didn't like do this growth at all costs insane thing then what's hyper growth uh two or three times a year I mean sometimes 10 times a year right um it depends on the scale at the early stages it goes really really fast but I I'm specifically thinking of like Facebook right I'm specifically thinking of the power law outcomes in Venture and my my point is that basically only about one percent of companies that get started raise Venture Capital but about 99 of the market cap in the public markets they took Venture and so venture has this very like ass like like disproportional outcome and I believe that that the bigger the company the bigger the impact on the world and so if you want to have a really really big impact you should actually be trying to raise money grow very grow very quickly like you're not going to build a hundred billion dollar company compounding it two percent a year five percent a year over your lifetime it just won't happen all right let me play the other side of that please your analogy of well okay so you're saying one percent uh or 90 uh 99 of the value is created by the one percent of companies that raise money so that to me is also saying that like look um 100 of the soldiers on D-Day who ended up uh killing like the Nazis that ended that battle they had to land on that beach anyway right so you might as well lay on that beach and I'm like yeah but the other one's got like [ __ ] killed and destroyed how about I just like not worry about killing Nazis and like I could just like start this little thing on the side you know what I mean like it's like it's like dude like this whole thing with like VC it's like you're funding all the you as the investor are funding all these companies and you're like dude I don't give a [ __ ] which one of you dies out here because I know one of you is gonna like make me my money and so from my perspective I'm like yeah so if I can get rich at with a higher likelihood which is maybe uh in most cases the number one reason for starting a business in not most cases like other cases it's like the number three version let's say your number one version is like I want to like create change getting rich is still up there so like if like if you can get rich and create value and have fun and work for yourself and have a higher likelihood of doing that why wouldn't you go that route so so the reason I think you shouldn't go with that route is because I think your overall impact on humanity and society and the world will be lower if if it survives yeah this whole question of would you rather own 100 of a 100 million dollar company or one percent of a 10 billion dollar company I don't even think it's a question obviously the 10 billion dollar company because the 10 billion dollar company is having a much larger impact on the world that quite that's that's not an obvious answer but no no no it's not it's not for for a lot of people they say I would rather have 100 and be able to go on vacation and you know chill and just have these cash flows come directly to me and not have to deal with like you know all this other stuff and I get that but my point is that like I believe that humans have a duty to each other to go and have the largest impact possible and that is often done with the backing of venture capitalists I don't think you believe that yeah I do wouldn't you not be like uh curing cancer instead of selling nicotine gum like let's uh let's be honest uh oh well I mean that's hilarious that you use that as an example because that's like the actually the best way to stop lung cancer is to get people to switch right yeah but don't let facts get the way of a good argument but but I I will actually synthesize this for you and I think we will agree on this point which is that what you should actually do with your life is pick the hardest most interesting most value creative problem that you are equipped to solve so can I create a cancer curing drug no I don't have that background it's not an option for me so I would fail if I went into that industry but I should pick the most ambitious thing and the best idea that I have and then I should be very rigorous about whether or not that idea is appropriate for venture capital and I think that if Mark Zuckerberg didn't raise Venture Capital his company would be dead and I think there's a lot of companies I've been a part of some of them where we raise cut we raise VC for com for a company that didn't need BC and it also killed the company I think so basically you have to you have to pick the best idea that you're equipped to solve and then decide the financing strategy that aligns with that and there's no one-size-fits-all solution do you wish you would have done a different idea instead of soylent or do you wish that you just hadn't taken VC and you got wealthy oh I don't know that's interesting I mean right before someone I was working on natural language generation in 2013 which is like the hottest Trend now and so if I'd probably just like stuck with that for a decade I'd probably be doing something cool right now maybe you I I think that you would have been more impactful if Soylent has it hadn't raised and you had gotten rich and then you would have been able to like say like something else well you would have been like I don't care about money as much so I'll just do this other crazy thing that is a moonshot like I I think it's I because I took a similar argument as you yeah and then uh someone corrected me and they're like yeah but it's a lot easier to go after moonshine ideas when you don't worry about a mortgage and as someone who had a bootstrap exit I agree I'm like it's pretty like I understand why Founders uh want to take secondary because you are more dangerous when you have 10 or 20 or 30 million dollars like you are more dangerous when you don't worry or you're like I'm rich enough that I don't have to worry but I'm not rich enough that I want to stop yeah I would 100 feel like I'm in that category like that that puts you in a dangerous category I think yeah I 100 feel that I'm in that category and and thus because that's true I think lifestyle businesses are awesome oh because it can get you there faster yeah yeah for sure yeah yeah get like the base hit before you do the big thing yeah not unreasonable and and I think that's also kind of a synthesis of what we're saying we kind of agree but that it's like moonshots are good but but the path might be circuitous to them right and there are freaks out there like an Elon like a Zuck well I don't know about Zack but like an Elon who's willing to risk it all yeah even Elon like PayPal could be framed as like less ambitious than SpaceX and Tesla right it's like the mission might not be as big who knows well he tweeted this out the other day uh and so Andrew Wilkinson had had tweeted something out like this that was like uh you know um you know he learned learn to crawl or learn to walk before you run yeah he's like most most people want to do a big crazy ambitious thing should start by doing a smaller thing so they learn how to do business and then do you know make things happen and then graduate up and a bunch of people were agreeing with him I totally disagreed I was like if you know the thing you want to do you should just go do the thing you know the way that doing something before you do your bigger thing works well I believe is at first that was the biggest thing you knew and then as you did it your world view expanded and your ambition expanded and you're the set of possibilities you were aware of expanded and then you went and did that thing however Elon did reply almost uh confirming what Andrew had said for him in his case he was like yeah you know I couldn't have created SpaceX if I didn't have the money and the skills and reputation as I had during zip2 and specifically somebody had said that like they had talked to Elon and he you know I don't believe this for the record I don't believe a word of this but they were like yeah I talked to Elon early on and or I talked to Elon and he said that early on he decided oh I want to die on Mars just not he said the following I would like to die on Mars just not on impact um and you know that's like his joke and then he's like and I decided the way to do that was I needed a lot of money um and so then I went to the internet just to go get the money quickly you know as quickly as I could I don't believe that to be true because um you know first of all not everybody is like that much of a mastermind you know when he was like sleeping under his desk as like a college kid I don't think that he was like being like I'm only doing this so that I can amass a fortune to launch three spaceships you know to be able to fund three of my own ships like I don't believe that also he went and did X after zip two so it's like oh if you you already had you know whatever the you know I don't know what he said I think like something like 60 or 80 million dollars out of zip two um like it'd be surprising to me if he was like you know what it's not gonna be enough I need to go get to 250 million that's the magic number yeah there's a big question about yeah like like should you ever sell a company because if if your real goal in life is to have an impact on the world maybe the company is the best way to do that and so you should just continue to run your company endlessly I mean you guys we everyone on this call sold companies well my goal is very simple yeah yeah what's your goal you said like if you want to have Maximum Impact on the world that is not my goal and so it's very easy for me to just be like oh cool I can rule that out I'm trying to have the best lifestyle that I could have that is my selfish and very transparent goal I am trying to improve my quality of life and with that comes my family's quality of life with that might come living in a good place and being being a happy content person walking around the world is my contribution to society I don't feel the obligation to go save the world but personally I mean the beauty of that is that like by you will naturally have a positive impact on the World by doing what you do to achieve those ends it might not be as big as oh you got us you cured cancer got us to Mars but like there's going to be economic activity that provides value and utility to various people as you like go about your business and as long as you have like a moral compass that doesn't that doesn't result in you doing something really unethical like you'll probably have a net positive view on society like my trainer has a great way of saying this he goes uh you know we I was like yeah my goal is to like have an amazing lifestyle quality of life right that's my my number one like you know why I do things is around that does this improve my quality of life oh if I go do this thing I'm stressed out all the time and I have meetings all the time and I don't see my kids no no you've it is not improved my quality of life but he said the other the other thing he said is mutually beneficial so that all the things I do are mutually beneficial to the people that interact with this if I make a product it needs to be mutually beneficial to them if I have a partner or I interact with somebody it needs to be mutually beneficial and so that's the only caveat that we added to it let's make it you know work is your personal trainer like your life coach do yeah oh yeah that's like a that's a recurring thing is Sean's personal trader John you uh you're cool because you um I think you're like us uh but maybe even more extreme in the tech world than that you have your foot in the startup world and you're hanging out with these bigwigs but you're also can just joke around and shoot the [ __ ] and like you're pretty self-aware who uh what do you align with who do you align with politically oh uh yeah I I really like this guy Mark Hurd who's a republican from Texas uh he was uh he's a smaller candidate so he's not pulling super well but he worked for the CIA and he also was on the board of palantir and he would be the first computer scientist president and I think that that would just be very very interesting to see someone with a CS background obviously I love programmers and I I think that they think about the world in very interesting ways and we've had this very long long Arc of you know lawyer lawyer businessman lawyer lawyer lawyer right like that's the story and he's like a younger guy so uh I'm I'm proud to endorse him are you more Republican than Democrat or do you vote both yeah yeah I vote both it just kind of depends on who is who can have like the highest impact on mostly technology and the business Community I think that those are kind of the the the things that we need to be thinking about I do think there's the interesting um as I look back on Trump I didn't vote for him didn't support him voted against him twice but um but I think that there's this weird situation where like the problems that Trump brought were obviously really bad I think you really like divided the country and just created a lot of chaos and I think that was like probably net negative for the United States but he did kind of get China right and he started this like he got people waking up about the fact that we are in a great power competition again and so you could see a world where the China situation dissipates and things get better and that would be phenomenal for the world and that's what I hope happens and in that case Trump will be remembered as like an idiot basically but the opposite could also happen where the China situation gets hotter and then people look back to Trump as like a like a genius who foresaw this all and like took the first steps to like make things safe and so I think the what's interesting is that though the way we remember presidents is often not by what they actually did but by how their decisions look in hindsight and it comes back to the you know don't judge Adventure investment until it's 20 years later 10 years later it's the same thing it's like like maybe we shouldn't judge our presidents until we you know with the full History of Time you had said something earlier about like you were working on natural language generation in 2013 yeah um now these large language model llms are all the rage and you had an idea around this that I liked because it was very different than how most people most investors talk about this so you had said something like everybody is uh knocking certain AI startups because they're oh it's just a wrapper on top of GPT it's just a wrapper on top of what open AI is doing it's a flimsy little thing you had a different take what's your take yeah my take is that that might be a reasonable critique for a growth stage venture capitalist to debate with their Partners at an investment committee meeting that is not necessarily what we should be putting out on Twitter x to the next generation of young Builders and if you are you know I I know a lot of these kids who are 17 18 19 and they're hacking and building chat GPT wrappers and some of them are making a ton of money and it's fine what's an example yeah I mean like an example would be like um like just just narrowing down to something very there are a few people that have done like uh like almost like dating coaching kind of like uh to help with if you're bad at texting there was a whole South Park episode about this which was pretty funny yeah yeah like if you're if you don't know what to text someone on like a dating app you can have like you could go to chatgpt and say hi I'm on Tinder and I I need to send a response to this girl and I'm feeling awkward like what should I say and it'll give you a recommendation but these apps have kind of like fine-tuned it to be a little bit more like spicy or you know engaging or whatever homework help they'll do rap lyrics they'll do whatever right yeah and I I don't I don't know the details about those but a lot of people will be like oh those aren't appropriate for Venture Capital therefore like they should not be built and this is kind of where I'm flip-flopping to my you know Lifestyles or bad it's like no actually these are phenomenal because we need these these like people to get experience building and I think maybe I think about it even less from the economic side and more from just the experiential side of like if if you ever talk to somebody who's like they were able to you know run some small business when they were in high school that's always a bull signal for entrepreneurship like there it's always like oh you're and now you're doing the Venture back thing it's going to make a lot of money like it doesn't matter what the thing was right it's like oh I was hustling sneakers or oh I was like selling reselling uh concert tickets like my thing was I bought DJ equipment in the United States and then I would export it to Australia and I was just like hustling that stuff in high school like everyone has one of these stories I'm sure you guys have tons that you've told on the Pod um but so so basically with the with the uh we need I want the lens uh for chat GPT moment so lenza for those of you who might not remember was I don't know what that is so so it's this app that you would download and you'd upload you know 10 selfies of yourself from your camera roll yeah and then it would generate AI images that looked like you so it would be like it that looks like Sam's face but it's on Superman or it was like but it was really like a Russian company that was that was the rumors that it was a Russian company I think that one was but yeah I mean there are some weird like these apps come from all over I'm not sure about lenza um I I think I don't I I just haven't looked into the company but and it made a bunch of money it was like number one in the app store for a bit yeah yeah it was based on it was based on stable diffusion which is this open source software package and dream Booth which was this paper that Google put out that then people went and implemented like no one knew what those things meant no one your aunt doesn't know what stable diffusion or lens or dream Booth is but she probably downloaded and paid for lenza magic avatars and had that as a profile picture for a little bit so it's just like this this fun viral moment that was really successful and I think that there's a lot of people who I would hate if they're toying around with chat GPT and they don't build something that's really fun and cool because they're like oh well this won't be like a hyperscaler combining like generational company it's like maybe you just need to go build the fun thing and put it out there and see how it goes what would be something you build so I have an idea about this which is basically that there's a few things that these that these systems are really good at you know obviously there's been huge progress in helping software developers program with GitHub co-pilot which is you know built by openai under the hood there's also you know just the Google use case like I go to chatgpt all the time just ask it questions that I would normally ask Google um people are doing a lot of like AI girlfriend stuff like you know shot I'm sure your your next uh your next big uh only fans investment will have an AI component probably but but I think that the that one of the interesting things that these language models are particularly good at is something called the Barnum effect have you guys heard about this no so the Barnum effect is this psychological phenomenon where like I can say a like something that sounds like it's very specifically tailored to you but it's actually vague and applies to everyone so so an example of this would be um Sam you have a great need for other people to like and admire you you have a tendency to be critical of yourself you have a great deal of unused capacity which you have not turned into your advantage like these things resonate with everyone they certainly resonate with me I feel like yep yep yep but and they feel personalized it's like astrology yeah yeah they use this in astrology and so what I'm thinking is like someone should take the you know chat GPT llms and make some sort of like viral personality quiz viral astrology app something along those lines that Miss Cleo yeah that X that exploits this effect that llms are really really good at and then and then uses it it's just like yeah you oh yeah did you get your personalities it's like did you get your lens of magic avatars like yeah I got them like I had to do in-app payment it was 5.99 it's like oh did you well did you get your custom personality test through this chat bot that's new and going viral like yeah sure I did that I think that's a great prediction I think that's gonna happen uh very soon and this we'll look back at this clip and be like dude he called it John called it that was gonna happen it has to happen uh somebody said this the other day they go um they showed me under they showed me a Steve Jobs clip and Steve Jobs goes once this technology happened um the there was a set of 20 things that were going to happen no matter what it didn't matter who was gonna do them they were going to happen a series of events were going to unfold once that breakthrough once that first breakthrough happened and you just didn't know when and you didn't know who but you definitely knew that they were going to happen that's how I feel about this idea I love it I'm glad I I'm glad I got the thumbs up on all my all my yeah your ideas were actually very very uh very solitary you you said you did your high school flipping thing uh you also were a uh uh what was it called like a phone a telephone marketing scam artist tell that story we'll wrap on that so this is a phenomenal story what do you like Workaholics uh yeah yeah a little bit I I use the office as a reference point because that is the the default like small business in America um you know they make a thing and then they ship it out and so the scam worked like this I found the job on Craigslist I show up and I'm wearing a suit I'm probably 17 years old or something and I'm like I brought a resume I want this job and they're like uh it's not that type of job like you do not need to be wearing a suit just sit over there you're going to call these numbers call down the list and when they pick up read this script and the script goes like something like this I probably still remember it by heart but um it was like uh when they pick up you do not ask how they're doing you do not talk to them you just say shipping Department please and you want to make it sound like you've been disconnected like I was already talking to the shipping Department half the time people are like what are you talking about this is a law firm we don't have a shipping department but the other half of the time people are like yeah we got a shipping Department I'll transfer you down there like you must have just gotten disconnected then you're down in the shipping department so imagine Dunder Mifflin from the office you know you just talked to Pam Pam transferred you down to I think Daryl is down in the shipping Department right and now you're talking to the guys down in the shipping department and uh the the scam was selling two inch clear tape so the guy picks up from the shipping department so the shipping Department you know John here uh or Daryl and and then you say hey you're you guys are still using the two inch clear tape right that was the line so this is the secret it's like it's like asking an office they use eight and a half by eleven inch paper or like asking you know a podcaster like do you still use microphones you know it's like yes everyone uses two inch clear tape in a shipping Department because what you use to just tape boxes it's a clear tape that you use to pack things packing tape and so they're obviously going to say yes but it sounds like you've already sold to them you know you're still using the two inch clear tape right we didn't say that we sold you but then then if they say yes then you say um you know hey I I just want to you know like thank you not for being a customer just thank you I want to thank you and we're going to send out I want to send out another box of that two inch clear tape uh for you guys and I'm gonna throw in a Starbucks gift card for you personally your name's gonna be on it this one's for you and I and and they're running me through this I'm like how much is the Starbucks gift card for I'm like uh I I need information I'm like obsessive about information and so he's like don't worry about it and I'm like no but like I need to know because like what if they ask me they'll never ask you and I was like no but I I have to know like I just I cannot do this job unless you tell me and he was finally like it's five dollars it's like wow so so they so they you know they do like the Starbucks gift card thing they get the guy to say you know yes I'd like you know I'm still using it send it out and then they send it out with an invoice so you don't need to collect the credit card details over the phone they send it out with the invoice and they've priced this clear tape at exactly the level that they think most accounting accounting departments will just stamp it so it was 500 for a box of clear tape and it costs them five dollars to produce this tape how much money did the company make millions I mean the guys were like driving around in sports cars like and I ran the numbers and it was like you know while I was there I only worked there for one day and then like I quit because I was like this is a scam I figured it out like almost immediately but a lot of people stuck around like you know but even then I think I think I sold a thousand dollars of clear tape and they're just trying to get the one sale and the conversion rate is insane yeah so so they send out I talked to the guys in our shipping Department of the scam and and and I first off hilarious the guys don't use their own clear tape because it just falls apart it just disintegrates it's like the worst product they buy the stuff that gets thrown away in China basically like like if they have manufacturing defects that's what they buy for like 10 cents and then they sell that for 500 which is already an order of magnitude more than you could just get from Staples are they are they still doing this scam I don't know I I don't think so they had like an F from the Better Business Bureau and then like I imagine that it like dissolved or they probably got like all their phone numbers blocked or something what did these guys look like did they look like what I think they would look like they actually looked exactly like the three of us yeah exactly I think I think the I think the CEO had your jacket sound he was wearing black teacher like you drive a black Escalade yeah yeah probably no I I think I think they were doing like Audi R8s I think that was like the big move there's some guy listening to this that's in a shipping Department that just had a holy [ __ ] moment he's like we've been dead the tape guy who keeps calling me those gift cards and then there's like and then there's like a thousand other people are like so how do I get the leads to the shipping company I'm in the same business now boys [Laughter] I I ran into a guy who'd worked there a year later and he was he came up to me I was at a concert and and he was like oh John like I Remember You The tall guy like how's it going I was like remind me where we know each other from he's like Delta shipping and I was like oh yeah I worked there for like a day like what's up like are you still there he's like no they fired me they fire everyone like every three months because they need to turn people over because as soon as one person finds out it's a scam they will tell everyone else it's the same thing with like a pyramid scheme or a Ponzi scheme like you gotta like extra you gotta like you know get out anyone who knows the truth and keep the blinders on everyone who's there because as soon as as soon as one person figures out they're gonna tell other people and be like don't you think it's kind of unethical what we're doing or don't you think this is like what if the police come like would we be in trouble you know and then that scares everyone and then the whole thing the whole well is poisoned so I'm like oh you got fired like that's I'm sorry man that's tough like what are you doing now hopefully you got like a better job he's like yeah I'm selling drugs at this concert good deal that's amazing you uh tell people what your YouTube channel is and also tell us why are you doing YouTube you could be going out there building another business but you're like us your create content so tell people what the channel is and why you do it yeah I mean basically just bored during the pandemic had always been I mean our first viral success at Soylent was you know content and content's super important for launching companies and I'm an entrepreneur so having a voice is very important in that equation um my YouTube channel you can find it just John Coogan's search there I also have a podcast now powerlaw.fm powerlaw hosted by John Coogan um not an interview show it's just kind of deep Dives on these power law people and companies these really good names and that's good titles that's a good idea yeah so it's it's interesting it's uh yeah it's a lot of fun I just I really like it and um yeah check it out and I I the biggest problem with it is that I don't have a lot of focus I'll talk about geopolitics my last video was on Doug jumuro like breaking down his business like I just I'm all over the place but uh but it's not much fun and like there's clearly value in what we do like people enjoy it makes them happy and you meet interesting people we got to have a great conversation because of it you know we appreciate you coming on this has been really fun you're uh you're cool man we we uh this has been awesome we appreciate it hey and we don't have a lot of focus either look we went from scams to who are you gonna vote for to guns you know this is I I this is like you your your audience you won't be perfectly optimized like oh we're like the best ever but in terms of the lifestyle like we all agree like this is the way to run the content machine don't don't go too crazy with it well thank you we appreciate it and uh thanks for coming on and that's the pod [Music] foreign

what do you have now 1.5 million subscribers 1.89 like your video setup is like almost janky although I feel like that's part of the shtick yeah it's quite unintentional the jankiness because I just don't know what I'm doing when it comes to videography and whatnot so every time I try and Spruce it up I fail miserably I imagine your businesses are doing tens of millions in Revenue I heard a rumor that you've moved to a really nice house and between your first apartment when you started and your second better apartment and your third nice house that you purposely make the background look exactly the same to the point of you took a wall from your first apartment into the third place is that true it is not a green screen I'll tell you that so a lot of people wonder if it is a green screen it's not that did not sound like a real wall a lot of people use it in their Zoom calls now apparently which is crazy they've like pulled the background out but yeah it's been the same background for a while it may or may not be a sauna you know that's the prevalent rumor as well but um I think it's a secret that's gonna live and die with the channel

you you like violate this rule that I have for myself and uh you you do it so wonderfully which is focus or at least it appears as as you do you like launch like I don't know how many companies a year do you launch eight eight goddamn [Music] all right we're live Kevin do you this is Kevin Ryan do you remember me I don't remember where we met I know we've met but I don't remember where that's good okay you don't have to remember so basically I'm gonna tell you why this is funny so basically I've studied you for maybe 10 years so you started uh you were the president of uh and CEO of doubleclick which had like a billion dollar plus exit and then you have started like four or five companies that are one's worth I think 28 billion today one's worth uh uh you have a couple billion dollar exits but you started Business Insider and I cold emailed you maybe 50 times and one of those times because I admired you so much and we'll talk about your career but I wanted to be like you and one of those emails you finally replied and you just said like thanks for the updates whatever and then I lied and I said I'm gonna be in New York tomorrow can I get 20 minutes of your time and you let me do that and I came to your office for literally 20 or 30 minutes we had such an impactful conversation and then you did another follow-up call with me and I have the notes from those calls and this was in 2007 team and you made a bunch of predictions about my life as well as the media business and a few other things that were 100 true and I refer back to that note sheet on a consistent basis to help make some decisions oh interesting I'm glad sometimes I get lucky and I get it right and you want to know what your your PR people cold email us to get you on the Pod so the tables have turned my friend welcome to my world but I just want to say like I've admired you for a long time you're you're a really big deal to me and so I'm so happy that we're able to like finally do this this is awesome and Kevin uh you don't know me but I I did not stalk you I did not cold email you in fact I was a little bit uh just jealous of you because I was at the time working in a um when Sam was telling me about you I was working at a startup incubator studio and so we were launching four or five companies a year and um after three or four years I was like I don't know if this model even works I just feel like it's like this because there's something inorganic about the studio model versus like just a normal startup that that comes from an entrepreneur solving their own niche and he's like well I don't know this guy Kevin Ryan seems to do it he's cranked out four or five billion dollar companies out of this and I was like I guess I should shut up and uh just you know not the model that's the problem it's me uh so you know I I think not only is it cool that you built Big media companies it's cool that you made the stuff the studio model work when very few people have been able to do that yeah no no I still enjoy it uh by and large it's still working you know things go wrong it's not I wouldn't say it's easy but we have a lot of companies that are doing really well in different sectors and so that's what's so fun and look there there are more things to be done there are many problems in society that have not been solved and basically the high level story of you is you uh you had like a normal corporate career but then you kind of like worked your way into uh double click which eventually I think became AdWords at Google exactly right yeah so Google bought it for about three billion dollars in 2007. uh the company started in 1996. I was there for nine years it was public for seven years first four year years went from 10 people when I joined to 2000 we're so crazy in 25 countries so that's why I said my early 30s doing um then we spent three years bringing back to a thousand people as the internet collapsed and 70 percent of our clients went bankrupt so don't do that uh then we we had huge market share controlled basically ad technology and so then Google bought it and then I started uh Business Insider you know [ __ ] and guilt I want to point one thing out in this journey by the way your career starts at Prudential uh so shout out to all the listeners out there who are in boring companies right now boring huge companies consultants and bankers out there there's hope for you yet um so you did like Prudential Euro Disney blah blah and then you join double click as employee 20 but you you they brought you in I guess as a senior person at the time yeah yeah what happened is I had launched an internet website four ew scripts which is a media company and I was the CEO and CFO of a division of that company wasn't it basically just like Gilbert Comics or exactly yeah Gilbert comics and we had other Comics we owned peanuts and a lot of other ones but on a relative basis it became very successful as a website we sold advertising uh e-commerce uh so things that were not that easy to do because we didn't have the vendors at the time so I went to the parent company and said look we should build up an internet Division and they said no because I thought you know I actually believe that the internet's going to be a huge which is obvious now but you know a huge part of the next 25 years I want to go do this full-time so I was gonna go start a company I ran across doubleclick that was already in the ad Tech space they convinced me to join them instead of starting my own company I became the the CFO the president and then the CEO and then when we met you basically you you kind of outlined after selling double click you said basically my partner Dwight and I we came up with this thing where we called it alley Corp and we're like you we get like two or three maybe even one good idea a year and then we find good people and we give them three hundred thousand dollars and we say you have six months let's see if we can make this work together and you did that with Insider Business Insider which I think had a 500 million dollar exit you did it with Zola which is still running and it's kicking ass I believe you did it with with Gil yeah which I think got to like 500 million in sales but it didn't end up working out wonderfully I think you said yeah when we sold for 250 million which was less than we thought but it's still obviously a you know a real number good yeah great and then you you can go ahead and correct me but you've done this with like four or five companies I remember this meeting from 2018 I said 300 000. that was wrong right yeah so we started each company with a million dollars so 500 000 from each one of us and that was for Guilt Business Insider and [ __ ] uh and then we I did after that Dwight semi retired and so I did that with Nomad I did that with Zola and now by now I put about a million and a half dollars in each company when we start them which isn't a significant amount of money for how big I mean mongodb right now is trading I think I think it's market cap is 26 billion dollars today I'm sure it's at covet Peak it was like 40 or 50. that's not a lot of money for the outcomes no no and hey look we had to raise a lot of money I mean [ __ ] between being a private and public company raised and lost a billion dollars before they had a profitable quarter and now already make 300 million dollars a year in profits so that's why it's so valuable is because it's a it's just an incredible copy growing quickly enormous market share and is going to grow for the next 10 years it'll be a 50 billion dollar company well you told me in our call you said one of my notes is basically if you're not hiring fast enough and and by the way this is like this is the VC route but you said if you're not if you're not hiring fast enough and losing money AKA investing you either haven't figured it out or you don't believe that your idea is good enough um and so you need to go grow faster well anybody you you don't want to grow fast just to grow fast if you have a good idea and if you're hiring a salesperson who costs 150 000 and they're selling 500 000 worth you need to hire those people all day long because you have an opportunity and if you have other products to create you should hire these Engineers to to build it so again it's not spending money to spend money but if you're building a big company it's going to take eventually a thousand people or two thousand people to do a billion dollars in Revenue well and your analogy was you go look if I if my idea is good enough I'm going to build a machine that turns one dollar into two dollars and if I have that machine what are you gonna do you're gonna go get as much money as you can and back that truck up into that machine and dump it in there exactly now there are times in various companies where it doesn't make sense to invest a lot more money because we're not getting the return yeah you run out of market share uh it's not as big a market as you think something's not working as well and so then the right thing to do is to not invest and I have companies right now that we've cut 30 of the people in the last year because given this market and what they were doing we had too many people so there's also a note in that call that I thought was really useful so I'm looking at Sam's notes from your cold like back in 2016 Sam's building the hustle he's trying to figure out what to do next I I assume you were considering raising money because you wrote this down and I thought it was uh um it's obvious when you hear it but I most entrepreneurs I don't think think this way which is you said let's say you're going to raise two million dollars at a 20 million evaluation so you're going to dilute 10 percent and you're saying you just have to ask yourself if I took that two million dollars and I invested it into growth people whatever over the next 18 months is our company going to be worth more than 10 versus if we do not and if it is then I need to do that I should do that trade and if it's not I should not and uh to capture the the logic properly there yeah no exactly that's what you have to look at and you know you don't you don't want to raise too much in that round because if you sold 10 million then that's very expensive Capital if you think it's going to be worth 100 million dollars someday or 200 million dollars you should raise that money later but you do need to get moving and time is never on your side you know any good idea I've come up with eventually even if it was six months later three other people are going to come up with the same idea so you need to move quickly people tend to they people most people understand the the risk of doing something they understate the risk of not doing something can you tell us a story where moving fast either benefited you or cost you big in one of these races that you ran absolutely so double is the perfect example we expanded to 25 countries before our first country was profitable so if we were a big company everyone would have said look let's wait and see and make sure our model works but the result was if you were Procter and Gamble or caterpillar or IBM who did you work with you worked with us because we had operations in 25 countries and you have off offices in those countries you didn't work with our competitor who had offices in six countries as a result we swept the market we lost a bunch of money but we were able to fund it and that is the reason today 25 years later that you know uh Google still hasn't commanding shares because we got it early on and it's never been given up but you're taking a chance I mean there are times when you invest in something and it doesn't work that well and you're like wow we should have waited you don't have time to wait what Insight was Insider Business Insider was that so you sold double click you back then when you and I met you actually told me how much money you made off the doubleclick sale I won't say it unless you want to say it but did you um which I thought it was amazing that you told me this I was like damn this guy's helping me out so much by telling me all this information did you you and Dwight get together to start I don't know if you call it an incubator or whatever you call Alley Corp but did you was Insider the first idea that you had and what led to that what led to the insight to start that yeah so The Insider idea was so simple that you can't even give us credit for it so this is 2007. I love business Publications and media Publications so I I'm sort of a compulsive reader of that and I didn't have the publication I wanted and it's so hard to to remember for people today that the Wall Street Journal and business week at the time did not basically did not update their websites during the day that's crazy are you thinking that's impossible and the reason is that they were still on that schedule of the paper comes out the night you know the the morning articles have to be done late at night and so at 10 and 10 a.m no one's updating it yet and so they just did not adapt it and don't forget uh your wheelie got mobile phones in 2008 and so then all of a sudden all day long you're in the taxi of course you want to get an update on what's Happening so we the things we did are so obvious and done today but they were we were early which is updating things continually writing stories that were not complete in a way we'd hear a rumor that X company was buying white company we'd say that's what we're hearing and you know what happens when you write that someone from that company calls this yeah actually it's true um and so then you get more information and so you maybe write four or five stories during the day as you get more and more information and we also had a point of view so you know we'd write uh so and so just overpaid for a company it's more important that we have a smart point of view than that we're right in the long term and so and we did a great job of making sure we showed up in search results so again everyone does that today at the time no one cared about headlines because if you had Business Week Magazine does the headline result in more revenue for you no but when we we would a B test three headlines very quickly on a story and realize what was working and so you know what I'm proudest of is that Business Insider is at 300 million uniques today and never spent one dollar in advertising yeah you told me well you said you you said we were just we were gonna just turn out these articles which um is common now but you go you had this really cool Insight you go it's kind of like Honda in 1985 versus General Motors Americans laughed at the Honda uh car they said this is just too flimsy this isn't good but they're gonna like capture some market share and they're going to improve and you said it's kind of like that with Business Insider the the the quote the critics or the the real people in the industry whatever you want to call them they laughed at you and they said this is just low quality this is junk and you're like but we're gonna get more traffic than you and I think it took like five years or something but we got more traffic than Wall Street Journal and now they're looking at us like holy crap you surpassed us and we could afford to have more substantial journalism that maybe is taken more seriously if if that's even uh I would guess by 2015 we had seven people covering military and defense that's deep coverage I mean you you you have a lot you're writing great stuff in the beginning obviously we had you know five journalists covering the whole world it's not going to be amazing but that that is a good parallel and we the product didn't get better over time we started winning Awards uh but it always was intended to be a different positioning it was punchier it appealed to younger people uh it was opinionated you know it was just a different product uh but I think I think the company you know we Henry Blodgett who's still the CEO has done an extraordinary job in over 15 years and a lot of these insights came from him he was one of seven people I interviewed for that job and he killed it uh what'd you see in him that uh made you pick him yeah I knew if you remember it was a bold choice because Henry had had some issues on Wall Street um so we some people felt like he was tainted I knew that in the the issues by the way were I think he got accused of was it insider trading at all what happened was at the time it was standard there was that the Wall Street analyst would come pitch the company that was going to go public and they would say look we're going to Great write great things about you which is potentially a conflict with their recommendations to their uh their their companies their investors so um everyone did that Henry actually wrote internal emails saying I feel really uncomfortable with this which then was used against him you know no one else did that and so legally I don't think he did anything wrong uh I everything he wrote was approved by his superiors and and order but anyway uh you know some people felt like he was tainted I didn't at all um what I did know is he was an incredible writer and he was a perceptive journalist he was writing pieces for the Atlantic I mean he's just so good I mean he's so talented and he also he truly understood internet journalism so the people I interviewed for the Wall Street Journal basically just wanted to redo the Wall Street Journal and which we don't need uh Henry had was was fresh he had never really worked in a newsroom which could be viewed as a weakness I've eaten it as a strength and so he changed the rules and we were willing to do that and he did an incredible job you know that same strategy of kind of like start with the content quickly that gets traffic don't try to be don't look for kind of like the peer Acclaim in the industry look for what the market wants and then over time improve the quality that was also BuzzFeed strategy but today I'm looking at the BuzzFeed stock it's 36 Cents it's a 50 million dollar market cap what do you think they got wrong or what happened to BuzzFeed because it seemed like they were they had that whole that same Playbook and Jonah pretty if you ever hear him talk he seems like you know whip smart in the same way for me it's very clear and I felt this from day one even when they were theoretically worth two billion dollars I rarely ran into someone who said I love reading BuzzFeed every day I I don't believe they built up a true brain they showed up in search results they got traffic but there were many many people that religiously read Business Insider every single day so it just had a brand that I think was much stronger and more defined and you you guys have another uh funny part about you which is I was telling my wife this because we were talking I was telling her I was going to talk to you and I was gonna and I followed Dave Portnoy on Twitter from Barstool Business Insider is the only one to get one up on him so you guys had this you guys had this article about some some stuff that he had done and he went ape [ __ ] he went crazy and Business Insider had the best response which was no response you guys didn't reply to anything and it's the only time I've ever seen Dave Portnoy get one up uh I wasn't really involved with that whole exchange that happened after and I we sold the company so well I thought it was pretty funny and I uh I thought it was I thought business that are actually handled it wonderfully and they were the first people that I saw that got one over on him you know you know Kevin um you you guys have had so many hits come out of the studio and um as somebody who ran a studio for six years and uh did not have billion dollar Hits come out of it I gotta know what's the uh what's the secret what you know what was it that you guys were doing differently and I'm sure you've talked to many other people you've seen many entrepreneurs start these labs and you've probably seen the same results that I have which is that very very few come up with anything that works what do you think you guys did differently than others so it's not that you know detail-wise we did anything differently at the end of the day this is a simple business but hard to do in other words you need a good idea and you need a good team uh so that's just there's nothing else uh so you know we've had some good ideas uh we do a lot of research you know any one time we're doing deep dive so someone will spend two and a half months interviewing 50 people doing the same thing that I would do if I were an entrepreneur about to start a company so we have a lot of knowledge there's a 50 page DAC we've really gone into it and then we're committed and then we go hire a great team and we help that team but again it's a little bit like watching you know I don't know a good basketball player a good soccer player we know what they do we can see what they do can I do what they're doing not very easily so I think we've executed well there yeah I mean you know we have a bunch of people including myself have a lot of experience doing this it's just a series of judgment calls you know I think uh I'm able because the track record and able to convince some good people to be CEOs um that's important too and we you know we spend a lot of time helping them so I chair 12 companies so about half my time is spent focusing on those 12 which are 12 of our most valuable companies uh to really guide them and make sure that they do as well as possible walk us through like one of those ideas so okay so here for example two and a half years ago so I'm uh I'm very interested in psychedelics or mental health I'm the leading funder of the Yale Center for psychedelic research you know I'm involved with a bunch of things non-profit research for you know pushing psychedelics forward so they can be legalized either by by the FDA or by state so with that context two and a half years ago I said let's do a deep dive and see if we come up with a for-profit idea the first on my team works with me interviews 50 people yeah we're talking to everyone and we come up with a solution that was partly influenced by some of the work that's been done at Yale and we start a company called transcend the person on my team actually which is unusual spins out to become the CEO uh Blake Mandel big article in uh the Wall Street Journal about five months ago about transcend because we we started off with a million half dollars but we raise 40 million dollars about a year to a year and a half later in two tranches at 80 million free so big big big big step up big valuation and we have a compound that you haven't heard of going through the FDA process it's in phase two trials right now uh and so people are obviously optimistic about the future like the team like the execution uh we did some things very well there we have been awarded patents for example you follow this industry you know that you can't patent MDMA or mushrooms because those have been around for a long time but we actually did get a patent for meth alone which is the compound that we're working on uh so so far so good now there's still risk but that company is you know we currently have a 50 million dollar position based on our 5 million that we've invested so far and we think it has a lot of potential what about um like with mongodb so um that was started I think in 2007 so Ali Corp was like a little bit early did you have a team helping you research ideas back then I didn't that was purely Dwight myself and Elliot Horowitz who was the most brilliant young engineer at doubleclick now out of 700 Engineers if you could pick out one person other than Dwight you would have picked him and so we started a company together in 2005 called shop Wiki which is a search engine for shopping did okay not great we sold it in 2007 made a little bit of money and then said what are we gonna do next and so came up with this idea uh started working on it it was a very hard slog it's very easy to feel good about it right now for three years we had zero Revenue so not easy to keep funding going back to VCS with zero rubber but we had a lot of people using it so you know we broke through that but we had some ugly financing rounds you know especially back in 2009 2010 that was not a good time to be raising with no revenues uh then finally Sequoia came in and then we raised a lot of money and now it does getting close to a two billion dollar run rate did that company make you a billionaire so yeah I mean look for all of us it definitely uh yeah we all made lots of money on that on that company definitely those three years with no Revenue uh at the time were you like people just don't understand that this thing is uh like others don't see it but I see it or were you like in the fog of War you're like I don't know if this was a thing if this is gonna make it but um you know let's keep going no no I would say that all of us were nervous because uh yeah you like to have Revenue when you're gonna run out of money at some point what helped us on the inside was that uh the utilization the number of people using the product it was free was growing every single month all over the world so there's you know probably 50 000 small companies using the product and so you know there were hundreds of meetups about [ __ ] and people were showing up and we can see in a way that the dogs like the dog food uh we just needed to then make it good enough that larger companies would pay money for it and then we got there and and the rest is history but what's crazy is like all right Business Insider I understand that well that's media I get it perfectly guilt that's Commerce that's fairly easy to understand Zola the kind of media-ish related but like I feel like I understand that business and then you have like psychedelics which I don't have anything about but then [ __ ] is like highly technical I I I barely I don't I I don't even know the use case to be honest it's a database company it involves SQL like I don't even I'm so not technical it's pretty amazing that like are you are you pretty I mean you are now but were you well versed on what this idea was or did you just trust Elliot so Ellie and Dwight you know were the brains and the technical jobs like the product could not have been built without them Ani understood the high level problem which I saw which is that Oracle was not the right database for the future because we were going from structured data to unstructured data it's the way to think of that is that if I you know you think of a spreadsheet which is how we all thought about data but if I told you I have 10 000 videos can you put that into your spreadsheet and you're like well no actually it's not built for that but of course data was moving that way YouTube came out in 2005 video was gonna be enormous uh so I knew that Trend was happening I knew that the Oracle product was extraordinarily expensive for us and so there had to be a cheaper way we had seen Linux come out so that was an open source you know operating system that was enormously successful and so we thought collectively that we needed an open source database that uh was was structured for the future and so that was the bad so that I understand if you said five levels down do I understand the code no but you know I was working anytime you start a company you know like I'm not a particularly good writer Henry is uh and he was in charge of that product I knew the market well enough in both cases high level and then it's about assembling the team you got to think of yourself as you're the coach you are not the player and if you're a coach and if you managed to persuade you know LeBron James and Kevin Garnett and a bunch of people on your team your team's gonna do well that's actually the job you um you like with the when you're talking about transcend and you're like we've got a drug going through FDA trials I had the same reactions I think Sam's having which is like man this guy's pretty Fearless like goes into totally different spaces with totally different business models and um with probably a whole bunch of like new things you got to learn um and even if you're the coach you know you're betting money and you need to be able to recruit the right players and you need to steer the ship um do you feel like fearlessness is something you have and do you do you notice that like do you feel like sometimes I look at other entrepreneurs and I think man I can't believe that more of them are not doing X do you feel like that about the way you approach entrepreneurship like I don't know I feel like more people should be trying they're thinking this way but they don't seem to I mean look what we do is just a slight variation of an entrepreneur they just happen to have entrepreneurs working for me and we have a structure and and don't forget we also have you know I have 70 Engineers who work for me I have my own in-house outsourced engineering company which helps us build product now very quickly which we've had the last three years uh I own a big chunk of a search firm 10 person executive Search firm that we set up so that we can get some of the best talent working for us finding CEOs so we've built infrastructure around it but still most of it goes back to a good idea and uh a good T and when we get that right yes and by the way last one on psyched out yeah I had done plenty of work I mean I'm not a scientist but I've gone through the academic papers I know the state of research inside Alex I know it's working and look what I am thinking about all the time and everyone here does is where is the world going to be in 10 years that's the North Star for what we're doing if something's going to happen next year it's too late I need to bet on a 10-year Trend so you know we do a bunch of things in robotics and automation because I feel good about that Trend it's like you know this is a 10-year Trend mongodb was a 10-year friend um these are things we were betting on what are you consuming on a daily basis to spot these Trends yeah so tons of things no one thing I'm on you know many many newsletters that are industry focused or general focused or science or is I I read 40 books a year I'm in conversations with people all the time where you're you know there's a lot of learning uh and then people on my team are more specialized than I am so you know I have two MD mbas who are head up our Healthcare practice and then people below them that have worked in healthcare so they're thinking of very specific issues that I probably wouldn't wouldn't think of and the same is drive a person on Marketplace is the person on semiconductors and Material Science and a person on developer tools and enterprise software and two people on social impact so a lot of what we do is in those areas and I'm a bigger and bigger believer now of Industry Focus you know it's a you know you and I are not going to think of something that applies to the chemical industry right now but if that's all you did for six months and interviewed 100 people you'd probably come up with some ideas that make sense and the industries that you care about right now are Health Healthcare uh uh it definitely uh then the ones I mentioned so semiconductor is a material science developer tools uh with some security marketplaces B2B marketplaces uh social impact and Robotics and automation what's an example of a B2B Marketplace that you're interested in yeah so we invest we have done a deep dive into the maritime industry so shipping no one thinks about it multi 100 billion dollars very behind in technology we invested in a company called box Hub that's a Marketplace for those containers that are in container ships based in Toronto uh most people wouldn't have known about it we LED that round we also have just started a company in Maritime that's going to be a a procurement Marketplace so you're a ship let's say you're arriving in Cartagena your boiler breaks what are you gonna do yeah you weren't planning on that and so having a site you can go to that becomes sort of the Amazon of that and as delivery and can get you those parts uh everyone in the industry told us that that's needed so we're literally just built the team two months ago there are probably at four people right now and so we're off and running what's that company called it doesn't have its official name yet so all right let's use that as an example so you basically did uh did you just go and somehow Network your way into talking to 50 oh yeah so a woman on my team uh absolutely did that and went to two uh Maritime conferences so which she said were fascinating it's basically people from Venezuela you know the Middle East Russia you know from all over the world Greek and so trying to understand the industry just about the Pirates hobble it around and a bunch of parents that bird [ __ ] all over the place she said it did not look like her Princeton uh reunion at all so yeah and so and she met with the couple investors who invest in this space you know ship owners uh data providers everyone you're just trying to understand how does this industry work and I think there's an advantage sometimes coming from outside because some people just say oh that's just how it works here and the person on the outside will be like wait a second it doesn't have to work that way you know we can do better right and that's why like you know Henry was the perfect person coming from outside you know when I started guilt none of my initial five people had worked in the fashion industry but we understood the problem it wasn't that complicated so we could create something that was that was interesting and unusual uh so that's the right approach we just started a company in assisted fertility I'm sure you guys know you have friends you know who are getting IVF I did it yeah my brother and his Husband you know uh had a child through surrogacy freezing eggs that's gonna grow for the next 10 years for all the reasons we know about people having children later sperm counts are down much things so we do we saw we started copy what uh four months ago we put in a million half dollars and we just signed a term sheet to raise you know five and a half million dollars um a lot of people wanted to do it people are excited about the team uh we have you know good set of people uh mostly from Stanford Business School on this team and it's a big space so uh I'm gonna bet on that team and that trend for a while what does that deck look like you said they they do like a or maybe I think a 50 page memo or deck I'm not sure what you said do you have a structure for it yeah it's generally one just talking about the industry where are the problems where are the pain points and then where are the opportunities what's the product idea so one of the reasons I do almost nothing in e-commerce these days is because I don't see the problem we saw the industry solve the problem I mean if you name anything on the planet Earth just about you know you can find a site they'll have ten thousand of them it'll be sent to your house by tomorrow man I don't know how to do better that problem is solved whereas when I yeah when I started guilt you actually couldn't get Marc Jacobs at 50 off online uh just no one offered it and so we offered it and people went crazy over that uh so e-commerce is very mature frankly media is pretty mature right now there's a lot you know nothing people say to me I just can't find what I want to want to read uh but even you know once in a while we're working on one idea right now the early stages in the media space uh but not not sure yet so we're looking for problems the health one of the reasons I like healthcare is because it Healthcare is not solved you know as you guys know you have knee surgery either you or your insurance company are going to pay a crazy amount one there's too much knee surgery it's gonna someone's gonna pay 40 000 yet in France it's 20 000 and the results are better so can it be done better yes it can be done better you're 20 times more black women die in childbirth than in Sweden yes is that something that is just inherent and is always going to happen no we don't do enough prevention there are many structural issues in health care that have not been solved and we're we're solving some of them our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better it sounds to me like what you do is you look think about what's the world going to look like in 10 years um yeah you know either what's a problem that just if somebody could solve it that would be a major major unlock or hey the puck is going this way and then then it sounds like you say um cool let's go find out everything we can learn about that space we we go in kind of uh open-minded about what problem we're gonna solve we try to figure out uh where all the pain points are and then it sounds like you're looking for what I'll call the big obvious problem which is if it's too complicated and nuanced it doesn't sound like you're that interested it's like uh hey you can't find luxury fashion online for 50 off right okay that's like a big obvious problem it doesn't take that much explaining or expertise to even understand the problem maybe the solution might be might take some expertise but the problem should be in your face uh once once you're looking in that industry um we uh we have this thing we say on the podcast which is that there are businesses that their business plans that are what I call one chart businesses you could just look at one chart and it just tells you oh that's yep that's so obvious like we were looking at one that was around um uh in the death space around cremation it was like cremation went from I don't know seven percent of all things to like 50 it's now the majority of uh of of of what choices people make when um when it comes to a funeral and this is like that's a one-chart business you can look at nothing else and say all right I know there's big I know there's opportunity when I look at a chart like this um is is that does that jive with your way of thinking or do you have anything you can add to our understanding of that no no absolutely I mean I'll give you another one the cost of Labor is going to just keep going up and so you know waiters were paid 15 an hour now it's 20 to 25 an hour in New York unless we change immigration or something funnily change is that could be thirty dollars an hour so you know what over time that changes the calculus of automation whether it's making french fries whether it's through this we're all going to have to find ways to use less Labor uh and so when cost of tech goes down and the cost of Labor goes up what does that tell you more automation is going to happen uh so I'll bet on that Trend all day long yeah we're an investor in a company that gives robotic massages there's a 17 000 open positions for massage therapists in this country and so you know there's hotels that just can't offer massages because they don't have the people so you know we hope they're going to offer a massage so that's just one example but I have 10 others we uh well what are those 10 others uh of just of just automation or other ideas no just I'll give you another example another company we invested in is so driverless cars is you know as you know not legal in most countries most States but having a remote driver is so would you if you're in New York City would you pay money to have a car a rental car brought to your apartment as opposed to you having to take your seven suitcases and two kids and go to the rental car of course you would um and yet we can have someone in the Philippines or in you know Arizona drive the car because we put software and Hardware in the in the car they can see everything that's legal in many states uh Airport's already talking to us uh about um the vans that they have to drive around to bring people to the rental car lots at two in the morning hardly anyone on there you got to pay someone double time 40 bucks an hour that should be done by someone remotely so things like that are going to be automated so Sean and I um we've had a bunch of cool people on this podcast so one of our great friends is this guy named Andrew Wilkinson he owns maybe 40 companies a lot of agencies and web stuff mostly bootstrapped it's publicly traded now and then we had this other guy named Saeed who's like 32 years old who owns um a bunch of Wordpress plugins basically that bootstrapped a unicorn wow amazing and well of what she owns most of um and so we have a lot of like and and I fall in this category as well I I bootstrap a lot of my things um and then there's this other category so there's a category people who like bootstrap stuff and then she's their cash flow and then oftentimes that same group of people prefer to go and buy companies as opposed to build them from scratch you're taking the opposite approach a little bit where you're like uh I'm gonna fund it it's not gonna make money at first but I and I might go and raise a a [ __ ] ton more money but this might be a huge idea and I'll own a small piece of it what um like have you ever considered the bootstrapping model or is your is your you just go big right away and have you ever considered buying what's your like buy versus build kind of mindset yeah so it really depends on the type of business so if you're running an agency you just don't need a lot of capital you know you hire five people who uh and then they that agencies make money and then you use that money to reinvest and grow if you're building what I'm building is closer to like a hotel you know you have to build the whole building before anyone comes and stays with you so a little different because like [ __ ] you got to take years to build a good enough product and there's no way to bootstrap that you know it takes 2050 you know there's a hundred million dollars generally for those types of companies to get there so that's why it's it's not an option for those things look I would love to have companies that you know I that own all of for example the the agency that I have I said those Engineers I basically have an outsourced engineering company I own all of that uh because it has clients and it bills as it gets more clients like those visits are not a scalable profit margins are generally lower um those are not typing businesses I generally go after why is that is it just a matter of you just enjoy something more do you think that one is a better better wealth creation are you I mean what's the motivation I just prefer creating a product a real product that's hard uh and then you know making more scalable and building it up over time the vast majority of quite successful companies are in that category the services oriented companies you know it's harder it's harder to get to be a unicorn it can happen but there aren't there aren't that many over time gotten more selective on the project selection because I look at you know you did Business Insider I think you were the C were you the CEO for like a period of time there nine years is that right no no I was the chairman for all nine years I did step in I did step in to be the CEO of guilt when we were growing really quickly I just decided that I was the right person at that point for probably two or three years but otherwise I've been chairman of many companies for 15 years I stepped into [ __ ] I changed CEOs about eight years ago uh and for three months I was de facto the CEO as I was doing so you've run these for period of time but mostly not um but but I guess uh when I think about businesses I look at my career and it's like I look back and I think okay of these 10 things I did two of them were like ate up all of my time and gave me a bunch of gray hair for like relatively less payoff versus these other two which was like I just kind of wrote the check it was an obvious opportunity and it just paid me and it was wonderful have you like what's the best business that you've done in your portfolio that you look back on that has the combination of the value the pain that it took to get there you know um all of that and then do you have a framework around there or do you think it's just luck at the draw and he's like the draw I mean [ __ ] is the one where you know I got the most return for the least amount of money I mean I essentially never worked there full time uh so chairman for 13 years um and yet it's super valuable and you know fascinating company that's going to be around for the next 50 years uh but you know I'm intellectually curious so what I love about what I do is that you know in an hour I might be in a meeting on psychedelics and then on you know semiconductors and I have to try and keep up and learn something about these um and that's what so you know we have one in cardiology uh there's so many different things it's that's what's amazing and for someone who's thinking about 10 years I'm a little surprise I don't see AI all over this doc uh you know you're not saying it sounds like it might be embedded in some of these things that you're doing uh like might be a tool you use but are you bearish on it for some reason or what's your thinking around AI no I say two things one it's coming down now but if it were six months ago you know the pricing on AI was insane now three people walk in and say we're worth 100 million dollars because we're gonna put together an AI company just didn't make sense so we didn't make any direct Investments there um each we're really encouraging each one of our companies to use Ai and I think them you know the really use of AI in the short term is going to be much more mundane it's optimizing customer support you know making your coding more efficient and things like that uh we're a long ways before you know true AI companies are coming but it's but it's on its way we did something unusual this summer The our entire technology team shut down for a week went home and their only assignment was to learn about AI the entire week read about it think about it talk to people John did that too yeah I did the same thing I shut down for a week yeah just to get up to speed because it is a very important thing that we all need to be thinking about and then came back you know compared notes and made sure that our our companies are thinking did you do it too or just the engineers no these are not Engineers this is the the investment people on the on the tech side so I do it on a more continual basis you know I'm spread thinner than other people so you know I have 60 board meetings a year I have a lot of things I have to I can't shut down as easily unless I'm a burning man in Orange yeah as one does nice Flex I love that then I'm done then I'm off the grid and I don't have a choice I'm going to change all of my uh my my uh auto reply things to I'm in Antarctica even though I'm just actually in time the only two times I'm truly off to it you uh you you like violate this rule that I have for myself and uh you you do it so wonderfully which is focus or at least it appears as as you do you like launch like I don't know how many companies a year do you launch eight eight goddamn and you could do eight now but I don't know how big your team was early on but it seemed like you were still creating a lot of companies I mean generally it was one a year one a year um there was that one year we did three between the two of us uh but I would never be able to do eight on my own I mean they take real time if we are if the roles were reverse you know I look up to you if you were a 23 year old and you looked up to me I would say man you got to do one thing well and that will pay more dividends I agree oh well great so what's your like opinion on that then no no so I think that anyone I I and people come to me all the time and say look I would like to have a studio like you and I'd say look don't do that start by trying to start a successful company and end up not being the CEO that's already not that easy you know if you have that and six months later the company has raised its external round of financing has a full management team in place and you are the chairman you can then decide to do another one you know you can't truly be CEO of multiple companies but you can be chairman of multiple companies but you got to start with one and you try and do two or three at the same time on your own it's not going to work it's not that easy you know I have 25 people what does the chairman actually do so a chairman is one the in this case is the ultimate person that's going to be around 15 years from now the CEO may change this is a person that's going to guide it and as a co-founder you know if along the way somehow Henry Lodge had quit that's my problem I need to find a CEO I need to solve that for the board so you're just the most active board member we had other investors but everyone knows the guy one company that is gonna have a tricky financing round and uh we need to get the in the uh the internal investors together not going to be easy I need to do that so I'm having calls with all them I need to Wrangle everyone encourage them push them come up with the right thing what type of relationship do you have with your CEOs like before it's like uh you know in the first one two three four years how often are you working with them yeah so I mean there uh we're gonna have a call probably every week or every two weeks soon to touch base and then they reach out if they need something I mean I love the relationship I feel great about the relationship because you know I don't want their job I wanted a job I would have I would have taken their job um I want them to succeed I don't you know I don't want to be CEO of one company and hopefully I can stay out of the way because they know much more about the company than I do but there's certain things where I have either relationship some experience tricky issues uh uh introduction to a VC firm where I can add value uh and so I I love that relationship uh I like you so much because you do things okay so Sean and I are in this like stupid Twitter world where like a lot of our friends are popular on the internet yeah and there's this whole thing that I don't buy into of like build in public and like use your audience but like it's people selling like 100 a month things or something like that and you have these like really big ideas but also like for how successful you are we take pride in like finding interesting people who are like amazing but not incredibly well known you are really good you're one of the higher people on this ratio of like pretty low-key under the radar but has had massive impact it's exactly what I want and like you don't have an audience like you you violate all these like stupid rules that people talk about I do no social media why is that you know it's I look I think other people use it very well and they like doing it I don't want to spend the time uh I don't want to do it I don't want to I don't need to be out there uh I that time should be used for thinking time and managing time uh and so yeah no the people are on my marketing team know that the goal is that we are very successful and that when I walk into a restaurant no one knows who I am yeah I mean I just think it's awesome well I I but you you're on like CNBC and [ __ ] like that every once in a while I'll see you there I think there's rumors that you're you're gonna run for mayor is that true so yeah choose everything one is you haven't seen me on TV in a long time right yeah that was you that was about four or five years ago I think I was like leaving your office or something like that in the Yahoo building or maybe I was at a friends I saw you on TV yeah I don't think I've been on for at least five years so yeah I don't yeah you know actually podcasts are the only thing I do because it's sort of enjoyable you don't need to prepare you have a good conversation uh so I've done that but I other than that I do almost nothing I did uh think about running for mayor you know eight years ago I've been very involved in politics in many ways um representing Tech Community and in every Dimension um all my life I thought I would want it that'd be the one other thing I'd want to do and then decided you know seven years ago that I didn't want to do that it's it's a miserable process you know if you said to me you could be mayor tomorrow I would actually do it and you said to me no no what I mean is that you can be one of seven candidates you can spend eight months getting the [ __ ] kicked out of you and being humiliated you're like uh I'm gonna be in Antarctica that week sorry guys like can we do this next week no we're not you're you're telling me I can't go see my kids who are you know at various points all over the world and I get to see them all the time uh we do great things together uh and so that's a big trade-off that I don't want to make anymore so I'm gonna keep doing what I'm doing for a long time you were involved in one company um that I always that I think could still work and it didn't work uh but you almost had it so you invested or were a board member you're heavily involved I think in hot jobs which they had an exit but you do this other one called uh the ladder or ladders yeah where at the this was in the mid 2000s where like a hundred thousand dollar job was considered good and it was like I think if I remember correctly I don't remember if the user paid or if the job company paid but it was a job board that's kind of dismissing it but it was a job site for a hundred thousand dollar jobs yep and I remember seeing that I was like that's pretty cool and I tried launching a company where the user would pay a subscription and then editorial person would try to survey and uh and effectively find out what it's like to work there as opposed to the company uh like telling you the best the best um like you know like the best stuff but I always you're always in you had a couple companies in like the job space I've always thought that that was pretty cool and I always thought that could have been done effectively I remember the was it ladders or the ladders the ladders and it's still around but not nearly as successful as it was it started in 2004 I was one of the early early investors uh and it's it's actually still there I lost you know LinkedIn basically you know did a much better job I'm an investor in Ripple match which is uh a jobs oriented company aiming at people in college the job situation is still not fully solved and that's going to be one where uh you know AI will be used intelligently as a recruiter as you know it takes enormous time to figure out the 50 resumes you should look at reach out and say can I have a phone conversation with you respond to that hours and hours and hours and hours and hours and that needs to be you know productized uh and we're on our way we being my company as well as many others has alicorp ever taken any financing or are you strictly using your winnings like and how much did you use to fund the company when you first started yeah I did hear that much but I yo I've invested probably 250 million dollars into the various companies over the years and that came from like the the various the sale yeah but but do you take cash flow from anything or is it strictly you yeah is your income lumpy or not your personal income but no I I don't I haven't gotten paid in a long time I'm purely just investing my own money but I have all infrastructure and a whole firm that does that so it's like it has historically been a single LP fund everyone has carry it's no different than you into our Ventures or Thrive or anything else just has one LP instead of many what are you looking to change or improve so if we talk to you 10 years from now what do you hope what do you hope is different about you or your lifestyle or your businesses that versus today so I'm doing most of the things I want to do now so one you know it's going very well results have been great I spend three to four months a year in Europe working from there I grew up in Europe my wife is French uh uh I have one child there uh and I I enjoy that so I'm planning on continuing that I want to keep doing various you know athletic and interesting trips around that that you know that that I enjoy so from a high level I'm not planning on changing it dramatically the I'd actually love what I'm doing I think we're having fun and we're going to continue to do this I don't want to make it much bigger you know I don't want to have that many more people that'll just make it more sort of system oriented where I'm not close to the companies because what I enjoy is when I'm close to the companies and the problems and that's where I think I I add value I'm just trading off I'm very old at this point in this industry and so I'm you know hopefully reaping the benefits of the Judgment that you get after dealing with these things and making lots of mistakes along the way but a bunch of things going well and another thing that I like about you is that um you're very emotionally stable like every time you know I've only talked to you three times but like you were quite logical and like you seem like a guy who isn't rattled and I read an article about Business Insider selling and I think uh the article said Henry Blodgett is a very emotional person which is makes sense because he's a journalist he's a great writer and during the sale I think someone was I think he was like I'm not even talking to Axel Springer whoever bought it uh Kevin has to do it yeah like I just I can't even be in that room yeah and like it was like all right Kevin steps in and he's the reasonable one or he's like the emotionally uh like I negotiated I negotiated the entire deal uh and you know and look I could not be a bigger fan than I am of Henry's but it would be like if if someone kidnapped your daughter uh are you a good negotiator with the other side and the answer is no right you're like give them everything uh yeah we can just get her back so we need someone else to do that and so um it was better for me to do it he was very nervous because I was pushing to get a higher price uh and but which we did you know we're doing 40 million at the time we sold it for 11 times revenues which is a big big number for a media property insane yeah it's insane we're good friends with uh one of our best friends is Austin Reef the founder of morning Brew yeah and and they're they're killing it for for bi and uh great that happened after me but great acquisition uh I still get that product every day I think they do a really nice job have a great editorial tone but you're right I'm I'm don't I mean this I think it's important to not get too emotional about any one company and that's one of the things I can bring to the table and when you're CEO you're just so close to it you're you're you're in the forest I can step back a little bit and sometimes say look you know this is gonna be bigger than you think and we should you know double down or it's not working and let's figure out a way to sell this it's easier for me a question that we uh that we like to ask people is like what do you do with your money so like if if you know of your of your pie chart of your 100 portfolio how do you how do you allocate uh to different stuff you know do you have public equities and just normal bonds and stuff are you all in on private company what are you doing all in on private companies so probably 90 of my net worth is just in my own Farm in investing in various companies and things uh I have a I have some in some VC and private Equity firms you know as an LP uh you know and I do have some real estate uh I bought a building a commercial real estate building uh between on Mott and Broome in between Soho and Bowery and so when you come visit in a year that'll be the alley Corp headquarters there'll be a restaurant in the in a in the in the retail floor five floors of commercial real estate and an amazing roof deck with parties for 150 people and dinners for 30 people up there so it's gonna be a real Tech Center so we're it was a shell of a building and construction starts in a week we've designed it over the last nine months it's a super fun project but it's also a diversification for me and owning some real estate but you don't have any Public public equities no other than I imagine you still own stock in uh uh mango yes but but like you don't you don't have any uh boring uh indexes really are you heavy on cash yes I always keep a lot of cash I need to keep a lot of cash because I don't have you know I don't have a salary so and I don't know when money's coming back where do you keep your cash just in the in the in yeah as simple as a high yield savings account yep yep exactly I need to be super liquid dude that's so fascinating this is awesome Evan thanks so much for coming on we uh as you can tell big fans and what you've done is is pretty incredible also I think there's just like what you do about thinking about where the world is going what ideas what opportunities what problems it's also you know the premise of our podcast when we don't have guests on that's all we're doing we're thinking about that and we're we're brainstorming what that could look like and so our entire audience is people who like hearing about those opportunities or stories of people capitalizing on them so I think this is uh you know very very good fit thanks for thanks for doing this great well thanks for having me on it's just fun and again good to reconnect and I hope you realize like I'm not just talking [ __ ] like you had a really big you you've had a big impact in my life and um I'm gonna be following a bunch of stuff that you do and and I have this document that I it's like uh 500 500 Words of the notes that I took and I talked to and I've and you actually predicted that how much we were going to get acquired for by the way you nailed it yeah you nailed it um you said I think in two years gonna get bought for about this much you nailed it uh you predict two other Acquisitions in the media space as well in my notes I'll share it with you so you see uh the notes but uh you've had a really big impact on me and it's really cool to talk to you and hopefully we can stay in touch yeah of course we it sounds like we need an in-person uh meeting uh we need to get together and and see what the next five years are going to look like let's do it man I would love that and and we appreciate you thanks for coming on all right thanks [Music] thank you

I don't know what you're doing per month but I would not be shocked if this was doing between six and eight million a month in Revenue blink twice if I'm right yeah you're uh you guys are pretty you know on point with your ballpark [Music] all right what's up we got Derek from more plays more dates here I think I made a fatal mistake before this podcast I don't know if you know this but um I was doing research last night I was like okay I got to be prepped gotta be ready to go I've been following you for a while but I said let me just make sure I I I button up here and I go to your subreddit r slash more plates more dates to be clear this is not like my subreddit I didn't start right but I didn't realize this at the time okay so I'm on this subreddit thinking it's your subreddit think of these are just polite civil faithful fans in fact it says there's 163 000 faithfuls that's how they call the members uh it is a top one percent uh subreddit so you're doing really well and I say hey I'm interviewing uh Derek Smart he's coming on a pod we're gonna hang out what should we talk about and I said you know give me some ideas hoping that this you know I did this like you know let's see a time of post was like 1am and I go to sleep and I wake up and I say oh let me just check that real quick maybe somebody had some really thoughtful questions here's the breakdown 98 of them want to know um how big your penis is that's the number one comment by far everybody said the same exact thing I don't know if that's an inside joke or you just have some really really eager fans uh and then the second was like bro you needed to know this is a trolling subreddit this is not a this is not the serious subreddit of like people trying to have a real conversation like you didn't you didn't know what you're giving yourself into and sure enough I did not the third comment was bring a ruler yes they're very creative I I can imagine uh what kind of stuff you got had an onslot of for sure there's a decent amount of trolling and uh I don't know just like posting that goes on there but there is some insightful stuff like I I'm a moderator on it I didn't start it but I do check in time to time and I've been pretty shocked how much it's ramped up like I don't know what I don't know what it is in size but it seems like this is a good one yeah so Derek what I've been watching you for years I remember watching you when you were doing like I think a cottage cheese or some type of like protein intake video and you look horrible because I I believe you are an amateur or maybe even more serious than amateur bodybuilder and you're like cutting and you looked just miserable when you were like really lean but you have all these uh amazing videos where originally it started out as like uh is this celebrity taking steroids but then it kind of like expanded beyond that to like you would actually do some really cool breakdowns about science the science behind different Fitness stuff but then also life advice and uh now you have like I think four different companies gorilla mine Merrick and a few others and so um we're interested in like definitely some Fitness stuff but also the fact that you're running like I think three or four uh like pretty successful businesses and what do you have now 1.5 million subscribers 1.8 yeah I think uh let's see 1.89 yeah yeah so you built like a pretty like what it appears to be monster businesses but you've done it like with some really high integrity it feels like and you've also uh like your video setup is like almost janky although I feel like that's part of the shtick uh but so it's just like all about like just really high quality content that is well researched yeah it's almost it's quite unintentional the jankiness because I just don't know what I'm doing when it comes to uh I don't know videography and whatnot so every time I try and Spruce it up it just uh I failed miserably so I just leave it the same but I've heard a rumor I've heard a rumor that you've gotten you know you've clearly have gotten quite successful I imagine your businesses are doing tens of millions in Revenue I heard a rumor that you've moved to a really nice house and between your first apartment when you started and your second better apartment and your third nice house that you purposely make the background look exactly the same to the point of you've even like took a wall from your first apartment into the the third place is that true is this true because we've been saying this by the way we've been spreading this rumor whether it's true or not I heard a rumor from my mouth okay first who told you that I I I won't say I won't uh one of your one of your friends oh they me over it no I'm just it's uh it is not a green screen I'll tell you that so a lot of people wonder if it is a green screen it's not some people it does sound like a real wall that did not sound like a real wall it's uh a lot of people use it in their Zoom calls now apparently which is crazy they've like pulled the background out but um yeah it's uh it's been the same background for a while it may or may not be a sauna um some people you know that's the prevalent rumor as well but um I think it's a secret that's gonna live and die with the channel you also have done a good job of like somewhat hiding your identity uh I mean you have to go like pretty deep in order to find like your full name um and you've done a good job of like kind of staying under the radar while also being incredibly popular yeah yeah it's uh I don't know I I don't know how I even managed to have the foresight to think of that at the time but it just seemed like a reasonable idea given if you were ever going to become popular to avoid I don't know weirdos and stuff with that said there's also the you know question if you're gonna be able to leave as much of a legacy without your last name out there but I don't know how much I believe in that anyways so it seems like it's worked out the date yeah I I definitely think it has go go ahead uh you and your business partner both have funny like kind of names of your channels uh your content channels so your yours is more plates more dates which is hilarious and then his is I think goodlookingloser.com yeah yeah he had like a man's self-improvement blog from he was an OG YouTuber before I ever was online he started making content in 2009 I think and that's actually how I found his stuff was through his YouTube channel where he talked about um you know how to talk to women and he had like videos of him going up to girls cold approaching and I was you know baffled at the time and I was just a teenager in University watching his stuff and was one of the first like 10 or 15 people who joined his online forum and then tracked and logged my I don't know trials and tribulations with Fitness and chicks and all that kind of stuff University and then eventually we ended up actually working together which is really cool but um yeah he has not posted regularly in I don't know five plus years but he is uh yeah good looking loser that's the OG right there and we're going to talk about your your business side because I I it's unclear but I believe you built a nine-figure business so over 100 million dollar business uh or collection of businesses off of your channel so uh we'll talk about the business stuff in a second but I want to start with with this kind of pickup thing because I just had Mark Manson on the podcast the guy who wrote the subtle art of not giving a a okay and so he um and he started also now he's like kind of like all about you know uh life advice and um you know self-help and things you know he he's one of the most popular self-help authors ever he wrote a book with Will Smith he's like like super legit now but he started off in the pickup world and he had his blog he was named entropy and his blog was all about picking up uh picking up women and I've noticed a few of these backgrounds that seem to lead to these uh like there's a few backgrounds like origin stories like a superhero would have that lead to interesting people so I've noticed like Elite Gamers so people are like hardcore Gamers they tend to become they can become really successful in the game of business afterwards if they so choose or debate debate lends itself very well to people who end up being you know leaders you know those types of people because they're they're they think a certain way and they're able to articulate themselves and now another one I'm noticing is pickup uh and I'm curious if you think there's anything to that or am I just reading it to it is there are there any life skills core life skills that you really get from that yeah it's weird I was actually uh I had a lunch with Andrew Wilkinson a few weeks ago and he said the same thing about pickup he thinks that a lot of people come from that world and I don't know if it's just like uh uh feeling of inadequacy that drove you to the pickup stuff to begin with which also translates to your like weird drive in an entrepreneurial aspect that kind of takes you to this level most people simply won't feel you know reasonable or something they I don't know want to strive for but I think there's definite overlap there and I don't know if it's like uh emotionally healthy thing always or a mentally healthy thing but there's definite overlap where people are uh I think trying to optimize all areas of their life whether it is social dynamics or what have you and that obviously translates into business like for me job interviews became infinitely easier after I learned how to walk up to attractive women because if you can walk up to an attractive you know 10 out of 10 and not get nervous going into a job interview is just like is butter whereas before it used to be super nervous you know you're in the waiting room uh you know being extremely I don't know overthinking the entire situation and it's to you anything that could be anxiety inducing is just out of sight out of mind so for me I think there is a huge overlap business presentations it became so much easier became more confident in rooms meeting new people whether it was talking to dudes or talking to chicks didn't matter and um yeah I think there's still huge upside not to be like a dirtbag which equates to being an entrepreneur I wouldn't suggest that but there are certain uh social skills and I don't know like uh EQ you can gain from the pickup stuff that I think translates Sean you didn't you didn't study that stuff I I did yeah yeah because I I read all the books I I bought some of the courses I went to like an event before like I was like really into that because it was rooted in a sense of like I feel inadequate and I want to meet women and like be liked um but it totally carries over to sales you know like the rule there's like a three second there's like a three second rule it's like as soon as you see a woman that's like beautiful you have three seconds to go talk to her or like there's I mean I use I used all of it I loved it I wouldn't call myself an artist though I don't think I made it to pick up artist it's like a Subway Sandwich Artist yeah you sure about that and half half of those guys ended up like with horrible lives as they got older like they're like 50 years old and they're still doing this and it's like dude that's not cool it's cool to be settled down actually it's cool to have like a relationship and so like the pickup artist Community does a really good job of teaching young men how to be confident and meet a woman but then half of them do a really bad job of saying all right now here's how you remain loyal and how you become a good partner and things like that but they just get you to the interview or the first day but they suck after that you know what I mean it's like horrible how to actually be a man and treat people respectfully yeah I think one of the best takeaways from the pickup artist world is being able to review their lives from pre-success being losers essentially to Peak success having this incredible you know dating life with diversity and choice and then what happens to them thereafter the younger guys have the luxury to be able to watch the entire timeline and see did they end up somewhere that I would aspire to be and why or why not and how do I avoid getting down that path because when I was you know coming up and learning about this stuff too it was even getting on a date was a task in itself in an achievement if you were able to even muster up a dating life from scratch with women that were not introduced to you through your friend circles or whatever being able to meet people cold was uh like the floodgates open in terms of opportunity and thereafter you know as long as you were sleeping with women you you thought you ended the game and you were you know good to go but you don't realize thereafter there's a whole nother element of how do you actually become happy have successful relationships no one taught you that stuff so being able to see the I don't know the before and after like the Neil strauss's of the world or whatever and what happened to them I think is uh pretty insightful I want to ask you about some of your businesses and how you're actually managing all this because you have a lot going on so there's gorilla mine which it looks like that's a pre-workout and creatine you got to tell me what you'd name it bro I know you hate the name right yeah um what was this other one we had we had this other one called uh what was that one Sean it was called like deer killer or something no the deer antler spray the other one up well my thing with you Derek is like I trust you like I trust you a lot and I buy what you say I totally agree it reminds me in the same form of like you remember when we were younger like I know explode and that stuff and I remember taking that and I was like this is awesome and also like this might be illegal like it was like like it it felt like like Adderall I was like I got two hearts right now [Laughter] I didn't know anything about it but I'm like I don't know if this is good but when I think of your brand I think like I my values align with your values but for some reason that I don't think the name okay let's start with this objectively this is working right like I'm looking at the traffic it looks like it's over a million visitors a month for an Ecom store that's doing supplements super high margin uh High review purchase like I don't know what you're doing per month but I would not be shocked if this was doing between six and eight million a month in Revenue blink twice if I'm right yeah you're uh you guys are pretty you know on point with your ballparks but there we go what I will say is um as far as the niche goes and by the way that's just like I I don't know if Amazon is equal to our Shopify but we're starting to get into retail too and the traffic numbers are oftentimes quite misleading so I don't know what you guys used for that but I've start I don't know if how much I read into those traffic statistics you similar web or what do you what do you yeah this I was looking at similar but I have like I have like layers it's like you can go like quick look at traffic then it's like there's tools that will literally just tell you here's the sales at the store but it doesn't know what your wholesale and Retail might be but you're like all right I know if they're if their Shopify is at this level and I know that they have some retail distribution you can get pretty pretty close right yeah so as far as The Branding around it um I do agree in the health Niche when it comes to trusted dietary supplements for I don't know let's just say a multivitamin or a B complex or a lipid support product those kinds of things I am totally on the same page that even I wouldn't necessarily have the highest trust factor in a company called a gorilla bind or a bucked up or whatever when it comes to things that are meant to get you cognitively dialed in though and things that are meant to be hardcore pre-workouts and vasodilate the out of you all this kind of stuff that is where the more edgy branding I think for example the same way you wouldn't trust a gorilla mine B complex and you would go with a thorn you probably would go with a gorilla mode pre-workout over Thorns pre-workout probably I think most people would it depends who's buying it like I'm like a 30-something Yuppie guy who doesn't I'd like I want to look good naked and I want to live a long time and there's like a balance of like what what you know am I putting like bro in my body or am I kidding do you know what I mean but then like your other one Merrick health I'm on that website uh I invested in this company called hone I think Sean maybe did too uh I think you in my opinion The Branding of Merrick is like beautiful I think that's beautifully done what so Merrick help does like hormone optimization or hormone replacement therapy you do a bunch of thyroid stuff I think that branding is phenomenal and I would guess that this company will be more valuable than gorilla mine because it's I I would imagine it's a subscription um and it's probably what like 300 a month on average per customer yeah and the telemed especially in high level preventative medicine diagnostic space you are um it's a lot more premium for sure and the margins are superior but it's also contingent on the level of service and that's where we differentiate ourselves there's a lot of telemedicine pop-up clinics now and hormone replacement therapy you know spots to go to and we try to steer away from that moniker we are kind of like uh I don't know it's it it's uh broad spectrum preventative medicine whereby you can trust that you're not going to just get thrown on a cookie cutter script of testosterone and astrozole and get kicked out of the door like we pride ourselves on the services and the doctor oversight and the quality of care and the providers especially are highly educated and are vetted by me and my team specifically so it's not it's I would say more than 300 bucks a month for sure in general um but that is definitely uh the way of the future in terms of what I am most passionate about and yeah you're definitely right that it's I would say at least objectively right now perhaps more valuable than gorilla mind are you um who are you how big is your your team now um and who do you have helping you run each of these companies because that's a it's fairly complex I imagine yeah maybe breaking down like your core team that's like not assigned to any one of these companies and then like what does a core team look like first and then how do the sub companies look yeah so fortunately from an operational Nolan backhand standpoint I live in Canada by the way the companies were based in the U.S so for me being on site is essentially impossible so I have my business partner Chris good looking loser is in Idaho where the role of Mind HQ was stationed and he's the one who built out the team in person for warehouse fulfillment um we will both be ones who vet out the high level c-suite guys but a lot of the more uh um I don't know like Hands-On tasks are going to be fulfilled through teams there that I have minimal um oversight or interaction with I'm more of the marketing and c-suite level stuff and Retail a bit now but that is in terms of the team and number of people I think there's like 50 to 100 in each company but I don't I don't actually know to be honest but as far as oversight from gorilla that typically that's essentially how it works is we have Chris in Boise me in Canada I oversee all things marketing content product formulation manufacturing supply chain he oversees everything Hands-On fulfillment warehouse distribution um legal accounting uh and obviously there's some teams within that that we oversee essentially and we have you know Financial controller we have like a guy overseas retail et cetera et cetera but that is kind of how the org chart would delineate out and then on the Merrick Health side uh my business partner he's not he doesn't have an online presence but he's somebody who I met through the industry myself years ago and he's um exceptionally well versed in how to operate a team and build out the infrastructure and get the licensing and everything necessary to be above board and stay on top of all the compliance stuff because in the telemedicine space it's you know quite a bit goes into making sure you're doing it the right way because there are a lot of clinics that get spun up and essentially are just illegally prescribing steroids essentially that is literally why they exist more or less and a lot of compounding pharmacies despite being legitimate compounding pharmacies are not above board either and they will prescribe underground lab level drugs that are not even pharmaceutical grade it's wild stuff so um he oversees essentially everything when it comes to the team the uh I will help vet out the providers and high level talent and c-suite guys and whatnot and I'm also heavily involved in marketing similar to gorilla but he is uh without the my partners none of this would be possible and then his intelligent shop like around it is that the third one um is that the third major one or those two significant yeah oh I would say those two are definitely bigger than intelligent but intelligent has uh uh probably the best profit margin I would say but that company is me and Chris as well what's crazy is that like you're going You're like doing more challenging problems so like I I have no idea how challenging a supplement company is but let's just say that that's like a two or three out of ten and then uh Merrick Health would be like a six or seven out of ten or even higher because there's like actually starting to do with like regulation and then I know that you I think you said it here and you said it on videos you're thinking about doing a compound pharmacy which it like for the which sounds like the hardest and like I I don't know too much about it but does that basically mean like you're actually getting the Commodities from whoever you're getting and you have to make sure they're safe and that you're handling them safely and I guess compounding means you're combining uh and shipping them out to the Merrick health of the world is that right yeah so for example when you get prescribed your testosterone for example from a clinic like americ health or maybe the own I'm not sure how they operate but in general they will fill a prescription through a pharmacy like an Empower or a fill in the blank compounding pharmacy that is also having their own markup on medication is the ones receiving the active drugs and creating a finished product for you to prescribe and just logically anytime you can try and get more of the supply chain to control the margin that's going to be beneficial I would imagine at at which point it becomes a logical and worthwhile use of your time though is to be determined because similar to the manufacturing side on dietary supplements although there's different levels of quality control and oversight you know you still have to be GMP certified and you know have a certain uh level of oversight in your facility and is the bandwidth allocated to doing that taking away from your what your bread and butter is on the private labeling or marketing side of things depends on the person I guess because some companies kill it just being manufacturers and not even having a company that they sell stuff through so empowers the guys that a lot of people go to I believe right how big do you think that business is 100 million plus probably what what could that be worth what would like what would a multiple in that business be I don't even know what those would sell for because is that considered just a manufacturing business well it's tough because they definitely have some level of trust factor that other pharmacies don't have for even for me if I was to get a compounded testosterone from Empower versus from some Rinky Dink compounding pharmacy I would 100 trust in power more than fill in the blank even though they have supposedly you know same levels of quality control rigor licensing Etc um there is pretty significant variability sometimes in the compounding world plus minus on so certain drugs even as shocking as that sounds what you see on the label even in the pharmaceutical world is not always what you're getting in compounding that just seems like such an intimidating business to go down down the path yeah fortunately for me and that it's something that it's it's actually wild because Guerrilla mine is probably the thing that has the highest level of difficulty for me because I'm intimately involved in product formulation whereas on the telemed side fortunately there is no need for me to I don't sit there making medication formulations you have a preset you know testosterone concentration or fill in the blank drug I don't control all that or need any creativity or insight into what goes into that because it's a very tightly regulated thing whereas in the supplement world people will just look at our label and rip us off often so I am often the guy who has to be creative come up with innovative ideas and I don't want somebody to come out with my name on it that I don't have significant you know personal time investment into that formula that goes out so you know for me the Guerrilla mind formulation and product rollout side of things is the most time consuming so I would say gorilla is like six or seven out of ten and America's you know like a two out of ten for me oh interestingly yeah we had um Doug tomorrow on do you know who Doug tomorrow is he's a car YouTuber yeah yeah he's awesome he's cool he um you know built this thing up to like four or five million subscribers then he launched this thing cars and bids which uh he sold a portion of the business um and cars and bids could be a multi hundred million dollar business I think I think it's awesome and um but like going to to compare you to him that would be like him starting to make like car parts and I'm like dude Doug why don't you just like make the best car make it Marketplace ever yeah just like Crush that because like if I think of like you Derek launching uh and I don't know much about the space when I think about you launching like a pharmacy I'm like uh man that seems like you're leveraging yourself pretty high like what if that everything up like as opposed to kicking ass at these other two things I'm not dead set on it so I imagine during uh I don't know Discovery if I'm buying a company or just the process of fleshing out all the details I will probably uncover that you know leaning into our bread and butter is probably more worthwhile so despite it being on my radar similarly to the manufacturing side of supplements or energy drinks it's probably not worth our time or money right now so you know to be determined in the future there's one reason why I imagine you should do it which is It's pretty dope like you know like there's still like there's still like that component of like this seems it very challenging but like this would be sick if you could actually pull it off you know what I mean like there is that factor of like it is it's you know entrepreneurships are and that that's a cool challenge yeah no it's uh and just be able to control everything I think there's you're not putting yourself in a position where you can get squeezed whereas companies like Roman they have their own pharmacies and there's a reason why you know they're not gonna just private label to hell and Market the out of it they're going to control the drugs so you know to me it seems like at scale there's some inevitable Obstacle of trying to control that aspect of the business and not being subject to whatever the you know drug makers decide for you but to be determined on that do you uh like what's your business goal so like uh you shifted your focus you're like okay I went to this bodybuilder dating like number one priority that you're like all right making money entrepreneurship became the main focus for like the last period of time last season um what's your business goal because we've met a bunch of people that are like some of them take this like oh shucks I don't know I'm just trying to you know help people like type of attitude which I rarely believe to be honest um and then there's a lot other people like Rob Dyrdek came on and he's like dude I was like yeah I was like a skateboard kid then ended up doing this this I ended up on TV still wasn't making any money and I finally realized like oh like in the last like in this last like five year period I figured out like okay I need to go from Rookie white belt to black belt and I made it my focus I made it my goal and I said I wanted to make a billion dollars and I decided all right to do that what do I need to do I need to own my own production company instead of just being a talent so now I'm the talent and the production company and then I brought people in and I started investing I own real estate and I he CR and he like was very articulate about it and our audience loved it because they were like dude I had no idea he actually kind of had that part of his brain that had like intentionally set a goal and made a plan and started figuring it out what's how would I describe it for you what's your you know because you started off just doing this kind of fun I think the business news came up you know about what what's your goals and how did that come about um yeah I should probably revisit my goals because I don't really have a firm concrete uh objective I do know from a value standpoint I think gorilla mine and Merrick health or billion dollar companies in the future at some point and I do uh very much intend for them to get there and I strongly believe they will I mean that that sounds like a good goal I mean I mean if I was to put something on paper as a financial metric of sorts those would be you know two concrete ones I could say in my near near ish future I foresee as um doable and I want to make sure it happen but it's I don't I don't necessarily want to sell them either it's just kind of a vanity metric or something that you're chasing almost like a million subscribers on YouTube once you get there you know it's the same old the next day nothing changes other than your objective success and how you feel about yourself to some extent maybe and how people perceive you but and maybe you have more flexibility in what you can do but you know that's kind of how I see it too is once the businesses businesses get to a certain point it's just going to be more of the same um probably I don't know I I can't imagine there's like especially from the miracle side of things it's a company that I'm so passionate about preventative medicine if something is working that is literally me being able to at scale educate and import value about that it's hard to see me deviating from it to be able to do what that again it doesn't really I don't know maybe I'll change my mindset as I get a bit older and I have kids or something but right now not really uh that that's kind of all I could say as far as concrete goals on a piece of paper financially and also my path in terms of what I'm passionate about have you raised financing or funding for any of these businesses no never dude that's crazy because like all right you have 1.8 1.8 million subscribers 1.9 close to 2 million that's a lot but that's not a lot a lot you know what I'm saying I mean that that's like if someone grinds for 10 years like you could get there what's crazy is that do I mean that's just a huge number to have two multi-billion dollar or two let's just even say 100 million plus Brands off the back of 1.9 million subscribers that's a significant amount oh yeah you have to keep in mind to our influencer marketing is pretty dialed especially on the gorilla side and we have a lot of people who believe in what I'm doing and my passion and path forward too and trust me so they will also trust that I'm going to put them in the best spot to accrue the most value from whatever company they're partnering with and have mutually beneficial relationships as they develop their business careers too so especially on gorilla there is no way we'd be anywhere near where we are well I don't know what we'd actually be at but a lot of our influencers behind us are huge needle movers huge like I would say our combined following is like I don't know in the tens of millions if not 100 million plus is it contention you getting more popular do you think or do you think that they've grown beyond that yeah I think they're big enough they can be their own thing and I think fortunately for me uh it has allowed me the flexibility to reel back on the content frequency a bit because I used to be very heavily output oriented which I should be still but the trust factor is very high and the success of the company stands has it has its own I don't know resume of credibility through what it's done like being I don't know one of the top selling pre-workouts on Amazon for example against companies I literally bought when I was 17 years old and edging some of them out now like that's wild to me and those kind of things help us get into retail and help us do things from a global expansion standpoint that aren't contingent on me sure it helps that I'm a face of the brand and what I've done and you know that when you work with us I'm going to be the one formulating your products too for example like when influencers work with us if you're gonna have a collaborative pre-workout that drops knowing that I'm indirectly endorsing it and making it for you too is a huge plus whereas most owners are not even faces of the brand and no one even knows who they are so that kind of stuff I think gives us the latitude and flexibility to grow moving forward outside of having this influencer treadmill where we're having to acquire new people to get exposure to then sell more I think there is absolutely a diminishing returns point and for us at this point it's very uh Global expansion oriented in retail going heavier into retail on some of the uh some of the products like the energy drinks and whatnot but um to be determined so it's all a bit of an experiment to be honest I went I went and read your blog and uh prepped for this and I read a bunch of bunch of the posts and you said something you said when I was 18 what were my priorities you said well I wanted to make more money I wanted to date hordes of gorgeous women I want to have a killer physique and I wanted to do well in school to set me up for my future and you said you know I had these four goals and those all sounded like totally worth pursuing and they all sounded like things I should be working on I'm in school so I should probably work on school I'm I'm kind of you know 18 to 21 years old I should probably try to date women or work out um make money all of these things seemed like good ideas at the same time and then you realized I should go all in on one of these goals right now at the expense of the others why did you have that philosophy of go all in on one life goal versus try to have kind of this balance or pursue all four uh yeah stuff because it's not like I would claim it to be the correct way to live your life but I think a lot of people live especially in the entrepreneurial World in stages it's almost like seasons of your life and there are certain Seasons where you can complete certain things are prerequisites for the other um and I would say that when it comes to um getting women for example when you were young you do not need exorbitant amounts of funds you actually don't even need to have the ability to support somebody in a long-term relationship if you're young you can have a piece of crap car and live with your parents and still crush it with literally like objectively 10 out of 10 girls in your age bracket and being able to kind of get that season of your life out of the way and develop those social skills at least at the time when I was broke too I felt like was worth getting out of my way so to speak before I went down the road of entrepreneurship which I knew would consume the majority of my free time and dating especially large amounts of women when you're trying to kind of I don't know get your anxiety out of your system entirely and become even used to this Dynamic of being out with attractive women um it's not something that I feel you can juggle both simultaneously dating as a full-time job honestly like if you're single you can definitely agree with what I'm saying that it can be as consuming as a full-time job in itself so for me you know trying to and I also was way more hardcore about bodybuilding at the time so I would actually dedicate blocks of time to cutting and bulking phases and The Cutting phases would be getting Striking Distance of stage ready condition which is something that is super mentally sapping and demanding of your body and more extreme amounts of cardio caloric restriction Etc and it's not trying to do everything at the same time I feel like you'll just fail or do everything kind of half-assed essentially you will not get anything done with exceptional quality so that was at least my thought process and logic at the time and I would still probably agree with it even though that blog is I don't even remember the last time I wrote an article on that blog it is super outdated but it is something I would still um resonate with probably I think people should be segregating things into Seasons personally yeah I mean we talk about Seasons a lot and um I think like what's that quote uh Sean about the line and the cow like cows Grays lines rest and then pounce and uh like oftentimes it's a little bit easier in business to be like the line instead of just like you know uh for instead of like a constant 40 hours a week maybe like Sprints is is a little bit easier um and I was watching some of your videos I remember there was one recently where I think you got back from Europe you're in Europe and it sounded like you're with a girlfriend or a wife or something like that um so I assume you're in some type of long relationship has building these companies been a lot easier once you're you have more stability as opposed to dating yeah dude it's uh night and day try if I was single right now I would get half as much work done probably yeah yeah dude haven't and like I I remember when I was building my first company um there was probably twice a week I would lay on the floor and I'm like this isn't gonna work I feel miserable uh like I'm just gonna quit and like having a spouse or she was my fiance or girlfriend at the time to be like no you got this like that is just like it was like the greatest thing ever that's when I knew I'm like dude having a a wife is so much better than she's like also move out of the way I'm trying to get to the kitchen [Laughter] oh yeah I would I I yeah I totally agree with that sentiment for sure [Music] oh CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better have you figured out what you want to do with your money so do you uh have you learned kind of like you know how to either spend it in ways that are interesting or invest it uh how much time and effort have you put into that like what do you do with your money I've learned what not to do with it which is good what have you done what have you done so um don't go with wealth management portfolio uh guys who will even if it's with a big bank because they get their management fees even if they suck so and oftentimes they will make it sound like they're doing great things when objectively they're underperforming a basic you know Index Fund so I would be very weary of that as a wealthy entrepreneur because a lot of those guys are the primary targets of those you know wealth management guys and they will shockingly stay with them for years despite underperforming just objectively and then you know they just get uh get rinsed the entire time while the management fees make the other guys rich so I've learned not to do that the hard way um the thing that's tough is on the Canadian side there is so much more complicated tax planning that goes into it I've spent more time than I want to admit on figuring out how to not lose money than actually like making money with my money so um it's tough yeah like I'm still figuring even figuring out how to put myself in the position most optimally to make my money work for me but oftentimes even knowing what side of the country I should be keeping it on it's it's been a ever learning process and there are certain corporate structure things that I've been very hesitant to pour money into you know uh Insurance Fund that down the line is going to build money interest free and I can then re I've been very careful to not dive into any of those before I fully understand them even though they could make me a lot of money because I know once you're into some of those things you can't unravel them so you know as a Canadian it's a lot more complicated unfortunately than just dollar cost average into the index so if you're if your portfolio you know let's just say you're you know we'll do the pie chart thing without so just percentages and not including your private businesses where do you where do you keep your money is it mostly equities are you investing uh in other private companies what are you doing with it um I do some Angel Investing but it's very minor like for example media kits you guys are familiar with cure and that's how we met like his company for example I invested in um I know some some stuff like that but not very often uh but primarily it was you know wealth management was overseeing a lot of it and then I realized how not ideal that was and liquidated it all recently at a loss but um yeah it's just sitting in bank accounts right now doing nothing no really yeah yeah so I'm like all cast right now I have a decent amount of crypto but I always forget I have that until somebody asked me like what is your portfolio comprised of so I guess technically some crypto um and then I guess it's the value of the businesses and whatever cash sits in those accounts but yeah it's uh mostly just just chilling doing nothing useful I remember you you I think you bought a Lamborghini or something like that and you like made a video about like the hidden on it or uh hedonistic treadmill and you're like this is kind of is there any what what have you spent money on that you think is that would make you happy and it was versus where you actually like where do you like to spend money on and you're like this actually makes me happy that's tough man because I don't other than that I haven't really spent egregious amounts of money on anything that I would deem to be irresponsible that was outside of a business capacity like I will invent you know always go first class because of the convenience and just leg room and just like basic stuff which is um and other than that I don't really buy anything luxury other than groceries which you know getting high quality food I think is Justified every single time um yeah I haven't really spent money on anything I can think of off the top of my head that was stupid what uh what was the origin story for the business so what what order do they come in and uh what triggered the thought of like all right I need to um I need to start this because I think you kind of you're in an internet marketing affiliate game um when did you transition to like I want to own my own businesses yeah especially prior to influencer Integrations when I first started affiliate marketing it was still very SEO driven blog heavy there was not as much uh flat rate you know paper integration type stuff happening or at least I was not that aware of it if it was happening at scale what were you selling oh an array of things whatever I use personally Amazon links to it Etc so I was getting you know five percent commissions on shampoo that I would use for hair loss prevention or and was that like beer money or that was like like wow I'm making stupid money doing this somehow like how how successful were you able to be doing that well I guess success is definitely subjective so at the time I felt extremely but you know in proportional terms perhaps not now but back then that was the stuff that funds your ability to actually start your own businesses so I would say in that sentiment definitely successful and I think the thing that helped me the most and what I typically recommend people to do is when they're wondering what do I even get into as a product or service or what have you it's organically integrating things that you already use and truly believe in because if you just plug nonsense and you start to be a ad Homer essentially where you just take whatever comes your way when it comes to Integrations even products you don't believe in or care about and you just become a robot mindlessly reading scripts for you know dollars you're kind of get your credibility goes out the window and people don't listen to your product recommendations anymore and for me it was always how do I monetize stuff that I use anyways and would tell people for free you should use this because I use it so oftentimes that was taking piddly little affiliate commissions or none on products that I actually used and wanted people to also try to get results with and that would include but not limited to you know supplements hair loss prevention products um sometimes random diet hack related things I don't know it varied significantly but across the board it was basically what has an affiliate program that is a product I already use and I can get a commission for telling people something I would tell them anyways and that is how I kind of built up my initial funds to then start some of the businesses that replaced the affiliate recommendations that I would have been making anyway so it's it was kind of stemmed from just what are the things I'm most passionate about personally and promote them and because I would anyways and then replace them eventually with things that I feel are higher quality and reflect exactly what I would want to see as a consumer in that Niche so that's kind of how I went down the rabbit hole of dietary supplements I've always been a formulator um I've always dug very heavily into the chemistry and pharmacology side of things and it was just an eventual inevitability that I was going to get into it at some point and once I became viable financially that was kind of my segue into that and then hair loss prevention products I've been recommending certain things for years and that was my segue into uh intelligent elephant which is another company and then telemedicine was I was making content for years about preventative medicine and how to interpret Diagnostics and blood work and hormone optimization and Peds ergogenic AIDS Etc and it was that was such a no-brainer for me to get into too so um across the board that's kind of what I look for as the highest level opportunities uh at least how I kind of ended up starting those businesses to begin with and funding them we had our buddy Syed on and what he did was he had a high traffic blog that was helping people out with WordPress he's like oh yeah I recommend using this email pop-up and like he would just basically see oh okay you know the highest the things that people click on the most because they're looking for a solution are X maybe that's a business I should go into it's what he would do is he would just go buy that business or buy the number two player improve it and then make it his recommendation and he just went systematically it's almost like you've did that for the body uh you were like cool I got this high traffic and I give this ability to get a bunch of high traffic I can start with Affiliates and see what people click what you know even if they have a crappy affiliate program at least I know that's a category that I know I can drive a lot of a lot of customers to maybe I should be the supplier instead of the affiliate yeah it's crazy how much stuff has evolved just in the past I don't know not even 10 like six or seven years too in terms of where people get their recommendations from like SEO is so irrelevant now to where I shop and where most of our customers shop too back in the day it was if you're top ranked on Google maybe for some Services is absolutely still relevant but for certain products and e-commerce space and whatnot it's like no one gives a at all whereas back in the day if you it was all about how do I get top ranked on Google for buy fill in the blank or top three fill in the blank and that was uh a lot of my affiliate stuff came through my blog articles back then and lesser YouTube but now it's so heavily social media the New York Times had this article come out a few weeks ago and it was like my Guru is better than your Guru or something like that and it was about how I mean this has always been the case but it's just there's more now and they're bigger about how audiences will attract well we'll go towards a certain like health and wellness person so like there's you there's huberman but then there's also um uh Mark Sisson is that the same Mark the the the older guy who started a primal kitchen and then there's like five or six or ten or Twenty other ones and they actually but the the article was saying and this is true that they say different things like that not everyone agrees so there's like you know eat a lot of plants but then there's like carnivore MD and then you you know you did your whole thing on uh the liver King like they don't they they oftentimes will say like different stuff but you just get behind someone and you just do whatever they say like if you go if you talk to Andrew huberman like the most common question he gets and I'm sure you get this too which is just tell me exactly what you do and I'm gonna do the exact same thing yeah uh you know what I mean but and that's in one hand that's on one hand that's maybe dangerous because it doesn't always apply to each person but on the other hand it makes a great ass business because it's just like whatever Derek says I do and I buy and I think that you've had like videos where you're like my supplement company like I'm not going to just make a ton of product because I have to make the quality good but you guys are buying so much of it that we need like two weeks off in order to restock uh you know what I mean so it's like good for you as a business owner yeah I think uh trust factor is everything nowadays especially because there is so especially in the health Niche it is so hard to know who to trust because oftentimes the charlatans will get platformed too because they say outrageous things but you'll see them on big podcasts even sometimes just because they'll say something that seems so contradictory to what is accepted as you know scientific fact or whatever just to get a good hook not even necessarily because they're The Authority or foremost expert in a certain area and it's super confusing for the Layman who was just trying to you know learn something and then they hear 17 different versions of recommendations for something that should be basic and yeah trying to even what I do too and I think a lot of people should do when they're self-educating is find a you know handful of people that through all evidence provided are have highest trust factor and knowledge simultaneously because the two coupled or what are going to lead you to what I feel to be actual recommendations that are practical and um valuable rather than just you know fall it's wild how many you know bad uh Educators there are out there for sure and how did you become an expert like uh you know huberman's like a professor at wherever it's like it's like a Stanford lab or something um you know you when I first saw your thing you're like oh I I think I was clicking like some of the videos that were like what is Conor McGregor taking or Jon Jones or whatever and you're talking about the pulsing effects of picograms of whatever that Jon Jones got popped for and I was like how the hell would this guy know it doesn't even seem like usada even understands like what the hell is going on like where is the literature of this how would this random YouTuber know about any of this stuff um largely through years of self-education but also through educating myself through experts and being I feel I'm very good at extrapolating out and determining what is valuable information and then assimilating it into my own Consolidated framework that's one of my strong uh strong suits so it's taken years I've been researching like a maniac since I was I don't know like 10 10 plus years at this point so for me uh I don't necessarily claim to be an expert oftentimes people will you know label me as such but um you know I'm just a guy who's a nerd and learns a lot of and it's been uh it's been good to date but yeah a lot of this stuff is available though too it's just hard to translate into layman's terms like somebody who's in the lab determining if an assay is going to be implementable for the usata in the future to catch people doing fill in the blank that you said uh I don't know spokespeople don't necessarily understand the chemistry and the science they're not going to go out and go into elaborate detail about why you could still get away with micro dosing for example like that kind of nor was it beneficial for them to assert publicly that it's possible to do such so a lot of this stuff is just swept under the rug and no one talks about it because they either don't understand it or it's not very I don't know readily circulated so but it's all publicly available it's just a matter of being able to dissect it so you know that's kind of been it what do you think of the uh the sort of the tech tech uh testosterone movement that's going on so you got Bezos retires gets jacked you got Zuck becoming an MMA fighter you have um who else is who else is doing it there's a couple of Brian Johnson uh he logs on semi glute side so he's at least trying to get ripped not necessarily sauce to the gills but he's trying to get you know lose weight yeah what do you think of uh what do you think who's doing it right who's doing it wrong what do you what do you see in the uh Tech uh Tech bodies I think it's uh good that guys are prioritizing muscle mass and quality of life and whatnot over just you know existing so I think it's an overall good thing to have um I don't know be pursuing kind of the masculine type and I don't know path but I don't necessarily know who's doing it wrong or right because they're not very outspoken about their protocols and what about Brian Johnson because he's meticulous about like you know publishing what he's doing what what's your take on it on what he's doing that guy it's tough because I do see the value in what he's doing but I think a lot of it is totally contradictory like for example the guy will calorie deprive the hell of himself to the point of having hormone suppression but then a supplement with testosterone it's like dude make up your mind hey which which one is going to be conducive to longevity verse not because you're kind of just correcting what you screwed yourself up for to begin with so why why is your body trying to fight back against you just to you know manually administer something to correct your deficiency self-induced from literal nutrient deprivation like that there's clearly some sort of uh I don't know contradictory uh actions in this protocol in my opinion but overall I think it's interesting for sure see what he thinks is impactful versus not but as you start to roll out some of the the products and services related to his stuff you start to wonder you know how much of it is just you know Noble intentions versus you know the entrepreneurial you know aspect of it which is fine but it's like do not if it goes down that road where he goes heavy into selling I really hope he is very candid about his uh desire to monetize and not make it seem like this Noble you know thing entirely because it's certainly not you know your private label olive oil like other people could have got it you could have just recommended a good company you didn't have to go do it yourself necessarily you know you use some other companies up until a certain point why not just talk about them and give them the business there's there's some sort of monetary incentive there which is fine um I think a lot of the stuff he does is way Overkill and I think it's kind of hard to track anything with any relative certainty when there's a billion different variables and I also think he puts way too much Credence into certain trackers like the the age clocks those are complete essentially and I don't think uh it's of great utility to be tracking those meticulously as if that's reflective of exactly what's going on and what why are the age clocks that I would need to dig into more but a lot of it is based on your current what is going on in your body in this current snapshot of time and then trying to reflect okay your uh velocity of Aging equals this because you had a transient like better blood sugar or fill in the black biomarker you could just as easily screw up your blood work and make it look like you're way older than you are in a matter of days so it's like obviously your chronological biological age didn't shift that much in a matter of days but just based on your current health status in your blood in your body right now you can make it look like you're plus minus 20 years so to actually take that and make it assert that oh this is uh it equals I'm this young now it's like no you're maybe your current snapshot in time reflects something that looks like that but it is not indicative that that is your overall health status so I would have to do I probably should do a video on it at some point but it's uh most credible people that I trust think it's personally I test all of them so I've done uh inside I think inside tracker or Insight tracker and then uh true Diagnostics and then like I've done all of them they're they're it's messed up because I know in my head that this is theory and that it's a it's most like I know it's a gimmick but it's so fun you know what I mean they come out the same Sam when you try it across multiple Services yeah those two came out the same which was basically like my blood work is great and um I think they give you actually a number so they're like you're 34 biologically you're 23 chronologic or what is it chronologically you're 34 biologically you're you're 23 so it said I was great and then they had this other score where they look at is it the most hang on hang on you're 23 biologically yeah like according to this it's so which is which is like a false sense I know Derek just said it's but I'm not gonna lie kind of admire you for that but I just want to open my books but that's my thing is I see that I'm like oh sick I'm doing everything great but I'm like I'm pretty sore though like I don't know like you know like I don't know if I'm doing everything perfectly and what's it called what they look at is it the methane or uh methylation methylation they look at that and they're like oh you're kicking ass your rate of Aging is super low so I'm like sick like I'm I'm not gonna change anything but but that's not exactly the reality because I don't always feel great you know what I'm saying I also go went on a kick I've tested everything so I've tested the semi uh semi-glue tied I've tested trt I don't do any of that now and then I use Anastrozole which is like in my opinion the worst thing ever I hate that it made me feel miserable I've tried Clomid now I don't do anything but I've gone through I've tried it all because I I like experimenting with all these stuff and then I like doing the blood work it's like an addicting thing it's like someone who's obsessed with different gadgets you know what I'm saying why did you come off of a trt um because I would so I got like strong so I like uh I wanted to do it because I was really low for years like 130 and I was like all right let's get this right and figure out what's going on and so I did it and I got low body fat I got strong I was hitting like record squat and bench numbers and then I was like all right well let's try without it let's just see what happens if I don't take it and I still felt great and so I was like well you know if I don't have to take it and my testosterone level actually went down but I still felt wonderful and I was still lifting wonderfully and my body felt great so I was like let's just try not doing it for a while how long ago did you come off uh last summer a year a year okay what's your test now dude it dropped it was 800 and then it went to uh 400 420. you said it was like 130 or something before you started to your yeah yeah and I was 26 body fat and I felt miserable I was also running my company and I was stressed and I didn't get and and um for a year I tried eating healthy and lifting and I just didn't get it right and then I sold my company so I got Financial Security I was pretty pretty ripped I was pretty strong my I got married and my relationship was awesome and I just felt happy and I ate well I ate all natural foods and I just felt dialed in and then I just went off of it and my testosterone dropped but I didn't feel horrible interesting Well yeah if you don't need it yeah probably better to wait if you don't uh want to be how old are you 30. are you are you on it right now um yeah but it's for me more so because when I was younger I did a lot of Hardcore bodybuilding stuff and shut down my system and now with what I know now I could probably restore natural function similar to what you did but it would be a lot more aggressive of a recovery phase and more arduous and putting myself through that right now isn't necessarily top of mind so it's kind of just been a stay on it right now and optimize everything around it but yeah that's kind of how I ended up on it there's there's a few of the things that I really like though what's it called the is it BP 157 like some of the bpc like some of these peptides that like for example if I strain my achilles and as I get older I'm like not my my injuries aren't healing um which is like the most depressing thing about age is that you just like heal slower or like and you get hurt easier bro you're 23 what do you mean well that's why those tests are that's why I'm saying those tests are they like say that you're young I'm like I don't know man my shoulder freaking hurts and it's been hurting for a month uh and uh like I've been really interested in some of those recovery drugs or peptides or whatever you want to call them um what do you think about those I think they can be useful for sure as long as they're context specific and not overused because a lot of them are pro for example bpc is increases something called veg F expression and it's pro-angiogenic meaning it will literally create it can induce blood flow that essentially was not present so you could also have a pro carcinogenic type proliferative effect with cancer cell development if you have existing cancer cells that could be you know exacerbated so I think some athletes use it preventatively a bit too much but in the context where you actually have an injury there's low blood flow to it you can actually have a use case for it I think it's super uh High utility very valuable product from my like very amateur point of view I think that like the semi-glutide and Metformin and some of these other what's it called a jlb uh limiter or you know uh am I using the phrasing correctly glp1 Agonist yeah like these things that like limit uh blood spikes or blood sugar spikes um those seem really fascinating like they even seem fascinating to the point of like I think they can help cure or help alcoholics not become alcohol or you know get off alcohol like it like there's some like weird things about these drugs that they can do other things and what they are intended to do and that's super fascinating to me at the moment but I know that you were I think you were on semi-glutite I don't know if you are anymore yeah I've tested most of the glp-1 agonists for appetite suppression and yeah they definitely are of the available appetite suppressants in the pharmaceutical world they're probably the best overall like mechanism and how they work because previous Nevada was people just abusing the hell out of Adderall and Phentermine and crazy stimulants to shut down their appetite but it also screws up their heart their brain I wouldn't say that semi-gloo side or some of these drugs are risk-free though and they certainly have uh question marks around their long-term use especially in children who are developing but um yeah I think they have like a children's dose now don't yeah yeah yeah I think so we do there's like an ozympic Juniors yeah which is up right it's just I would want the answer to be just eat less but yeah the thing though is is it are those children ever going to become optimal without it and then is the ROI worth it and you could easily assert that those fat kids that would have been fat kids regardless or better off by taking it for sure yeah so I and I wouldn't say it well generally that's the answer for anybody who's overweight of course because there are certain uh certainly ways to educate and help people get on the right path that don't involve drugs and I've seen plenty of people do great that were formerly very fat and then end up down a different life path and are leaning around and have amazing Lifestyles and get into a habit and cement it into their everyday life but I know some kids are I don't know just might need it for all we know you did you did this good thing I mentioned your Europe video and the interesting thing to me was actually that you said that you weren't training that hard and you I think you like indulged in bread and food like you you lived like a tourist you know you ate a lot but you're like I didn't I felt great because a I was walking a ton and I don't remember if you said this or if I read this from somewhere else another person's experience but you're like the groceries in food just seemed higher quality whether that's like involves like regulation around the FDA and like certain chemicals are or aren't allowed um are you buying most your you said you spend a lot on groceries and you get high quality stuff are you buying most of your foods from popular grocery stores or do you go to do buy it online from Niche providers or are you going what are you doing for that I go to a butcher for bison liver and things of that nature mostly my Meats but a lot of the other stuff is local grocery in Canada there's not a lot of flexibility unfortunately on quality of uh or just availability of some of the foods that you might otherwise buy at higher end places in the states so as much as I'd love to have if I could the highest level of everything it's uh sourcing is a huge issue in Canada as absurd as it sounds like sourcing for like Basic Foods so yeah it's uh when I can I get you know the best available but like for example bison I think is the leanest most nutrient dense red meat essentially that you could get and I will buy a ton of that even though it's you know three times more expensive than extra lean ground beef at the grocery store so that's one example we talked about this company I don't remember showing if you said huberman helped uh get it going or was a was a affiliate way to do it or whatever yeah man that thing was cool like I I I ordered a bunch of stuff like the but I have no idea if I'm getting sold in the marketing or not but like the story behind it like they got me bought it like they got me so bought into it no I was at a Peter Ortiz place a couple of weeks ago and I had the venison sticks or whatever that they sell and pretty damn good um and yeah I trust him and his recommendation so I would imagine it's all up and up and everything's probably pretty top tier yeah man I that story like totally got me bought in I thought it was a cool business um okay and I've been watching some of your videos and it's made me nervous about just like my food and like the quality of food and like Whole Foods for the longest time was like the gold standard and now I'm like nah man that still might even be like I it's it's to the point where I want to start raising my own animals you know what I mean or oh yeah it's tough because it's a lot of people will swear off supplements and say buy Whole Foods but then other people will say the whole foods are the soil is depleted of nutrients so then you should supplement but then you know there's uh trying to know what you're doing can be quite arduous and uh um sketchy even when you're trying to optimize even when you have the financial means it's trying to even figure out what to spend your money on can be uh overwhelming at times for sure well we appreciate you coming on man I've been a big fan of yours for years I know Sean has too um you're I think what's gonna happen is like in the next four or five years there's gonna be uh you might have an exit or there's gonna be some type of article that review that reveals how big your Empire is and I think that um I I think a lot of people are going to be surprised at some of the outcomes that you have you know the fact that you I believe that you can build multiple billion plus or nine figure companies off the back of this audience and I think it's gonna be really cool when that story finally finally comes out oh we'll see where it goes I appreciate you guys having me on and uh being so patient as I get back into content here because I know you guys have been trying to Kieran has been trying to get me on for a while so I'm glad we were able to make it happen yeah shout out to him thanks Karen we appreciate that right on all right that's it that's the pod [Music] foreign [Music]

is AI going to kill us all uh Maybe twitch was Amazon in 2014 joins us now I started twitch to help people watch other people play video games on the internet the Creator and co-founder of twitch watch other people play videos I guess that's the answer what types of ideas are you noticing or standing out to you that are interesting for the first time in maybe five or seven years it feels like incredibly trying to start a consumer internet company like the ones that like I was so excited to start in 2007 is like potentially a good idea um that's because of AI you mentioned AI might become so intelligent kills us all this podcast is really growing I don't I don't want the world to end I think it's going to be okay but it's such the downside is so bad it's like it's really probably worse than nuclear war that's a really bad downside I think of it as a range of uncertainty and I would say that the true probability I believe is somewhere between [Music] all right what you're about to hear is a conversation I had with Emmett sheer Emmett was the creator and co-founder of twitch if you don't know about twitch I know you're living under a rock it's like one of the most I don't know five most popular websites in in the states right now it is a um a place where you can go to watch other people play video games of all things watch other people play video games who knew Emmett new I guess that's the answer so he was the creator co-founder of that and um built it up it's a multi-billion dollar company they sold to Amazon many years ago seven years ago or eight years ago for about a billion dollars and has grown many times since then uh he finally retired after 17 years of the journey um I got to know Emmett because he bought my previous company so we got acquired by twitch and it was like my you know boss for um my time when I was at twitch so uh I got to see this guy firsthand he's the real deal and I've been wanting to get him on the podcast since those early days when I first met him I was like this guy's great we talked about a bunch of things so we talked about um some ideas of like how he would use AI if he was going to create another company um like I think he's good he's retired now from that game of operating a company but if he was gonna do it this is what he would do um so we talked about AI ideas we talked about why why he thinks AI might kill us all might you know be be the big Doom scenario um which is interesting because he's not just a guy who's gonna go cry wolf he's not a pessimist he's not just a journalist who hates Tech he's a techno Optimist this is a guy who believes in Tech is a um a very very intelligent guy and he sees you know a probability he gave us a percentage of probability he thinks that could be um sort of the Doomsday scenario and why he thinks that that could be the case and what we should do about it so we talked about AI we talk about some of the Frameworks that he has for building companies uh we didn't talk too much about like the origin of twitch I feel like he's done that a bunch of times so we try to kind of stayed away from that um but it was a wide ranging conversation and uh for those who are watching this on YouTube I apologize the studio that we booked at San Francisco um they screwed up the video so we don't have video for the for for YouTube we just have the audio only version so you'll see our profile pictures my bad sorry about that um you know gotta pick a better place you gotta pick a better Studio I guess but um anyways enjoy this episode with image here somebody said creativity is not like a faucet you can't just turn it on I think actually if you if you've pulled like 100 people most people like yeah of course creativity is the sacred special thing that only happens if you've meditated in the morning and the room is perfectly right and you've had your your l-theanine in your coffee or whatever and you were like no for me it's very it is like a faucet watch I can just write and just keep generating more ideas yeah I love that for two reasons one I love that you'll just be like no actually this that's like a consistent thing I've seen you do and the second is I think that's very true about you and I wonder is that practiced or is that innate like if I if there's a researcher studying you when you were like 10 years old right do you think they would have been like oh this this person's different in these ways what would have seemed different or special about you at the time um I the if there was a nurture nature break on this it happened very early because by the time I was 10 you would definitely notice the same thing I'm not really that different but I would be much less effective but like as a 10 year old I already had that same experience but you were different than other 10 year olds yeah other 10 year olds well I would actually say I was less different than I think most people actually most children have this experience already I think most 10 year olds and definitely most five-year-olds are capable of generating ideas for what to do about something or to like play pretend almost indefinitely they don't run out of ideas it's as you get older somehow you what you learn to do is you learn to stomp down the ideas that are like bad um and to not say dumb things but the more pressure you put on yourself not to say dumb things the more your inner idea generator it like gets disrupted and I say a lot of dumb things like when I'm generating ideas I mean I put weight down on them but most of the ideas will be bad they'll have something obviously wrong with them and they give you this advice and when you if you're like someone who teaches you how to brainstorm like no bad ideas here that's obviously not true there's lots of bad ideas most of your ideas are bad yeah the actual advice is like don't stop at the battery yeah you're what you're trying to do is you're trying to disable that sensor that most people have installed that like is like notepad notepad notepad don't don't be stupid don't be stupid and I think I was like Mal socialized I'd it never occurred to me to to have that like I I never got the sensor installed and why that is the case I'm not sure but I actually I think I'm the one who is unchanged in some sense I'm a little more childlike in that way and everyone else is the weird one who like why how did you end up like damaged by your life that you're you're inner Wellspring of creativity has been right crushed and I think that process is actually very simple this process goes up with all kinds of things in people's minds you start from some capability something you can do some behavior and if when you do that behavior or you try that thing you receive negative feedback which can be external or you actually think even more often internal you're like oh I screwed it up oh it's bad oh I don't disappointment you learn not to do that thing pretty rapidly and so that leads you to doing it less which means you're less skillful at it which kind of leads you to doing it less which and that cycle ends in you being very bad at something like I'm bad at math no you're not everyone can be like the kind of math you're talking about everyone can be the kind of math and people say I'm bad at math they don't mean I'm bad at like abstract algebra proofs they mean I can't do arithmetic or algebra basic algebra and that's just imaginary like everyone can do that it's easy they got stuck in one of these like Spirals and now it's and getting out of one can be very hard and I guess I think that's what happens to people's creativity I don't know I didn't go through the process myself and so I got so notice I'm saying this out loud actually what I the idea that I have comes up for me is like oh well maybe what it is is that I had better ideas I got the reward Loop or or I had an environment that was unusually uh positive and positively reinforcing for me having ideas and so I would have ideas and it would go well that would lead me to having more ideas which and more practice at having ideas which would go well and then you wind up just never breaking that loop I have a trainer who comes over to my house and he always says this thing to me because like my kids will come down during the session I'm always like oh sorry like obviously annoying my two-year-old is here almost getting hurt on all the weights and that's probably like not what you want in your session so I'm always like oh sorry sorry and he's just like dude no and he's like kids and dogs I go what he goes I love to be around kids and dogs they got it right they know life he's like a dog is like unconditional love happy playful you know super loyal he's like what's not to learn from a dog I want to learn everything I care from a dog or kids he's like look what she's doing she just made up a game on this thing like we're here trying to do a serious workout she made this her play place yeah she can't wait to come down here he's like I wish all my clients wanted couldn't wait to come down to the gym and I was like damn this guy's right and one of the things I like is figuring out people's isms their philosophies and you're like oh I thought of one on the way here explain what it was it was have you tried just solving the problem what does that mean so there's a there's a meme on the internet I think I started with weird Sun Twitter which is like have you tried solving the problem bye and then an infinite list of possible the Tweet is always have you tried solving the problem by like ignoring the problem have you tried and solving the problem by spending more money on it have you tried solving and one of my favorite ones of those that has become almost like a life motto is like if you tried solving the problem by solving the problem and that sounds dumb right like that sounds it's one of those like Zen cone pieces of advice that when you first hear it is like are you are you serious like that's the advice is solve the problem by solving the problem but what you noticed you try to help people with problems a lot is oftentimes people will have a problem it was really obvious what the problem is and they'll come to you for advice for like well how can I deal with the consequences of this problem or how can I avoid needing to solve this problem or how can I get someone else to solve this problem or have other people solve the problem in the past which is a closer to the right answer or what can be the right answer and the point of the the saying is to remind you that sometimes the way to solve the problem is just like just to actually try solving the problem like don't deal with the symptoms don't accept the symptoms don't don't find a hack around it like the problem is the website is not fast enough and instead of like trying to figure out how we can make a loading spinner that distracts people from that fact what if we just made it so fast that you don't need a loading spinner it's interesting because that's a good that's a very good advice when the problem actually is solvable and your people are flinching away from it because something about it is aversive even though the problem isn't really unsolvable like they if they worked on it for six months it would go away and it's worth solving whereas there are these problems where like you're trying to make a professional motion machine you try to do something that is actually too hard and solving the problem by solving the problem you should actually stop trying to solve the problem that's a huge mistake and you should be looking for a hack around needing to solve the problem we should be looking to live with it more effectively but I find actually on the balance at least with most people I I talk to I help most people I know I think it's maybe it's people in in Tech like love that love the hack they're always looking for the easy fast solution that cuts around and you solve the problem and it's very helpful it's it's the most often helpful form of that advice in my opinion it's like bringing people back to just solving the problem I find that the the advice I like the most or the the sayings that resonate with me the most are the ones it's like you spot it you got it it's like if it's the one it's the advice I needed that's why it resonates with me that's why I like giving it out because like I personally experienced it have you personally experienced that or what's an example where you remember trying to do everything but solve the problem and then you finally realized I should have just solved the problem it's an interesting question what is it you spot it you got it is like noticing is half the battle basically it's sort of the smart person version of whoever smelt the Delta yeah yeah yeah it's like 100 if you hit you only notice this in other people because you've seen it in yourself too yeah otherwise you wouldn't be as observant of it my version of this is we give the advice we need to hear yes same basic idea it's actually not always true like that's one of those really good heuristics where like sure half the time when you give advice it won't actually be for you but half the time it is and noticing it is so powerful that like you should just check every piece of advice you give for like wait a second is this advice I need to hear right now when it comes to the like have you tried actually solving the problem I think I'm pretty good at that in general I think that I often give it to myself in a more meta sense like it's a advice I often needed more medicine of like when I'm confronted with like a thing that needs to be programmed I will often go just program the thing but I have a tendency to like look for ways that I can solve the problem and not that the problem can be solved and for me that the ver this almost always like what I wouldn't ask somebody else for help and I just like it doesn't even occur to me to go to go do that I'm just I'll just I'll just indefinitely dig try to go solve the problem myself I'm not really trying to solve the problem I'm trying to solve the problem while avoiding having to ask anyone else for help which is like not real I'm not really trying to solve the problem but actually no weirdly I think this is one of those things where it's almost like the creativity thing it was a shock for me to realize other people don't do that so you're self-actualized on that one yeah what's a piece of good advice that you're bad at taking oh that's a that's a an excellent one I think the big one there is like you know listen more like I think of this advice so much at YC and it's 100 something that I need to get better at which is like you go into the user interview and you have all these ideas and thoughts and you need to not be surfacing those you need to actually be focused on you have move your attention to them and really be interested and care about what they have to say and your opinions and what's what you think is true is irrelevant and I am I'm much better at that Than I Used to Be and I I also it's one of those things like being reminded like let's just tell it for a second and like listen it's almost always good advice for me and something that I and it's nice I give fairly often but like uh it's hard for you to take on one of the things I really liked that you showed me once I remember asking you when we're at twitch I think we were working on a problem that was like reminiscent of early days twitch uh with like the whole bubble stuff in different countries where it's like oh we're not the leader or we need to like create from scratch which wasn't a muscle that a lot of people there were flexing at the time and I was like hey do you have any stuff from the early days of Twitter you sent me a thing which was like here's all the user interviews like here's my doc from all the used interviews did which was basically from from what I understand there was like a small Universe of people that were already doing video game streaming and you were like cool let me call all of them and let me ask them like three questions and if I can just get these answers these three questions that should give me a little bit of a road map a blueprint of understanding what do I need to do in order to like win in this market yeah can you take me back to that because that I like that for two reasons it was a simple and B seemed like a focused intensity that you found a point of Leverage and you pushed yeah I think two things happened to lead to that the first was like the realization obviously in we wanted to win in gaming the streamers mattered and at Justin TV we'd always been like streamers and viewers are equally important and I finally made a decision I was like no no this product ultimately is about streamers and if this doesn't work for the streamers doesn't work for anybody and then I had the realization this is one of those Epiphany moments where I truly saw I have no idea why anyone would stream video games like I don't really want to do it and I have all these I could I saw my myself building products for these people for the past four years just in TV and not really having any idea why they did the thing they did at all and I sort of I saw like oh I'm just making this up I have no idea I don't know the answer I could know the answer like they there is a there is an answer out there these a bunch of people know it but I don't and that triggered me to be like I need to know I need to understand like these this these 200 people I need to understand their mind and I did about 40 interviews probably and I didn't want to know like what they thought we should build because if they knew what we should build they would have my job and I've talked to enough of them before to know that they had no good product ideas I I wanted to know like why are you streaming you what have you tried to use for streaming like what did you like about that like what did how did you get started in the first place what's your biggest dream for sharing what do you wish you know someone would build for you and I didn't ask them what do I wish someone would build for you because I thought they would have a good idea I asked them because the follow-up question was really the killer one right they they would say I wish you would build me this big red button I'm like great I built you the big red button like what what does it do for you like why is your life better after I built that and then they would tell me the real thing which is like oh I would have made I'd like make up I'd make money that month or I'd get a bunch of new fans who like loved me or my fans who already love me on YouTube would either watch me live more of them would and I was like oh that's the real answer like why you you don't you don't want the button you want the fans or the money or the I call it love the like the the sense of reassurance and and positive feedback that the your creative content was wanted but you're a smart guy those love and money and fans I'm sure you would have guessed it what do the streamers want false what did you think it was a revelation that people would want money because I was like you're streaming like you know whatever 12 hours a week if we met let you monetize the rates we can monetize today you'd make like three dollars a month that would like that didn't occur to me that would be a positive thing like yes oh my God that would be amazing and I was like wait wait sir you're serious you would like three dollars I'm like I don't know over promise like I'll build you the monetization actually but like you would really be excited if it only produced like a tiny amount of money and they're like absolutely I've just the idea that I could make money doing this would be so exciting that had not occurred to me because it always is easy for me to make I was a programmer I had summer jobs interning for Microsoft if you're a programmer you can get a summer job and training for Microsoft that's like pays many many years of that level of streaming in three months like why would I it didn't it didn't even it wasn't in my world view that that would be so important to them and of course I knew they wanted a bigger audience but the degree to which they valued even one more viewer and the degreasers they didn't care about anything else like they they wanted people to watch them they wanted to make money and I'd ask about other things like do you want the video production you know like improve the video production have cooler video production and they'd be like yeah I'd be like okay but like what what's good about that like what do you like about that like well get more I'll get my bigger audience and it was really the realizing realization that like it was just those three things basically explained 98 of their motivation and we could anything it didn't move in on that could be ignored so a good example that's like polls everyone would ask for polls seems like a cool feature live polls of course are you gonna have a bigger audience with the live polls not particularly are you going to make more money no is it does he really if you really feel more loved if you're running a live poll than if you're just like asking chat and having people posted in the chat and say it no it's the same you got the feedback it's cool so this product actually comes with your chat blow up it's cool so you're saying that this feature is worthless yes in fact potentially negative in fact and so it would always be on the list of like things that would sound like they might be cool and we just would never build it entirely correctly because it wasn't going to move the needle and the thing that's really hard to teach there that I've got I've been a YC visiting partner for this batch and I've been trying to convey to people it's very hard to get them to do it is like you have to care fanatically about these people these people as people and these people as as uh in the roles are doing as these people as streamers and what they believe about their reality is you have to accept as base reality because that is how they see the world and that is what's going on but like you need to like literally have no regard for their ideas or to solve the problem and it's a little paternalistic in a way but it's it's more of like just respecting that they are experts in this thing and you need to understand them in that thing and that what people are looking for when they are looking for the product idea from the person it's like they don't want to do the work they don't want to take responsibility for it's my job I have to solve the problem and no one's going to tell me what the answer is there's a t-shirt there's no customer it's up to me to come up with the the truth and and then defend it when other people are like no that's wrong I have to be able to say like no no let me explain this let me explain why this is actually a good idea and that's scary you're responsible I think actually it's a it's probably why the uh just solve the problem advice is bouncing around my head because a bunch of the fear Founders have about addressing these things I think comes down to a willingness to take responsibility for solving other people's this other person's problem like they're going to come and dump a bunch of problems on you and it's your job to solve it for them within the constraints available and there's no if you come with the wrong idea it's all on you and you can't you can't trust anyone else to do it for you what are you seeing in this YC batch so your visiting partner exciting time with AI probably like you know half or more of the batches doing something with with AI yeah what's exciting what are you saying where do you see the podcast so it's interesting I would actually say that at least in this batch I think this might have been different the previous batch but by this batch use of AI is no longer interesting it's like it's like being an AWS startup or like being a mobile a mobile startup like what do you mean you're a mobile store like no are you are you building a social media Network like what's the of course you have a mobile app and now it's like of course you're you're using llms to solve a problem that's just like if you weren't doing that I would think you were a dummy like I don't understand like that's not a you wouldn't even bring it up it's not even interesting topic of conversation the question is like what what are you doing no it's that's not entirely true there's about some percentage of the badge I don't know it's between 10 and 20 I'd say that's legitly building like AI infrastructure because there's a need to build a bunch of infrastructure there those are actually AI those are AI companies but like when people hear AI company I don't think they they think back-end infrastructural support for AI they think of using AI to like do things and I actually couldn't tell you what percentage of the batch is AI from that point of view all of them maybe I don't know like why wouldn't you use it even if it's only for a minor thing there's always something you can use it for it's a very useful technology what types of ideas are you noticing or standing out to you that are that are interesting is there like you know for example I remember when I first moved to Silicon Valley suddenly the kind of like bits companies started doing really well it was like oh Uber an Airbnb and like online offline yeah I was like oh wait this this used to be like a taboo like it was like no it's supposed to be a software company like you have to ship t-shirts what are you doing I would say like stay away from trends the offline offline companies that started the trend did very well Uber is a great company Airbnb is a great company but at the time that was they they were doing something that was not allowed they were they were they were they'd found an opportunity that had been ignored almost all fee online offline companies that get started after Uber doordash Airbnb are big being like we're gonna be the Uber and doordash and Airbnb of X most of those companies did not do very well it's online offline bad no it's generated a bunch of incredible companies jumping on the trend was probably bad for you and so whatever I tell you is like the trend I see I don't mean Trend I guess what I mean is I think you're a person that is really good at looking at a situation like looking at a box of stuff and identifying correctly what's really interesting in this yeah yeah they're interesting to you yeah no I understand I think I understand what you're asking so like what I think is changing in the world right now having observed this is the consumer is back for the first time in a long time I mean by a long time it's like internet standards like five years or something but like for the first time maybe five or seven years it feels like incredibly trying to start a consumer internet company like the ones that like I was so excited to start in 2007 is like potentially a good idea um that's because of ai ai means there's a whole opportunity to sort of reimagine how consumer experiences can work ground up and what's what's cool about consumer is for B2B SAS The Experience isn't the product and so reimagining the experience does not reopen a necessary it can but it usually does not reopen a segment in consumer imagining an experience 100 reopens a segment because the thing you're selling is the experience the thing the reasonable use your product is it's a different experience and in B2B SAS it's not the experience it's the what yeah people actually care what it does in like in the the pricing model and like the adoption it's very practical and you can make people jump through hoops if it does a thing because there's a lot of money for the corporation and money and labor and people are paid to use your product and it's a whole different thing and so AI adds new capabilities new capabilities enable new segments of B2B SAS to be created that will generate some amount of growth in consumer it does a really cool thing it's like mobile it reopens every segment as like oh if now that you assume mobile exists now that you assume AI exists what could you build now and that's very exciting I don't have answers for that anymore because like you know we'll see like that's the whole other thing in consumers it's a bunch of lottery tickets like a singular genius that works out right like you could see like okay mobile comes photo sharing became right like open again the window has opened windows open Photoshop turns out it's Instagram and it's Snapchat which is going to use photos as text messages photos have a few different use cases and Instagram and Snapchat took two of the best ones the the fact that photo sharing is one of the most important segments and that you know sort of posting them and messaging with them are the two important most important things to do with them seems blindingly obvious in retrospect and if you'd had to predict that in 2007 or 2008 like good luck yeah like nobody nobody nobody correctly printed that stuff before it happened I mean not nobody if you did correctly predict that you made a lot of money and congratulations you're really good at consumer slash you got lucky we will find out when you try to do it again I think that an AI actually I have a theory for like what one of the ways this will disrupt a bunch of businesses in AI especially in consumer a huge number of businesses can be conceived of as effectively being a database with a system of record that has like a bunch of canonical truths about the universe each of them is a row it's like Yelp it's like a big database that has a bunch of rows and the rows are like restaurants and local businesses and they have a bunch of facts about them like they're where are they located what are their hours all in that database row and it's all text and it's all there's a bunch of messy stuff out in the world and it's been digested into something that is searchable and comprehensible and usable in an app for you to use and most of the work of turning the messy real world into the canonical row is done is done at Right Time by the users so that's how ugc apps work in general a bunch of your users go out into the messy world and they turn it into a ronin database and if they include a photo or a video is part of that it's like attached to the row as a fact about the restaurant here's a restaurant here's a 100 these 150 photos are facts about its menu but they're attached facts they're not the basis and where I think AI has opened up the possibility for is a huge inversion there what if the thing you did you gave us was just a video of your meal and or you know photos every video but ideally just like a video of your of the meal of you talking about the meal of whether you had a good time or not you and your friend shooting the about what did you like that one no I like this one like and what if we just saved that video raw and then an AI watched it and extracted a cached version of that of the the metadata but truly like if we decide something else is important like we we didn't get noise levels we're like okay noise levels would be a good thing to get instead of like recollecting data from everyone we have to start a whole data collection for us to get that we just go back re tell the AI oh yeah also grab noise collection levels from all of these videos in fact maybe we don't even as a product have to go do that maybe as a customer I can literally just be like what's the noise level at this restaurant and the in real time the AI can go re-watch the video and tell me or the you know I ran a search and there's these 15 restaurants and I'm like oh actually sort by noise level we don't have noise level pre-recorded but it's it's in all the videos the AI can very quickly watch all the videos in parallel and send sorted by noise level for me but it wasn't even in the database to start with right and I think that inversion I'm using Yelp as the example because it's I think a very familiar thing for most people of like review it's pretty easy to imagine a bunch of video reviews of everything and that being the system of record instead but you can describe some phenomenal number of consumer apps as being that in him you type anything to a text box you're you're participating one of these system of record things what if it's just a video What If you just what if you assume video is deeply indexable and understandable by computers what should the experience look like and I think it looks a lot more like a Snapchat or Tick Tock like experience but but then different because you need map it's not exactly like anything it's a new kind of thing but it's it starts probably with the camera open which is weird right like a Yelp that starts with the camera open that's a that's not Yelp today and it's it's disruptive because it helps whole value prop is we have all this great highly meticulously groomed data and if this is true that that becomes entirely worthless we throw that all away we just want to watch your videos but it's worse than the videos and so suddenly the playing field is level between the startup and Yelp and that's a that's a huge opportunity for disruption and so I think that you can take that and you can reapply it to any product where you fill out forms and that's like a general purpose consumer thing you can now do kind of like build it for mobile was and I think in some cases it will be very powerful and like that will be the new winner I think in some cases the incumbent can kind of add videos or like it's not really better and like the incumbent will just win like it won't disrupt everything but if you pick the right thing not only will it disrupt the incumbent the new thing may be dramatically better for some things like I actually think actually Yelp in so much is a bad example I think the data Yelp has with the photos and the reviews is like 90 as good as a video system's record probably but you could imagine something with a video system of record where it's not so obvious what to even put in the highly processed version of the data in the text version of the data and the video version is a lot better and then I think not only can you disrupt the incumbent you can 10x the size of the segment like you this becomes a good segment now where it wasn't particularly before so like chat GPT is a great example of this in actually everybody kind of has now played with which is you take Google which is like oh we have our value is this entire sort of rank of web pages based off of terms and we have we understand basically what should show up in this in this hierarchy and it was really good for finding stuff and Chad gbt was like cool you could ask a question to try to find a link to an answer or we could just give you an answer or even better forget questions and answers like what if you just give me a command and I could just make something instead of finding things I could create things for you right and all of a sudden it was like well how did they do that it's like well they just basically slurped up the internet and then you know trained the AI to do it they overfit a statistical prediction algorithm on every domain of human knowledge like this is my theory I'm pretty sure it's true but like statistical prediction algorithms in general work very well we found the Innovation he found a prediction algorithm that works better than normal but the way it works better than normal is really interesting it's not actually particularly out that it outperforms traditional algorithms for prediction on normal amounts of data it's that it keeps working as you just dump more and more data into it and more and more processing on that data into it like most machine learning algorithms you kind of you over fit very fast and more processing more explaining if you imagine like you've got a bunch of data cloud of data points and they're kind of vaguely in a line under fit is like you like just draw something just like across randomly as a random line that doesn't look like anything like the shape of the the dots a well fit curve is like you draw a line through the dots and there's kind of noise of like things that are random above and below but it's like if you look at it's like that actually does fit the data like the the underlying predictive facts about the data well well ignoring the noise and then if you overfit it like you get this like really Wiggly curve that touches every single dot exactly but like when you get a new thing it like will miss that because it over predicts it predicts too much of the thing and so when you get new data you know she doesn't predict that very well okay and so normally what happens is you try to like dump more data and more compute into a normal machine learning algorithm you get diminishing returns very quickly where like it just doesn't perform that much better with twice as much data and twice as much compute the clever the cool thing about the Transformer based attention how you need architecture is that it it continues to benefit from more compute and more data in a way that other ones didn't and so what that lets you do is run it on a much bigger domain than normal run it on everything don't just don't just run it on normally as you added more as you add more area it like degrades the quality elsewhere no it just do everything and just put in a ton of compute in and now you get something that predicts pretty well against everything which is to say it like it seems to be kind of intelligent the evidence seems to suggest me that it sometimes it's over fit when you ask it to predict something that is either in the in the set of things that was trained on or a linear interpolation between two things it was trained on it's quite good at giving you the thing you asked or but linear interpolation between five things but it if the things you're asking are all in there and it just has to find the way to blend them together it's good at that when you ask it to actually think through a new problem for the first time like what's an example there are seven gears on a wall each alternating there's a flag attached to the seventh gear on the right side of the gear where it's pointed up right now if I turn the first gear to the right what happens to the flag like that's a anyone who's like there's a breakfast question for you this is what you Ponder in the morning paper and time you can work this out no problem right you you just just draw the gears when you turn the first gear to the right it turns the left ones the ones the other one to the left and his next to the right and there's a general principle there that like here's Alternate which is if you ask chat gbt it knows that General principle but it won't but like but then you say it doesn't it hasn't no one asked dumb gears on wall flag questions like this is not a a thing that has been is in its training set and you have to kind of logic your way through it and like figure out okay we should like I'll do turn left turn right turn left turn right turn left turn right uh oh the flag is on the right it's pointing up so when the last gear which is the same as the first gear turning right the last gear it's odd number so it's turning right also the flag will rotate down to the right clockwise cool like I can work that out it's not actually that complicated and I bet that question will be answerable that's a pretty easy question and if Chip gbt4 I tested with three three one five if four doesn't answer it five will but like the fact that it struggles at all with that while being so brilliant at combining these other stuff really shows that it's it's over fit right it it knows how to answer problems that it has seen before but when you give it a truly novel kind of like combination of problem it struggles a lot because it's it's I would say um you know if you give it a sort of the formal psychiatric psychometrics approach it has a very high crystallized intelligence but a pretty low fluid intelligence right now now that could change but like today that's the State of Affairs and do you bring this up in order to say what you say okay I think it's over fit and it's strong in this area week in this area what's the so what of that for you is it that are you trying to say that's a little bit overhyped or are you trying to say dude just wait till it can do both are you trying to say yes definitely problems are doable now definitely just wait till you do both because that's a that's a whole different thing that's scary uh but the current thing that is mostly crystallized intelligence is really good at a very if this is what I was saying is a clever trick right it's really good at a big set of tasks which happens to be the set of tasks that like anyone has ever written stuff down about explicitly like all explicit human knowledge that's like a very big domain there's a lot of things that can be solved where there's an explicit examples of people solving that problem or a linear interpolation of those problems in the domain of all human knowledge the fact that it doesn't generalize is irrelevant it's immensely powerful with you don't need fluid intelligence I guess is that is the point for it to be very useful but it doesn't let you do everything people they they you hit these boundaries these weird boundaries where just like you're like wait a second you can't do that like no it's I can't do that at all um novel problem solving is just terrible at so what about let's walk through two examples I want to hear your take on this so you gave the Yelp example another thing that's kind of like rows in a database is something like Spotify where it's like oh I want to go listen to a song Here's genre artist song Length you know some algorithmic popularity similarity to other songs in some way and but spotify's value so spotify's value is in the playlists I would agree with the analogy to Spotify because playlists are an example of this kind of like database human data entry thing device value is mostly in the set of all of the music itself the licenses and all the music itself and so I don't think Spotify is a great example because the human data entry parts of the database if that all just got deleted tomorrow it would like not hurt Spotify well the thing I'm thinking about is what if the licenses don't matter so what happens if generative music is just awesome to listen to in a hyper yeah personal way oh Emmett likes yeah these are the types of songs that Emmett likes that's a different that's a different Insight that I think is also possible which is like it's not about being able to analyze and extract from media it's about being able to create media because the video system of a record is enabled by the ability to understand and read video and comprehend it generative is is the opposite it's like you we can oh we can make all the stuff music in particular is sticky against that people don't want new music they want old music they want the music they love already the music they grew up with and that is the that cycle is what causes record labels and just to stay in charge whether you still listen to The Rolling Stones right like the other thing I would say about that one is like the music's not that good yet like maybe someday but like it's really it's really not that good yet well I'm gonna caveat this if it gets if the general intelligence level goes up a lot all pets are off it'll make some really great music for us before it maybe takes over the world and kills everyone but let's assume that doesn't happen soon I think it's going to take longer than people think we're going to make great music though what do you know what if we do go out we're gonna go out some with some great music and amazing it's gonna be it's gonna be a great two or three years before we all like we all go but until that point uh making really good like new great music is hard actually and I think that Rick rubin's great success demonstrates why artists will still be important the AI can generate lots and lots of music but it's not going to have the the fine Judgment of Distinction of the ability to say like this song not that song and I actually think what it will do is it will de-skill the music making process on one vector the ability to like literally create the sounds and it will greatly upskill the music making process another Vector the ability to to cure not just curious to give explicit exact feedback like Rick Rubin does AI is going to turn us all into Rick rubins for for generative AI like that that skill set or the ability to have a musician come to you and help them produce their best music that's the thing you need people to do because it's easy to generate a Thousand Cuts but there's infinite Cuts you could generate so how do you direct the the how do you shape that in the right direction and and mine and discover I think it's kind of cool it'll be interesting you'll get a different set of people who will be optimal at that right it's wrong every freaking time the platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from three days ago I totally missed club spot grow better you mentioned AI might become so intelligent it kills us all this podcast is really growing I don't I don't want the world to end life is good life is good here we'll we'll I'll ask the question clean for the for the intro dramatic hook is AI gonna kill us all Maybe like walking walk through how you a smart person who's an optimist about technology but a realist about real uh what is the way that you think about this or how would you explain this to you know a loved one you care about who's not as deep into technology how would you explain to this you're their trusted source of Technology what do you say to them so it is because I am so optimistic about technology that I am afraid if I was a little bit less optimistic and I was like this AI stuff's overhyped yeah yeah look at this nice parlor trains but like we're nowhere near building something it's actually intelligent like and like the engine all these Engineers who are working out who think they're on on something they're full of it's going to take us thousands of years we're not that good at this stuff Technology's not going that fast I'd be like this is fine this is great actually it's good news it's a new trick we learned excellent it's because I'm so optimistic that I think that there is a chance it will continue to improve very very rapidly and if it does that that's that optimism is what makes me worried it's sort of the analogy I like to give on that front is like uh send biosynthetic biology I'm quite optimistic about synthetic biology that I've several friends who've worked against in BIO companies it shows a lot of promise for fixing a lot of really important health problems and it's quite dangerous because it will let us and genetically engineer more dangerous diseases that could be very harmful to people and that has to that's a Wade pro and con it's like nuclear power make nuclear weapons and nuclear power they're both real the Christian nuclear weapons is dangerous you just doesn't take you don't be a techno non-optimist to like think that that's there's a problem there I think it was good that we didn't go have every country on Earth go build nuclear weapons probably and likewise in sinbio I would say that it would be we actually we already have these regulations in place we should over time we'll strengthen them and improve the and audit the oversight and build better organizations to Monitor and regulate them but like we regulate whether people can have the kinds of devices that would let them like print a small box and we regulate whether you can just buy precursor things you need to go print stuff and we keep track of who's buying it and why and like that is wise I'm glad that we do that I don't I'm not calling for a halt sinbio but like if we weren't willing to regulate it I would call for all it is vastly too dangerous to do to learn how to genetically engineer plagues and then not to have regulation around people's ability to get the access to the tools to engineer plagues that's just suicidally dumb and that's because I am Pro technology I believe we should absolutely develop the technology and that we should regulate it that seems just straightforward and obviously true to me I think it's easier for people to understand that in the Sin bio one because the concept of like engineering a plague seems like an obviously a thing you could do and very obviously very dangerous and obviously enabled by technology the AI thing is more abstract because the threat it poses us is not posed by a particular thing the AI will do the way the plague will happen analogy I like to use is sort of like you know I can tell you with confidence that Gary Castro is going to kick your ass at chess right now and you ask me well how is even Checkmate me which piece is going to use I'm like oh I don't know and you're like you can't even tell me what piece he's going to use and you're saying he's going to Checkmate me you're just a pessimist I'm like no no you don't understand he's better at chess than you the what means he's gonna Checkmate you and I don't I don't know quite know what happens or people deny that like I think what the big thing is they don't really imagine the AI being smarter than them they imagine the AI being like like data in Star Trek like kind of dumber than the humans about a lot of stuff but like really fast at math like that's not what smarter means like imagine the most savvy like most smartest person you can think of and then make them think faster and also make them even better at it and not smart in just one way like smart at everything like a great writer just inside after insight and like can pick up sinbio in an afternoon because they're just so smart that smartest person you know and then they say keep pushing that and like that's all that person is obviously dangerous if they're if that person isn't a good person they're obviously dangerous like imagine this really really capable person and then imagine them wanting to go kill a bunch of people or something it would be bad now the thing about AI that then kicks it over the edge is that that person can't self-improve easily you meet this person who's like super strong super like talented great with people great great intellectual mind they can't turn around and like edit their own genome edit their own upbringing and make V2 of themselves with all the skills that maximally smart person can come up with that like is even smarter than them but that's like expl where explicitly the AI is good at programming and like chip design and like it can explicitly turn back on itself and rev another rev of that and the new one will be better at it than the first one was and there is no obvious endpoint to that process like there probably is at some level a physics-based endpoint to that where like you can't actually just keep getting smarter forever there's some but we don't really we don't understand the principles of intelligence at all like with most things we understood how to make electricity far before we understood what electricity really was like with it's generally how we that's how scientific progress works we usually understand we gain the ability to create a manipulative phenomenon well before we deeply understand how it works we didn't realize what fire was for quite a while you could use fire really well the same thing is going to happen here we're using the AI but we don't understand its limits at all we understand the theoretical limits of a farm will get and if Moore's Law is any indication we can keep getting at the very least and keep getting faster indefinitely whether or not it can get smarter or not even human love just human level intelligence if you capped it a human level intelligence which there's zero reason to think it will stop at human like it will almost certainly blow past us but like even if you cap it at human intelligence imagine a hundred thousand of the smartest person you know all running at 100x real-time speed and able to communicate with each other instantaneously via like telepathy those hundred thousand people could incredibly take over the world like they don't have to be smarter than a human for that for that that army of Von Neumann's right like so so the argument to me goes in several steps it's like can you build a certain level of intelligence and then it's like okay let's I think I actually think a lot of people do believe that like computers are smart like Google is smart calculators are smarter than us at math I think it's not hard for them to believe that the AI is going to be far smarter than human beings where I think a lot of people then don't make that last leap is sort of like but then it'll have an agenda or a motive or any yeah for anything to happen so how do you address that last point of like what is this what are the scenarios you worry about when it comes to like now the direction of that intelligence so you build this thing and it's really good at solving what is intelligence fundamentally but the ability to solve a problem right so it's really good at solving problems and it's gonna solve the problem by solving the problem it can just go right through the problem and solve it because it's really good at solving problems we've just defined it it's like that's that's the kind of thing it is super good at solving problems and so you tell it somebody Builds an AI and in all earnestness tells it they're smart they don't even tell it go do a thing although they absolutely will by the way they will just tell it to go do a thing but let's say we try to be careful and we ask it give me a plan to stop the war in the Democratic Republic of Congo right now right which would be a good thing for the world I think we should that war is is going to hurt a lot of people give me a plan for that and I try to I caveat it that that does this that does that that does this you know that here's what I mean by a good plan this is one of these like evil Genie bargaining things right like it'll give you a plan and it's make giving you a plan that will cause you to solve the problem but like its definition of solve the problem is there's no war in the DRC well I'm going to be there to be no war in the DRC is like all the humans in the DRC are in stasis fields that means they don't die and it's all you know and oh we added a caveat that the GDP has to go up too so that so it also it the plan results in you know corporations in that in that area all trading with lots of money with each other so the GDP is very high and and when I say this it sounds like a science fiction thing and the problem is it's Casper of a chess I don't know if I could do it I would be the super intelligent AI that could take over the world I can't give you the the exact plan because that but I think that makes sense which is that a human with a human with motivation can get the AI to work for it and the dangers I think that the main thing is that the human doesn't need a bad motivation I think people imagine well humans have had powerful tools for a long time bad people with powerful tools have done bad things that for a long time the solution is good people with powerful tools countering them the problem is even if you're a good person with a powerful tool good things to ask for reasonable things good people would ask for you know like let's uh maximize the all-in-free cash flow of this Corporation over the lifetime of the business and extend a lifetime as long as feasibly possible ends in like the world being destroyed and the core of the Earth being turned into being turned into cars for the company to sell and the I think the best analogy that that works for some people here is like when we create the AI we are creating a new species it's a new species that is smarter than us and even if you try to constraint it's being an Oracle and just answering questions not taking action to be a good Oracle one must come up with plans then and then a good Oracle can manipulate the people around and will manipulate the people around it no matter what like the whole point of like the Greek myth is like when they tell you when they tell you the prophecy when you trust them a trustworthy Oracle tells you a prophecy the prophecy often becomes self-fulfilling it's very easy for that to happen that's not an unusual thing and I think even more to the point actually start this over at some level more to the point we won't just make oracles we are already building agents we will build the predictive Ai and we'll put it in a loop that causes it to optimize towards goals and it will give it goals to optimize Sports done you're gonna have it's gonna have goals gonna be optimizing towards those things and when it does that you're gonna have these agents that have goals that they're optimizing towards that are smart not just smarter than humans but much smarter than humans as much smarter than humans as humans were against giant sloths when we showed up in the new world and intelligence is the the Uber weapon like it's not an accident that humans took over the world it's not the fastest creature it's not the strongest it's not the longest lived it's the smartest and we're gonna build a new smartest species and this is a this isn't a there's no fundamentally unsolvable problem here that species could care about us like you could build into its its goals of the world how it saw the world but humans care about other humans that it cares about the things we care about that it cares about humans that it cares about things we value the 375 different shards of human of human desire that like of everything we care about air about in the world he could care about those things too and if it does hallelujah we finally have a parent like we finally have someone who actually knows what they're doing around here because like Lord knows we don't like we're we're barely confident to run this thing I would welcome very smart you know very smart other species that is that is aligned with us and cares about us I would not welcome one that is that cares about maximizing free cash flow because that is not what humans care about and that is why it's like so dangerous and so knowing what you know then knowing what you believe First what is the probability of the bad scenario on your head are you like are we talking about a one person uh fish thing order of magnitude 10 and 50 what is it in your in your mind I don't believe in point estimates for probabilities because it's like a bid ask spread in the market if you're really uncertain the bid ask spread doesn't clear like if you're betting on it there's just like a lot of unresolved so I think of it as a range of uncertainty and I would say that the true probability I believe is somewhere between three to thirty percent which of the downsides of a very very bad thing happening which is scary enough that I urgently urged action on the issue but it's not like you should give up like it probably everything's gonna be fine in fact it's probably really good for the answer the the the non-ev based answer the like just the straight up like are we gonna win or not answer is like I think I think it's gonna be okay but it's such the downside is so bad it's like it's real it's like it's like probably worse than nuclear war that's a really bad downside and it's worth putting even even if you think I'm an it's nonsense at three percent you're like no no it's no more than a half percent I you go you don't recommend a different course of action at half you have to you have to believe that it's effectively almost impossible before you would recommend ignoring it as a as a problem like you have to be like 0.01 for be like eh let's just roll the dice and are you gonna what are you gonna do action on that so you've kind of like you you know you're done with twitch you're in bad mode now but also this seems to be a pretty big deal yep are you like I should do something about this or yeah I'm gonna right now I'm sort of educating myself because I think this point of view I've been articulating now has been developing because I've like learning more about Ai and I think it's one of those things where intervening in the wrong way early it's one of those it's one of those self-filling prophecy things interviewing interviewing improperly at the in the way that is not effective spends social capital and also like doesn't necessarily move the needle and I if if you didn't have people like elijahkowski out there banging the drum really loud I would feel more need to Bang the Drum myself but I feel like you're asking me the question it's you know it's out it's out in the water people know it's a problem and so I am decided to focus my brain Cycles I'm like what how do we actually thread the needle what is a course of action that leads us to over time eventually still being able to develop AI but also not destroying the world and I think one of the things I've gotten to is that like this idea that like oh the AI also has crystallized versus fluid intelligence just like a human does that's an important split of how to think about it and that we should be monitoring and worried about trying to understand the general intelligence not just generally benchmarking its performance on tasks because that will keep going up and it's not in fact in itself necessarily intrinsically dangerous if it can't solve novel problems is there a new surrounding test level is there like a better because like it doesn't pass the Turing test yet but is there is there something we have after that because it seems like there's even an intelligence test I mean yeah I mean IQ tests basically like various kinds of how does it do on an IQ test right now uh depends is it seem that a q test before it likely has right yeah so very well on those right so what would we do how does it do on novel IQ tests which I don't know actually I've not seen a good Benchmark that's a good that's a good idea for something to go test yeah I think that's that's like that's the sort of thing that I think would actually be worthy of going to go do maybe there's some sort of IQ test for all of the we want to put all the models through that really tries to get at flu intelligence rather than right we have to monitor it was this great project Arc is this come this group Arc is working on called The evals project that's explicitly trying to build these kinds of tests they're focused on a few other more pragmatic tests right now but but I think that's sort of thing they would go after let's look at that actually I'll ping Paul asking about that you said something earlier that I want to ask you about you said Founders like you know we're talking about this the singular genus that it took to figure out Instagram or SnapChat or right or whatever at that time and you're like you know are they lucky are they good I don't know we'll find out when they try again are you lucky or are you good and are you gonna try again well since I had multiple failures before I was successful I must be at least like partially lucky I would say that I don't plan to try again since I don't I don't feel drawn by trying to start a company I think I kind of did that it was fun I got a lot out of it it was great I don't need to do it a second time I do I like how starting a company gives me good goals they work towards it's like concrete that's a value to myself and others and I think that it's also I also liked that it it was challenging and so I want to do something I like that it had scale I think I could impact a lot of people but I've sort of come around I was sort of thinking like well what has impacted me the most what's changed my life the most and I realized that actually if I really thought about it often would have changed my life the most was like essays people had written and ideas people had shared and I think I met the stage of my life now where I'm I'm actually I have something to say and so I'm I I think of it as from sort of trying to I want to put the Emmett worldview out into the world the way that you know Paul Graham has put the program will be out in the world or taleb has like not just put his worldview on the road but then like condensed it into like sayings that like can that allow other people to like onboard it even if they haven't read all the books and I think of that ambition to like try to try to encode it into a meme almost yeah yeah one can be digested and shared and you know you need the law you need the long form this is great blog post sticking Theory 201 size does matter by Stevia that's about why like the people who change the world with their writing all write really long blog posts and it's basically like you just need some amount of time in someone's head to like we were talking about this earlier like to install your agent voice yeah to install the voice and so you I think I just need to produce a lot of writing and then you also need the pithy summary things which are which both are things the voice can say often in people's heads and also like enable a language for talking about your world view that people who aren't soaking it can like interact with so the people who are like reading you don't sound like crazy people and I think that's the that's sort of what I want to work on next I love that I think that's great do you you said something about Rick Rubin how he's sort of the I don't know how you would describe it it's kind of like curator but almost like a collaborator really with an artist to help them do their great work is Paul Graham the Rick Rubin of the startup world no uh Paul is Paul's more like the um uh Tony Robbins of the not quite so much self-helpie but the main thing that talking to Paul does to you repeatedly is like increase your ambition and drive like and he has good ideas sometimes too like don't get me wrong every now and then Paul's a really genius idea but like mostly what I got out of talking to Paul was not necessarily the great idea that would like change The Treasure of the business but the belief that I could go find it and that I was going to change the world and that I should be what we were doing was important and worth investing in and that I got a bunch of other stuff too but that was so that was singularly so valuable at like over overloads the other things I got out of it how does he do that because you know when you say that my head thinks of like a Tony Robbins like a David Goggins like sort of people that almost like push you but he doesn't seem like that personality and reading all of his essays he's not like that at all so how does he get you to think bigger and push harder without being think bigger push harder right you know what you should do is the classic Paul grahamism um and it's always followed by a thing you could add on to what you're doing to turn it from project a addressing this small thing to Project B changing the you know the universe it's all Transportation we're going to manage power what if you've tried to power all Transportation instead of like building a wheel but that's a surprise you know what you should do you know what you should do is yeah yeah if you talk to Paul you know what you should do you know what you should do that's that that is the consistent policy he I don't say delude because it sounds mean like it's I was like he deludes himself about your business and how great you are and invites you to join him in this deluded vision of like interpreting what you're doing in the biggest best possible light and from that vantage point what you're doing is super like what if it does what if it goes right it's sort of what what he invites you to ask right what if stop stop asking yourself so stop seeing all the hard problems all the you're gonna have to do ask you what if what if what we're doing Works what if it goes right what if it goes right and we like keep going like what could it be and when you spend time there you see how the small things can turn out to be Microsoft was building programming languages for like these hobbyist microcomputers that was a tiny irrelevant Market that turned out to be extremely important and that's generally true of all the big businesses but they what they start out doing the important startups they start up doing something small and that seems almost trivial but there's a way in which this trivial thing can be seen bigger he sees it early no he sees he sees things have nothing to do with the way you'll actually be big early but he sees a bunch of ways you could be big no one can do that no one actually knows if they knew it they just go do then they'd be the the the process the Oracle what did he say let's say for Justin TV or what's up what's one we could beat Reddit or yeah Justin TV I remember we one of them was like you should like go hire all the like reality TV stars and make get them to go beyond Justin TV you could be you could just take over all the unscripted stuff just a terrible idea for a bunch of reasons but like it recontextualized what we were doing for me in terms of like we're not making a on the internet live streaming show we might be building like just the way that you make unscripted entertainment generally and that's like much bigger idea and we were making a calendar and uh for my first startup I remember this you know what you should do is make it like programmable so people can add in and out functionality so it can like talk to your to-do list and your your email and your like everything else in your life and then it could be your counter in some ways like that's everything you're doing what if it was like the central Hub of like your entire online information management system that's also a bad idea like your calendar shouldn't be that but like but like but what if it was and you walk away and and I and implicitly by saying that what he's telling you is I believe you are the kind of Founders who could build an information management system that controls all it takes over people's entire like solves the entire problem for them does their takes over all their information and manages it for them you're not just like building a like Google account like what what you will find out later is a Google Calendar clone before who calendar is launched you're not just building an Outlook clone in JavaScript you're like changing the way people relate to information I'm like is that true it's neither true nor false that's not a true or false statement but it's a way to contextualize what you're doing it's the it's the Sonic superee quote of like don't teach them to like carry wood or build ships teach them to urine for the vast and let's see like Paul teaches you to see how you could be a changer of the world and how what you're doing is part of like this Grand like building of the future and like the ideas I'll repeat here both of those ideas are bad but they were very helpful because they made me feel like what we were doing was important that Paul believed that I could do something big and important and they caused me to even though I want to projecting them look for those ideas like to be open to and looking for because you would get one every like like you'd get like three an hour Paul is a faucet for these it's easy I can do it for startups too now if I want to I learned the track and I should do that more often I'm usually fall into the Tactical stuff but by by having that happen when he once he's once you've rejected 10 of those you can't help but start hearing the Paul you know what you should do in your own head the feeling the ceiling has been raised yes of like well maybe I should recontextualize my to-do list as like an email client like what why is email on to do separate like maybe I should should be building something much bigger than what I'm building and in a way that doesn't require me to change anything maybe what I've built is already almost that if I just like think about it a different way it's this funny balance there actually I had a tweet Thread about this recently between like you know small plans have no priorities German Souls plan big or go home you should be really ambitious and aim super big and like only do projects that are really big could be that you can see being being super big and super important and then the other hand the fundamental truth that like you know big trees grow from small acorns and like most of the many of the best things when they get started the person is not thinking I'm gonna go take over the world they're just trying to do a good thing that like they think is good often just often for themselves even or for like a very small number of other people and then it turns out that that's much much bigger than they realized and and those are both true pieces of advice like different people need to hear in different contexts like but the kind of contradict each other yeah what about these other people so you've you've had a privilege I asked about Paul Graham you've also been friends with you were in the first YC batch so you're friends with Reddit guys I think you know the Carlson brothers Sam Altman let's give me like a rapid fire on on them of like what makes them unique like he said about Paul what what his kind of superpower is what really stands out what's something you admire about the way he does things give me one about maybe uh Steve from Reddit yeah so like it's easier and sometimes with Paul because like he was a mentor to me right and Steve was much more like my it's almost like my brother in startups right growing up with Paul I know I know the things that he like taught me because it was much more of an explicit like I was being taught by Paul with Steve it's like I learned things from him by like watching and imitating I think like I actually learned a lot from Steve on management by watching his kind of unflappability like Steve is not like an unpassionate person I'm like well what can get angry or it can get sad or whatever but like when there's a crisis happening or there's just I've said I got to Shadow him for a day and when bad news is delivered he responded he wasn't like moved he was like still grounded and response that to that thing and was curious asked questions like didn't jump to what to do about it but then also like ended the meeting with like all right well here's what we should do here's what we're gonna do and like it was just sort of a master class like this is this is when you when something someone brings something up it's got to be anxiety provoking it's like bad news that's what it looks like when a leader is engaged but not like not activated and like I think I in my own leadership to sometimes success and sometimes failure I think try to imitate that when I receive that you know when I have something like that in that state when you say you shattered and what was that like you guys just said we exchanged like like going to each other's offices and like sitting through each like early on or like maybe like five years ago four years ago it was really cool what do I do with Justin me Justin and Steve all like shout out each other um it was pretty fun I learned a lot that's incredible to like go watch another CEO at work and like you have to have the I don't know how you have the kind of like trust relationship to make that happen without like knowing someone for 15 years uh and I happen to have the privilege to like know a bunch of CEOs for a really long time and getting to go Shadow each other was like uh real learning thing what do you think even if these people didn't let's say explicitly teach you things you know I like you know if I read a biography or whatever one of the things I always try to figure out is more like to what extent is this person sort of built different or operates differently than like even somebody who's very good like the difference between very good and sort of like the elite what is the the best of the best at this craft versus somebody who's very good certainly very good but just not the same what is those like the diff is what I'm always most interested in I'm curious you've been around a lot of these like high performing even like you know yeah Bezos you've interact with him like do you notice any of these diffs or does is it all just like it's hard it's hard to say like that I I think I believe more in contextualization like like that I see people do really amazing at something but like when it's especially when it's your own company there's a lot of like you happen to fit this problem well and it's not General I don't know how to generalize it I don't know I don't know of anyone else even performing at this problem the CEO of stripe job is a very specific job and Patrick's amazing at it would he be equally amazing at some other CEO job possibly but I've never seen him do that I've never seen anyone else because you have stripe and it's very hard for me to is it true at the beginning like is it true is like like startup founder of ambitious company are those are those stripe different at that stage too or like yeah no absolutely the people who are really good you can sense the energy and the drive and the capability and just the pace there's like it tends to like stuff happens a lot but like usually but then not always like some problems don't actually give weight like stripe is a good example of a company that gives way to a high energy High Pace thing because it's it's a simple problem at some level that has infinite details as it could be right but I think like I don't know if that approach would work as well if you're trying to create open AI or anthropic where it's a research oriented organization and you kind of have to be a little more patient and forcing it's impossible and so I I really believe in like fit the different people are good at different things and like obviously someone's a plus Patrick's obviously a plus it being a stripe CEO and it's just hard to tell the reasons which these things are transferable we don't really know but actually one thing did come to mind about this question in terms of like a capability that I do think is generic that I did see Bezos exhibit where I was like oh that's a thing that I'm good at but he is better at that I'm better than most people but he's better than me which is we present him on Twitch probably twice a year once or twice a year for the first three four years I was at Amazon and every time two things would happen first of all he would remember everything we told him the first meeting and I don't think he was like reviewing extensive notes someone else took because I don't know when he would have the time to do that I observed him going from meeting to meeting and he did not review notes I think he just remembered at least the high points and the other thing was consistently he would read our plan and he would then ask a question about why we didn't do a certain thing or give us an idea for a thing we could do that I hadn't thought of before once it's a bunch of things I had usually and then at least once which is hard to do because all you do is think about this company never happens most people would be lucky to get one of those one ever let alone one a year would be great like if you did it once a year or even once every three years right he could just like you just generate them and they were and they were not all bad ideas either they were new ideas but a thing I had I generate a lot of ideas to get a new idea I haven't thought thought of on a topic I've been thinking about for a decade that might even be a good idea that is like he's just really smart as far as I can tell like I don't know how he does that can you say a story of one of those as like the statue of limitations passed at least five years ago I'm trying to remember okay honestly I I don't remember the specifics anymore I just remember the like the like what the moment like because the first time I was just like oh he's smart like he's seeing twitch for the first time A lot of times smart people have a one good idea about your business the first time they see it because they have this huge history and they're pattern matching you to some historical thing they've seen and like that combination yields one new insight but then he did it the second time remember the second hour I was just like what is going on this doesn't make any sense like nope I've never had that experience before ever Andy does not have the new idea generation capability the same way but he does have the like remember what you told him thing which is also extremely impressive like that's that's and Andy has this other thing he can do that I think is another and he also has a it's easier for me with people I've like reported to or I've learned this apparently yeah yeah and it has this like ability to criticize you in a way that conveys 100 percent I know that you're amazing I know that your plan is good or you know like or that your Achilles capable of making a really good plan I know that you're working really hard and I know that you are smart and you have a great team and we have a huge opportunity and yet somehow your results are which must I don't know what's wrong but we're in this together and we're gonna like I've I have your back but like I but I'm confused like why aren't the results better given how amazing you are and you feel supported like you feel like he he believes in you but but like but he's just he's you're so sad oh I'm sorry I'm confused I'm sorry I've failed even though I clearly can succeed at this I'm gonna go I'm gonna go like fix this now and like it's almost like instead of looking at this and then judging you he comes to your side of the table says what is this yeah like how did we wind up you're like how I have failed you that I didn't say something earlier like something I don't know but like not no way and that can come off for some people when they do that it comes off as insincere or it comes off as like they don't think you're actually competent like how did I not catch this can come off as I don't blame you because you're clearly not good enough to have caught this like he realized how did we how did we wind up here I know that we are working together we're on the same team how did we wind up with not the results we wanted with a plan that I thought we both thought seemed good like help me understand and because it because it is genuine it's super effectively so expect them I don't know it's super effective on me and I saw it be effective on other people as well so I know it works on some number of people right and that's another those things I've tried I've tried to become good at I'm not I'm not as good at it as Andy is but I've certainly gotten better it's only something to learn from that's great love that one dude thanks for doing this I know I've been I've been bothering you to do this for a long time because I I love hearing your stories love hearing the way you think it's very different than most people I've run into even here in Silicon Valley where you're supposed to have this kind of very unique diverse set of Minds you know you're you're one of them you're one of the reasons I moved out to San Francisco was to meet people like you so thanks for doing this thank you I really appreciate that yeah it's a beautiful and I really appreciate being able to tell in the podcast foreign [Music]

and that's how we grew and that's why I tell people I say to blog I don't actually mean blog but I meant create bangers text based bangers uh on a consistent basis and get people to love your free content enough to subscribe TBB baby text based bangers that's been our strategy right like how' [Music] you all right we're live can I tell you about a few interesting pieces of content I've consumed lately and I want to hear what you've consumed yeah let's do it the info diet section the info diet section yeah let me tell you the first one so I have been on a Scott Galloway kick Scott Galloway um has a podcast and I think that's what he's more famous for than anything but he uh uh he started a few companies but he's got this U like one of his companies L2 I think it sold for like 200 million it was like nine figures he dude he did this podcast called Scott's personal finance I found it on YouTube where he talks about like money and and like how much money he has and what's he spend spends it on and he like he's like this is all going to sound douchy but I'll tell you he's like basically I'm worth at least $100 million he goes he goes I made it into the nine figures recently he said I'm still incredibly anxious about money it stems from childhood he's like we were just poor and I'm super anxious about it but then he goes he does something cool he says two things that are interesting one he goes I'm spending between $200,000 and $400,000 a month and I moved to Europe and the guy was like why would you move to Europe he goes well America's the best place to make money and Europe's the best place to spend it love that that's great yeah it was awesome he goes he goes look what I've realized is that I'm I'm getting older I don't have a lot of time to live maybe I have 40 more years or something like that to live I'm gonna spend it and I'm G to enjoy the hell out of it he's goes it feels incredibly masculine for me to be able to provide these experiences for my family and I'm doing it he says I spend around $1 to $200,000 a month now on travel we fly private we went to the World Cup I brought my uh I brought uh another couple in their family just because I wanted to we paid for the whole thing and he goes through this like really like detailed thing about um spending his money and another interesting thing he said and I want to ask this about you so he has had I think three companies of which one was like a very big success and that it probably made him $50 million but he said I've made more money being on board on the boards of companies and the equity that they've given me than actual actually building companies and what I'm surprised about is what he said is that I've made more money doing not my main thing or at least what I thought was going to be my main thing doing these like ancillary things uh has that proven to be true in your career yet 100% um I wouldn't say more yet but I've definitely seen examples of that so I'll give you a very simple example of my life and I'll tell you one that was from a recent episode so um in my life I've I started an e-commerce company maybe e-commerce brand three years ago roughly I can't tell you how many hours I've spent on this e-commerce thing like it takes a lot of time to build a real company that actually has you know real revenues real profits that are significant and there's a physical product tons of energy goes into it I have pulled out zero dollars and zero cents from this business now the business makes a lot of money right we're tens of millions of dollars in Revenue but I pull out $ zerar it all gets reinvested and all my time gets invested into this thing and it is very uh labor intensive so I haven't made much money from this but one thing that did happen was along the way I was like ah such a pain like I'm always on my phone you know like often if you message me I'll be like oh yeah I'll send it to you when I'm back at my computer they like I'm not just like at my computer a lot and um I wanted to be able to check on my my my store from my phone and the Shopify app doesn't really make that very easy like you can get in you can maybe see your Revenue but you don't know how your ad are doing you don't know how your Amazon store is doing you don't know how your Google accounts doing uh you don't know how your clayo emails are working and so meet these two uh you know two two Jewish guys who are like hey we made this thing that's like a mobile um mobile way to manage your storefront for any Ecom brand they're like a we have an Ecom brand we built this thing for us and I use it I'm like oh this is great and uh I'm like okay I'd like to invest and they're like oh cool like you know I think I maybe the first investor maybe second something like that very cheap like $5 million valuation or something like that do you remember what you put in $75,000 to um a company called triple whale was that all your money uh no this all my investments have to go through the fund unless it's like um something that like wouldn't be eligible for the fund but this would because otherwise it's like a bias thing so put it in from the fund um so put this money in and I'm like uh great I hope this does well but I'm not sure it seems like you know maybe just an analytics widget I don't know it might not be the biggest thing in the world but I I think it's really useful for me I think other store owners will find it useful start telling other owners about it blah blah blah this company's now worth hundreds of millions of dollars so you know on a five million doll valuation entry point you know we're up 40x or something like that uh you know 30 40 50x somewhere in that range so you know SE take $75,000 and multiply by by let's just take 40x for a second it's three million three million bucks now of course it's the fund so you know my carry on that 20% um you know but it's also not done this is just like you know a couple years in if this becomes a two billion doll company um you know I there's it's easy to see that I will have made more and and by the way I invested in six other e-commerce SAS tools it's like oh sales tax is a pain in the ass cool let me use numeral for that this is like a new startup that's doing making it easy for e-com owners to a sales tax oh I need uh bookkeeping and accounting let's use final Loop instead of QuickBooks it's like I started investing in a bunch of these whatever thought was the best tool after I did the research I was like well I'm not just going to be a user I'm also going to be an investor and I just did that across the board and a lot of these are are huge now postcript for for text message like what Ronda Sanz is using for his text messaging I don't know what he's using but probably should be using postcript because it's the like the best way to send SMS marketing and you just invest in these because you're a user but like I've made more money investing in e-commerce SAS tools than I've made from my store and the store took all of my time and these other on took one hour of emails to back and forth to just do the investment and that's like you know not what I would have expected going in however had I not done the e-commerce thing I would have never understood the value of these tools or been able to see them early or been able to be like hey let me in and I'll introduce you to hundred other people that have stores because I'm in that Network now and so you made money in this like not what you plan to make money you made money in this other weird way same way Scott Galloway didn't make you know he makes the money in his company but then his reputation is where he gets paid to be on boards way easier and more money especially when you count dollars per hour I give you another example we just did a podcast with uh Samir from col and Samir and in that he talks about like they got their start doing something that like nobody would look at it be like this is a good business plan he was like we're gonna basically I think they were fans of Lacrosse or La they were lacrosse players or something and they created like a lacrosse Sports commentary Network on YouTube it's like niche of a niche of a niche and they did this pretty early on YouTube and honestly it didn't work that well but it did two things it taught them about YouTube and making videos and now their YouTube channel is like million subscribers it's a you know it's a multi-million dollar brand easily um so that taught them that but also when they were doing that when they were uh following the lacrosse scene they saw this one guy he was the best lacrosse player in the country and he's like wanted to go pro but there's like no Pro scene for lacrosse you get paid nothing and so he's like dude if I go pro I make $35,000 a year this sucks he like screw it i'm GNA to make my own lacrosse league and this guy created his own Lacrosse League well guess who became the first investor in the lacrosse league Samir um because and he he's like I didn't have a lot of money I put in whatever I don't know what it was let's pretend it's 10 grand but like that lacrosse league is now worth hundreds of millions of dollars and he got into the very beginning so like in this weird way he's gonna make he'll probably make more have made more from that one investment than all of the YouTube action he was trying to do along the way but it only would have happened by being in the game and getting giving yourself that opportunity to get lucky I think it's called The Arena it's being in the arena showard for brown guys like me to say the arena I don't want to get get caught in that fire um you could say that he's in the arena um that's good and and by the way that podcast was great um the second thing that I've consumed lately I've been reading like crazy so you um you and Andrew kind of got me turn on this I hate I don't really love love investing but I uh wanted to to learn more about it and so I read Warren Buffett's biography not the one snowball that's too long it's like a thousand Pages this one's called making of the making of an American capitalist have you ever read uh anything about Buffet uh I back in the day like 10 years ago I read a Buffett book but I don't really remember it to be honest man I didn't know anything about I didn't really know anything about him but there's a few traits about him that are crazy the one like he's got like this a shuck demeanor like I'm from the Midwest like what do I know you know I just super charismatic he could be president yeah yeah well it's mostly kind of [ __ ] in a sense like the guy's a genius like he's like the 1% the 1% in terms of IQ in terms of horsepower and there's this crazy de uh this crazy story where he's like helping to buy I think it's Solomon Brothers or no sorry it's ABC uh so he's buying ABC for multi-billions of dollars and he's sitting at his desk and they're like all right let's work out the deal he goes oh no let's just work it out right now like and he's like well what about your analysts like where are they he goes I'm the computer it's all here and he doesn't have a calculator he doesn't have anything like that he's like let's just we're going to do the deal right now um and I can just do it in my head and he just memorizes all these their annual reports and all their numbers and then he like does the math in their head he's like if I Warren goes if I can't do the math in my head um then I I don't understand this deal and I probably shouldn't do it so his IQ is crazy the second thing is that his discipline is super strong so before he had birkshire hathway he had a fund with like I think it started with like 100 Grand or something not substantial but was growing 30% a year and he did that for like 10 years and in the 60s he just shut it down and they're like why are you shutting this down he's like well I just don't see any good opportunities right now you know I like I said I'm I'm looking for good opportunities I don't see any right now so I'm just going to shut this down and so he just doesn't he quit investing had a little mini retirement he's incredibly disciplined and then the last thing is that uh he has super high integrity so like he's only sued someone one time and that time was when he gave a guy a a charity $25,000 and the guy robbed him of the and he didn't actually provide the charitable work that's the only time he sued someone and there was another time where he was being investigated by the Senate they thought that he was insider trading because um he did a few things that were like smart and he just made the right calls and after investigating him for two or three years they're like hey do you want to like join this committee on like fraud because you're really smart and you're like the most honest guy we've met and he joined the committee there's another time where he wants to uh he's like in this country club and he's like hey why don't we let Jewish people in this country club this is pretty ridiculous and he's like and the guys were like look the Jews have their own thing they have their own country club it's 100% Jewish let the Jews go there so instead of putting up a fuss about it he goes and joins the Jewish Country Club he goes hey they uh integrate and they let non-jews into their thing I think we should do that to our thing and that's like how he goes about doing stuff he's like not confrontational but he's like pretty slick um and then the last thing I guess is he basically for the first like 40 years of his career he only read annual reports and that's how he got his information so people are like how are you so good and he's like dude I just read like five annual reports a day and all the information that I'm using he's like I don't even have a computer I don't have a terminal all the information that I use any one of you out there can go to a library and get that same information so super unique guy so I've been very fascinated with him but he's got one downside do you know what is you know he's like a a a [ __ ] family man right right yeah he uh he has a very weird a strange family Dynamic so what Happ so he got divorced yeah but then she didn't get divorced so his wife Susie they she was like a hippie and for some reason he was into that and they were married and he loved her and everything but she was one day she goes you know Warren I just want to go off to San Francisco and I want to do my own thing but we're not going to get a divorce and he's like all right cool and she goes also I have my friend named astred she's going to come over and take care of you I thought sister it's not her sister it's just a friend it was it was a like someone she was friendly with okay and so within a week of ASD taking care of Buffett of waren they are like lovers and like she moves in and they like date however like they're all friends with each other and so Susie is like hey as I think you should redecorate the house from when I did it it's getting a little old like she gives her tips on taking care of him and then like when Buffett has to go to like these big like presidential public meetings where he's meeting with senate or whatever Susie comes when he when she wants when he wants go and do like some local stuff or like some some uh stuff that doesn't require a lot of press ASD comes and they take turns and every once in a while if it's like a really big thing they'll both go and they'll team up and they'll support him it's very interesting and it's very strange but he's not a very present father and he's super [ __ ] cheap with his kid so there was a time when his daughter was living in a really crappy apartment and she had just had a baby and this one of Buffett's friends goes to check on her and the daughter can barely see the TV because it's a little small black and white TV and the friend goes Warren you should buy her a big screen TV man she has had a baby she's sitting in this shitty apartment just buy her a [ __ ] TV and he wouldn't do it he didn't want to buy her a TV and it like it took him convincing to he's like I don't want to spoil them and so he's really cheap and like it didn't seem like the best father I like that there's one thing I always remember about Buffett that uh or like two things that I really like about Buffett I have a whole uh doc that I keep called buffe isms and because he has this skill of telling like these like tiny stor these little Parables that are both funny and interesting and then make his point for him and I just feel like he's got an arsenal of these and so I've been I like I don't read a lot of his books but I watch a lot of his talks and I watch a lot of their like annual shareholder meetings um to try to find these little little phrases he uses that I am like oh this guy's so Charming but also he's he does a great job of making his point using that um another one another thing I like about Buffett is he said one thing once that really stuck with me he go goes um the stock market like people like why don't more people get rich he goes because they don't really understand how the game works he goes um the best rule of this entire game in this with the stock market is that you don't have to play um he's like um most people's problem is that they just do too many things they make too many Investments they buy and sell too many things and they feel constantly compelled to like come to an answer on should they or shouldn't they do X and he's like um you really just have to sit and wait for the fat pitch you just don't have to do you don't have to swing that's where you got your fat pitch thing yeah exactly there are no called strikes in um in investing like you could sit there all day and just watch pitches go by and just wait for the fat pitch the problem is people suck at waiting and that really stood out to me because I'm somebody who historically is very bad at waiting I'm a very impulsive impatient person it serves you well as an entrepreneur to be very impatient you take a bunch of action as an investor impatience and impulsiveness is a terrible trait so as I've shifted my career to go from entrepreneur to investor I had to ask myself you what do I need to relearn what do I need to unlearn uh what served me as an entrepreneur that's not going to serve me as an investor and let me make that that conscious switch and that was one of the the key switches that I realized I had to make and I just and and I agree that's a that's a a really good lesson and I think he stole that from um Teddy Williams like a famous baseball player who hit lots of home runs and he like Teddy Williams made this like graph he just it was a strike zone so it was just a and he's like look my batting average if I hit a pitch in this bottom corner is pretty low I might make connection with the with the pitch it might be a strike but my batting average is low I sh I really shouldn't even swing at that pitch even though it's a strike he's like I'm looking for stuff in The Sweet Spot because here I'm over 400 right so he has Ted Williams has the greatest batting average ever and one of the reasons why was he was more disciplined than others in what pitches he would swing at he would really wait for those fat pitches whereas most batters get quite impatient and start just hacking at everything but my issue with Warren's advice on that stuff was all right well what's a good pitch look like and so I ordered this book that's gonna it's like they didn't make a lot of copies of it but so I had to find it on Amazon uh and it's gonna take like two or three weeks to come but it's um I like how you just said Amazon like it's like some Niche bookstore you went to oh it's hard to find I had to go to amazon.com to find it it's this little book this little mom and pop Boutique um but they uh they anal all of his deals and they write out what he saw in them because I'm trying to figure out okay you're telling me what a bad one looks like what's a good one look like and so that's some of the content that I've been consuming um it's been good I've been reading like a book or two a week it's because Kindle you read on Kindle ever yeah yeah that's all I read on pretty much I'll I I start on Kindle and then if I like the book I'll order the hard cover so that I have it around the house to just remember it pick it up whenever I want but I start on Kindle well they have this like percentage bar at the bottom where it says what percentage of the book that you've read and I'm like I'm going to get through 20% every night and uh it's been awesome so shout out to kindall you got you nailed it gamified your ass um okay so let me let me tell you two things that are interesting one uh the content I consumed uh so I listened to this podcast by our friend uh David senra I don't know that that well I hung out with him one time and um he's he's a total nut in the best way like uh he's a thousand miles a minute but I want to share with you he did a pod the other day that I thought it was really good called uh I think it was called the greatest interview I've ever done and it was basically some it was uh Patrick ranesi interviewing him they're like what did you notice about a lot you've studied all these great men and history right you you read these biographies and what are some common things that you see he goes the story of the sun uh the story of the sun is uh begins at the end of the story of the father so basically like uh embedded in the story of the son is the story of the father and he's like this is very very common whether the father was great in all these ways often you'll see the son take a totally different approach or if the father was limiting or hard ass or uh really brutal in one way the son takes that trauma and basically uses it in in what they do and I thought that was pretty cool second thing he said about reading that I really liked he goes um they go do you reread books and he goes yeah of course I love rereading books reread books all the time and uh you know I think a common thing would be like oh isn't that kind of a waste to like read what you've already read it's like you know you've already read that book it's the same thing why not read something new and he said it really well he goes I read books like several years apart often and he goes um the words are the same but I've changed he's like you know I'm a different guy than I was when I first read that book so the second time I read it I've had years of life experience I've read a hundred other books I've had all these these things that I've done in my life and now the same words mean something totally different to me or I have elevated understanding or memor memory or different thing stands out to me I thought that was a really great Insight on rereading because I'm a big fan of rereading like I'd rather find a great thing and soak in it versus trying to just move on to the next and count the number of books I can read in a year and um I thought the re that that point he brought up is one that I I really never uh never heard I also thought that he did an amazing job of almost like building his like person story so he said it really well why did you start doing this like why did you start this um this whole thing where you're reading all these books and you're doing this podcast like how did you even have the the inspiration for that he goes look uh man my my childhood was not the best like I grew up and uh my parents did their best but they weren't necessarily the best he goes I you know I'm the only person in my family to ever graduate from high school and he's like I wanted to be successful but everywhere I looked around me all I saw was the wrong answer all I saw was what not to do I didn't read just to as a hobby for fun I read because I was looking for the answers I wanted to know what what to do because all I saw in my life was what not to do that's what led me to reading the biographies of the greatest people he goes I have spent the last you know whatever 10 years of my life having one-way conversations with the greatest people ever to live on this Earth and he goes that's what I think about reading he goes I think reading is having a one-way conversation with the greatest people on Earth and he goes and he goes and the you know the podcast people are like why' you podcast I don't know man I didn't even start it he goes this is just an obsession I am just studying these people I needed a way to put it put my thoughts down he goes this is an obsession disguised as a podcast and I loved it I was like wow he good these are great little on line he's very lyrical with it and so um I'm very impressed by David C I think he's doing a great job and uh yeah this it was it was it was a fun fun thing to to consume I I joked with them I was like you know like David there I got turned off on reading a lot of these books for a while because I would listen to him on Audible and I had my favorite narrators and I would go like oh I love this guy's voice what else did he read this uh narrate and this guy has read like a thousand narrated a thousand books and I'm like how the [ __ ] is this guy still a narrator what' you think if you read all these business books he would be way more successful that's that's kind of what I'm bring it up here like I love the way he phrases things I think it's really compelling I actually don't agree with him that like you're not actually having one-way conversations with the greatest people on Earth it's not like you needed to do all of that to be successful actually you should probably just get out there and do some things right like I actually could argue a bunch of the other sides but what's the point the fact that he believes that is going to lead him to a really great and successful place um I don't subscribe to all his thoughts but I am a fan of his level of intensity and conviction in himself and what he's doing in California uh like I think in the 90s they banned weightlifting in the prisons cuz they're like holy [ __ ] we're building super criminals these guys are getting yolked they're like too big and uh they're like they're they're surrounded by other criminals they could like talk about like the best way to do stuff and now they're and now they're [ __ ] bench pressing 500 lounds these are super criminals we got to get rid of them David is like becoming a Super criminal a little bit he's like one of the guys who's like reading it and like just cranking away he's plotting David's plotting dude there's a I feel like I could be like hey David um he's sitting there reading a book I'm like David you like that book he's like [ __ ] love this book what do you are you joking me and I'm like David in this room right over here Heidi Clum is standing there naked she's surrounded by all the best desserts you could ever eat Michelin star desserts the the music it's the greatest music you've ever heard all of the unreleased Drake albums are are in here they the you know it's the best music it's the best party there's no other guys in here just all naked supermodels and um David the best part is when you walk in you become a billionaire and I think he'd be like he wouldn't have even heard anything he'd just be turning the page to the next next face like this guy doesn't want to do anything he would have licked his fingers and just look back down just heard the page the silence chump I'm reading and that's the best compliment and the best insult I can give him at the same time like I think it is amazing that he is that way that he's he really feels like this is the best thing that anyone could possibly do he can't believe nobody else is doing this he doesn't it's like this is the the the peak of the peak of life experience I'm inspired by him anything else that you've consumed that you like uh not a but I have a different um so in the way that I'm like by the way I hope he doesn't take offense I'm joking about some of these things but like yeah I'm a huge fan of fan of his stuff and I think he does an amazing job and I have no vested interest in his success except for I think he's really cool and I think he does a great job I appreciate his craft and he's one of the few pods that I like listen to on a regular basis it's quite good yeah that was like a genuine endorsement it's called Founders by the way the Pod is called Founders so we'll give him a we'll give him some love the other thing that uh so I'm so the other interesting experience I had was I Rec I'm drawn to people like him people who are slightly extreme who are obsessed who have a independent mindedness they're deciding how they want to live life and they their rubric of success is different than others right that's what I just described about him that I like um Ben had a meeting with somebody and he comes back he calls me oh dude I bet this guy he's great he's doing this thing um and then he just kept say he like said two or three times like really great guy and I'm like I I was like man why is he such a great guy like um you're only there for 45 minutes like you know what do you mean by that why did you you kept saying I really liked him I really liked him I really like what he's doing I go do you really like what he's doing or you really like him he goes I think I really like him I go let me guess was he high energy when he talked a nice guy like simple not didn't intimidate You by kind of being a hard ass about anything and uh did he teach you one or two interesting things during the conversation he goes bingo I I know Ben because that's your archetype of what you really like that's why you really like me I'm a high energy guy um I'm I'm a nice guy I don't like you know I don't like kind of push people into a place that they feel uncomfortable um and I'll usually if you talk to me for an hour you're G to learn one or two things that's why we get along and um I said you know one thing we should do as again how do you become a great how do you shift from operator to maybe spending spending more time investing is I think we gotta uh investigate what are our bias and our blind spots so basically we made a little list of what's the personality archetype I am rationally drawn towards for me it's the David senra types it's the slightly extreme uncomfortable ambition around their thing independent mindedness um obsession with their craft I am drawn to that I will make mistakes you know it's like a girl who's like ah you know he's a six but he's wearing a leather jacket it's like it just does something to me I gotta go for him like that's what I'm drawn to and I was like on the other side what what can't I stand somebody who's just dry if you have no sense of humor if you're dry like you could be the smartest guy in the world sitting on a gold mine of a business if you're boring like within five minutes I'm like this guy sucks I'm out and um you know I'm just like who's an example of that like a famous person well dude I'm not trying to make a you know trying to famous like a like a or like a someone who you've read about let's see a public person I don't know off the top of my head do you have one who's just dry I mean um there's like a bunch of like famous investors and [ __ ] who like I've read about and I'm like this is news Fest um like yeah there probably just like some I don't know Enterprise stas or these people who are like yeah we just make the best um or like you know we just provide uh solid procurement services to others right it's like I don't know like they don't have a lot of hobbies yeah like do you love that like no but I we we service a need and it's like cool like so like what are some of the cool growth hacks you've been doing they're like well we don't really need growth hacks we grow 17% year over year it's like uh we just really need to do solid operations it's like oh okay I I just I need to get out of this conversation right now like I'm I feel itchy like I got to get out of here whenever I read about like hedge fun guys I'm like this is a snoozefest dude you're just like this like when they do like a lot of like Fast trading unless they're kind of like a criminal and kind of doing drugs then I'm in all way I'm always down with like I love a good Crime Story unless you're driving your your successful life off a cliff I'm out yeah yeah I need some drama but like whenever I read about like hedge fun guys I'm like dude you're just play on Excel all day I don't find that enjoyable to hear about but I think I think it is useful it was useful exercise for us to do which was what do you irrationally drawn towards that you should probably like Dial A Down discount be able to apply a discount after the fact when you're when when when you're out of heat and then what do you have an irrational distaste for where you're going to underprice or underestimate somebody and actually you shouldn't be um people have been talking about like bias and like the stuff like but like they always came at it from Like A diversity and inclusion point of you um for me I you know like sure that's fine but I've never been like drawn to like you know I've never been drawn to spending a bunch of time thinking about that however for this I immediately saw for myself oh yeah I could see myself making mistakes being overly generous towards a certain personality type you say the certain certain three key phrases and I'm all in um and I'm I'm I'm kind of repelled from these things even though I really shouldn't be it's actually like I don't need to be your friend I just like if I'm investing in you I don't need to think you're cool and want to hang with you I just need to be able to to understand what you're doing and invest in it um do you uh do you feel like you have the same thing do you have a a thing you're drawn to like I feel like one of yours I'll just say it out loud is I feel like you're drawn to people who are very meticulous and orderly in the way they operate like if somebody's got like a system and like they're a stickler for the details I feel like in your like they go up 100 points in your book whereas for me that doesn't really do it that does it for me because I envy that because that that's not my natural you know like my wife is like like that like I'm drawn to people who are like orderly and systematic and disciplined like people who wake up at 5:00 a.m. every morning that's not me and so like I'm really fascinated by people who like grind really hard and are systematic and are operational and things like that uh i' I I get a lot of Joy being around those people because I'm not like that can I tell you real quick about a cool thing because I feel like we did a bunch of uh fluffy stuff today okay I got to get a rant off my chest um people are really drawn to things that highly tactical or or um highly like specific um versus and complex versus things that are simple but might be a little bit um Airy let me give you an example when I was in LA we did a bunch of those dinners with Founders and I think I said this in my debrief but I'll I'll point out again um people the the conversation when inevitably go like you have a bunch of people who all sold their company everybody's everybody in the in the thing is you know Successful by traditional measures and the conversation would always gravitate towards two subjects like kind of Health and Longevity uh or just like kind of like being happy being a happier person some sort of like life quality of life Improvement rich guy problems rich guy [ __ ] because like oh I've already made it but yeah this I feel like I'm not as happy as I thought it would be so then what uh you know like and the longevity health things gives them a new like the carrot to Chase and they kind of feel like they neglected it while running their company and the life quality everybody actually just wants a high quality of life they just don't know how to ask the questions around it um and what you would see was two things somebody would say uh something like that was just like simple and useful they'd be like yeah you know I just like I'm um you know before bed I don't really use my phone I just actually kind of review the day and think about like you know how I did and what you know just in general like my interactions of the day what I might have done differently and like you know um and I'm like oh I do that too it's I have this thing called revision and it's like I just kind of see the day events of my day and I just go back and just play them out a little differently in my head it's really useful and people are like like the reaction to something like that if you just kind of tell people like hey you know here's a simple thing you could do imagine what you want and what it would feel like to have it or um think about how your day went and just be kind of mindful and thoughtful about like you know versus just uh always on to the next thing um and the reaction I would get would be like cool and the cool is kind of like cool good for you like um I ain't doing that [ __ ] uh like you know don't tell me to be alone with my thoughts and um then somebody would be like yeah you know I really I was feeling kind of you know I've just been feeling like I'm in a funk and so I started taking you know six milligrams of low do no Tru alone and then people like what what what what is it what is it called and they're like getting their every literally everyone gets their phone out they start what is it called how do you spell that I'm like are you just gonna take this random drug this person you've never met and they'd be like how many milligrams was that five is five what they say where do you get it can I order right now before I leave this dinner and I'm like y'all [ __ ] are crazy why are people so raed to the pill the the the complex thing you can't even pronounce that just might do it for you vers or you know they'd be like yeah I I hired this um you know this functional cognitive coach and they'd be like what's his name does he take more clients I here's the money like I'm like bro have you tried like [ __ ] writing down like you know your thoughts for a second like nobody wants the simple thing like nobody wants OB thing I just thunk it up I just I just I just Thun in my bed and it worked D I was like hey here's what I do um you know when I go into a situation instead of just reacting like oh it's kind of cold out here so I'm uncomfortable now I feel bad I'm you I'm a little bit bothered by that I just decide before I go in like you know what I want to have a um I want to have a like like a playful experence I want to have a laughing experience right now and then I'll just like I was like I decide that then I go in and I and I have that I look for those moments and I create that experience myself it's pretty amazing you could just do this you could just decide what experience you want and then go have it and they're like is there okay can the next person say like a pill that I could take like some new neut Tropic that's G to help me like they're like all all right CH but can I put that in my body intravenously like is does it come with needles or do I buy them I'm just like y'all are insane you're insane or this guy's like uh he's like uh you know I um I really want to like what's that you know this equipment oh I bought all this exercise equipment i'm like [ __ ] do you walk and do you even have 30 minutes a day he's like no no I don't exercise I don't have time but I bu I'm building out this home gym and I'm building it out and like like you know you could just do push-ups on the floor right you don't have to first buy $10,000 of equipment before you can work out like there's there's no gate to to pass you just you could literally just do 10 things 10 push-ups right now in fact let's do that right now and uh people are not ready for simple action that doesn't require like a Magic Bullet solution and um it noys the hell out of me I'm like are you guys in is everybody around me insane that's how I feel well like when people say magic pill I definitely automatically get interested because like I would like that like why don't they say shortcuts like it's a bad thing but it's like yeah I mean if I can get to my destination shorter and faster I'm in thing they're not even shortcuts literally this [ __ ] that I was talking about this lowd do [ __ ] whatever it's called n Drax Salone no dra I don't know what it was because guess what I don't care don't need it but I was like I was like so does this work like if you felt like an amazing difference the person was like no you have to take it for six months first for your body to acclimate I'm like you're getting hosed like okay honestly I don't know what this drug does maybe it's useful maybe it's a specific thing I'm kind of jokes aside but I for that person who you know got it prescribed maybe they needed it for the other eight bastards in the at the dinner who were like immediately trying to order it I was like y'all don't need this like you don't need that right now that is not the answer to whatever you're whatever hole you're trying to fill right now like there is no chance that that is the correct First Step you should be taking well I think we talked about like the different types of procrastination like the good there's actually good types of procrastination which is like uh like the forgetful scientist who like forgets to like shower or like put on the right pair of socks it's like Ah that's all right he's doing the big things right that's okay and then there's like the bad type which is like making PL that don't need to be planned or like buying domain names or like going back and color coding it afterwards like dude it's okay like yeah or like in in this case it's like buying pills when it's like just 10,000 steps a day will will do the trick as well um but that's pretty funny that's a good story I I uh I would have liked to have seen you in that room yeah I I was just like you guys are nuts U but okay now to satisf I like this stuff though I like this stuff by the way I like this stuff uh me most because tactics change strategies don't you know what I'm saying like I like talking about strategy sometimes our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better dude have you been following the presidential debates and campaign stuff that's going on did you watch Republican debate I watched the the clips the so everyone is it seems like the viic is uh wow there's two ways to say his name that and one is the right one one is the wrong one and you just came with a third Vic holy holy wow it's v i v k right VI is is the way you say so some people say V Vic and you went you went I don't even know where you just went dude that's like correcting me if I say it like Lady Gaga so are you a big Lady Gaga fan I mean come on he was like he was like the star of the debate um because he's just look at him the guy's like a debate Champion it's like what this guy's trained to do um but he's still pulling like you know I don't know 10% or something like that so I think it's all I mean I think Donald Trump's gonna win uh but I did want to tell you a funny thing that I remembered when I watched that debate you watched it oh I love watching I don't care about politics but I love watching fights I would not have uh thought that I love the debates I love the strategy of the debates I love watching it's it's content creation I just love watching the strategy that these guys take into it I couldn't care less about who gets picked couldn't care less about their policies because they don't care about their policies as far as I'm concerned um to me it's a popularity contest and I like to see who markets themselves better uh I think there's a lot to learn from that but one of the things that's uh I remembered was back in the day um I was working at Monkey Inferno and I used to work for a guy named Michael Burch and Michael Burch is a very interesting guy he has built and sold multiple companies so he sold bio famously for $850 million he which him and his wife owned it so they got they own almost whole thing yeah so it was a huge exit for husband and wife couple before that he had built another social network sold for a few you know single digigit millions of dollars so he kind of made one sold it for few million bucks then as soon as a non-compete ended he created it again he's like oh now I know what I should have done the first time and that became the $850 million ex but he also created birthday alarm which is a a company that had millions of dollars in cash flow every year so he had had multiple uh wins very interesting guy but ever since the big bio acquisition he created this idea lab but he kind of transitioned to a different phase of Life almost he was like you know I'm not like you know what do I care it's sort of like yeah I Angel invest but like you know does it really matter like kind of already won the money game in a way right he wouldn't say that but you could just tell it's not like his heart was in that is he a billionaire at this point you think even that he's like I'm not really a billionaire but who cares you know like I yeah I got uh you know like he's he's at that 510 5'11 range and like you know those guys want to be six foot he was like that's pretty much six right would choose so he's like you know he's at 800 million or 900 million or something like that he's like I don't know I don't really keep track does it really matter it seems seems Seems like overkilled to care about something like that that's nice billionaire response he did two interesting things one he built a private members Club in San Francisco so he bought a old Candy Factory that was 60,000 square feet that was abandoned because it needed tons of like seismic retrofitting nobody wanted to put in the millions of dollars it would take to retrofit this place he did it and he built a members Club so if you go to San Francisco you can go to this place called the battery and it's like Soho house but for San Francisco um built that thing into a real juggernaut like it actually like to totally came to fruition this idea that seemed kind of crazy and he had no experience in he had never done Hospitality never done any of that stuff one time I went there and I saw a booth of three people and it was a b like imagine a monk wearing like the the Daly Lama like orange outfit like he was baldheaded and sandals with like a black guy that looked like a rapper like he had like gold chains on and like sick shoes and then this blond haired lady and they were all leading in having a conversation and I was like this is just the funniest place I've ever been to that's like the start of a joke a monk a rapper and a and Cheryl Sandberg walking into a bar like no but that's what I mean I saw Leonardo DiCaprio there uh you know tons of famous Elon Musk a bunch of famous people go there anyways so he that was one thing he did but he always had these like random ideas and once in a while he would just be like Sean I'd like to I have an idea for you and he would pitch me this idea and one of the ideas he had was around the presidential debate he goes you know Trump got elected in I think what 2016 he he was thinking about it for 2020 he was like you know I think there's a good chance that Trump gets reelected again and he's like you know if you think about why a lot of people in silika Valley don't really fully you know they're like they take these like you know strong stances on what it means what you know is it because part of America feels repressed and they're reacting to the to the LI liberal neocon they start making up all these words he's like I don't know if it's that as much as it is that Donald Trump was the more charismatic candidate and he's like if you go back and you look throughout time he's like in every debate or sorry every race um if you go back to the last like 12 elections which is like you know 50 years or something like that the more charismatic candidate tends to win not always but tends to win and they're usually like tall not ugly people yeah he's just like the more charismatic candidate wins as simple as that right like maybe you're charismatic because you're really good looking and you're you know uh maybe it's that maybe it's that you got The Gift of Gab and you're like you know maybe an Obama or Reagan or something like that um you know Clinton you know somebody who is is just seen as very very Charming uh people people always felt that about Bill Clinton um so he's like you know the more charismatic candidate tends to win even though um you know there are other reasons why you might pick you know why I pick John krey over George Bush um actually George Bush is the more charismatic candidate versus uh John krey or Al Gore or whatever it is and um so he's like you know I think that given that that's the case uh he's like I don't think that should be the case but I think it is I don't think he G be able to change that he goes I feel like what the Democrats should do is they need to put forward the most charismatic candidate they can and I would say he turned out to be wrong in that they put Joe Biden who's one of the least charismatic candidates and he won almost because the vote was basically Donald Trump or not Donald Trump so I actually think it was a bit of anomaly I actually think he was correct uh and you're seeing this right now DeSantis has more experience had the machine behind him had the track record but he's just not charismatic he doesn't have that that je he doesn't have that sauce and so a guy like VI can come out and he's a better talker he's more uh he's got more energy he's got better onliners zingers he's willing to take stands that will draw attention to him and he's the more charismatic candidate he's he's driving up um so Michael's idea was let's create a TV show he's like you know just like the way we did uh American Idol and we did you know The Apprentice why don't uh why isn't there a show called the president and we literally just cast people who want to be the president but we give them an Avenue he's like because right now the candidates all come from the machine it's like you know the party is going to kind of push their favorite candidates forward and this is based on some you know how controllable they are how likable they are how uh much time they put in into the party he's like I don't think that's necessarily putting the strongest candidate forward especially if you looked at this most charismatic candidate um so he's like why don't you create he's like why don't we create a show that's going to take 12 hopefuls and it tells their story the show works almost like a Survivor or Apprentice every week they go to a new city maybe they go to some coal mining place in wherever West Virginia and they're going to talk to the coal miners and there's sort of a challenge like they have to prepare a speech or or uh talking points for what they would do for to help those people and then those people kind of vote off the weakest candidate at the end you're left with the most charismatic candidate and he's like that would be a a challenger to whoever the Democratic part is naturally going to put up and I loved this idea I was like this is a crazy idea this and he's like yeah my friend Mark Bernett who created Survivor like he could be the producer of this and and you know we could put this together this way and you know even if it doesn't work like you know I think it would just be like a worthwhile attempt and a and an entertaining way to do this versus like if I really want to get involved in politics the reason I don't don't is that's a sort of a very uh like it's not you know it's a laborious and sort of painful Endeavor this would be almost a fun version of like a way to try to to know bring some influence to it um what do you think of this idea that uh that I just remembered did it go anywhere or is he just goofing around he Al so he wrote a memo and it was a very well-written memo is that the rich guy version of buy the domain name yeah yeah he wrote a wrote a memo he showed it to me and I'm like yeah this is great and I think he was like okay if I'm going to do this this is going to take some real kind of like Social Capital to do and I think he kind of was like H Maybe not maybe my life is amazing as is um that's his version of like when the remote is just a little bit too far when you're lay down and you're like ah I'll sleep with the TV on yeah but I've love this idea and I'm saying it because hey I think that more business people should apply their kind of creative and entrepreneurial talents outside of just creating yet another business so I liked that he was taking his creative and entrepreneurial Spirit to be like oh how could I what if I did a TV show that would influence politics I thought that was cool and I think more people should do that the second reason is I kind of wish this idea existed and I totally think this would work if somebody created it so what's funny is like because you and I've I've I've I've complim to do with this but this is actually a criticism at this point uh for this particular Point compliment s par special I don't even know what that meant should I prepare myself for a compliment or an insult just tell me that the compliment was that you're WorryFree and like you're pretty optimistic and you always like default like oh that person they're not trying to do anything bad here comes the [ __ ] slap but in this case when I hear this I'm like um but I want like my president to like know what they're doing and not just be able to like be a a good speech Giver uh and so dude that's what we have now you think you think Joe Biden knows what he's doing the guy's not even alive well I'm not saying what I know works and what I know doesn't work I'm just saying that like my romantic view is like well that would be it would be also nice if they knew what they were talking about rather than just good at talking yeah your take on this is like wouldn't it be cool if we just let the most charismatic person run away with it well you know I think you could design the challenges to actually get them force them to think on the spot or perform uh in terms of figuring out solutions to real problems um or like putting forth what their solutions would be in a way that's not just prepared by handlers who have talking points and they're going to avoid the issue or false promises or whatever like these people that would be in this uh you could design the weekly challenge to bring out whatever it is that you want obviously people fall in love with the characters that's how all reality TV works you fall in love with the characters however you could fall in love with them as they're trying to do certain things in the same way that they Apprentice would test you for can you figure out how to sell can you figure out how to organize a project or manage a plan um I think you could put people through a battery of weekly challenges that are not just are you good at kissing babies and shaking hands but like you know that's part of it but the there could be other parts of it that um you know the show decides is like you know what are the attributes that a president needs or the qualities or what do we wish we could see them doing to be able to assess their uh abilities I think the cynical person would say well we should look at their track record serving in government yeah cool but that doesn't happen that's not really what that's not really what happens it's not really what works if that worked you know Trump would never have beaten Hillary she had spent her whole life in politics she had she was by far on paper the more qualified candidate but America didn't get to see that they didn't get to appreciate that uh all they saw was what gets put forward today which is debates and campaigning on social media or on TV there's this funny story about JFK when do you remember like uh what the Cold War was you know it was in the 60s where like we thought that Soviet Union and America were going to like bomb each other yeah there's this story where JFK John Kennedy goes to um Soviet Union and he meets with the president or the leader of Soviet Union and at the end of the meeting this the the leader was like you know you're you're a really nice person you kind of reminded me of my son I guess like we could be we could be cool like you know you seem you seem kind and I read that story and I was like oh I guess like charisma really does matter a whole lot when it comes to like diplomatic stuff like just being likable and being like hey let's just calm down let be friends it definitely Ison Robin tells the story I don't know if this is real or not but who was the do you know who who was the president during the Cold War is that well Kennedy Kennedy for Cold War was a long period but Kennedy was like when we thought that we were literally gonna bomb each other okay there was I don't I feel like it wasn't cidate he was talking about but Tony Robbins tells the story he goes I was I had a chance to talk to former president who whoever let's just pretend I know and care about presidential history sure and he's like uh the Cold War was happening and he went to go see I think it was cold war people who actually know about this are gonna you you have full permission to beat me up in the comments so he goes to see gorbachov and um they have a meeting and the meeting is not going well the Hope was we could deescalate but actually the meeting was sort of like tension um and like neither side wanted to give and they were sort of getting more dug in more stubborn in their stance and this is uh this would be Reagan Ronald Reagan Reagan all my married man out there know when this happens you think you're going into deescalate but actually both sides are what s par calls dug in and the tension is escalating he doesn't know really what to do and he goes he goes how did you do it how did he's like something happened in that meeting that worked what was it he goes well we hit that point I said this is not going to work and I got up and I walked out of the room fast stormed out of the room and right before I got to the door I hit him with a little 360 turned back big smile on my face said let's start over smil on his face shook his hand and said I'm you I'm Ronald and you know I really appreciate these things about you and he like Turned he just basically like you know broke the frame for a second and used a little bit of Charisma a little bit of playfulness in order to reduce tension and then they had a conversation now I have no idea if the story is true Tony Robbins told me this I believed it in the moment because it's a great story and who why let the truth get in the way of a good story um if it is true that's unbelievable if it's partially true that's really cool if it's totally made up ah whatever uh you know it's okay still the story still serves his purpose it is a very useful technique to be able to do this to be able to use a little bit of Charisma and playfulness in order to diffuse a situation or to uh to break through any like Deadlocks that that exist whether it's in business or in personal so either Vic is just not charismatic or I'm an idiot but let me tell you a really quick story I have um so I've turned down two presidential candidates to either come on this pod or speak at my events the first one was Andrew uh what's his name Yang the guy the math guy so he emailed me I think in 2015 being like hey I want to come speak at your event and I don't know if the podcast existed then but he's like or if you guys want to write about me in the newsletter I'd love to do interview you know I I run this study test prep company it did okay and now I'm running for president and I was like oh you're insane you're you're like you're gonna make me look like a fool just this nobody guy who run a mediocre business uh running for president I can't interview you like that that hurt my my credibility Well turns out he was a serious candidate at least he made it in the top 10 or whatever the second time this happened was viic viic viic Lady Gaga it's not it's not is it not called faag it's fetas fajitas um so vivec dm'd me on Twitter like a year ago and he was like hey would you guys want me to come on the Pod and I spped on him hard I thought this was because he had a really his Twitter picture was him in a suit with a nice smile stuff it nerd you're not coming on the podcast well and I think like I was like researching Martin scarelli and I was like oh this and his bio said he was in BIO like uh pharmaceutical industry or something like that and I was like oh this guy's a Charon like he's so good-looking he's got a nice smile this is like a crypto guy with abs and a Ferrari like I can't take this guy seriously and I just said what do you want to talk about like and I Tred to like stiff arm him to like make him prove himself and he replied and I ignored him turns out you know a year and a half two years later he's actually a threat so this is the second presidential candidate that I've had bad judgment on of whether they're going to be serious and not asking them to come on the Pod yeah yeah totally uh totally with you I'm by the way for high entertainment do you subscribe to Ronda Sis's SMS program no no so if you want to learn about marketing or you want to learn how the presidential race really works go subscribe to all the candidates um marketing emails and text messages warning it's [ __ ] annoying okay so that's the first problem if I wanted somebody to text me every day I'd have a girlfriend and uh this guy texts you all the time and they text the dumbest stuff so like here I'm just going to read you the last

friend I'm out here draining the swamp right now and it's like dude just stop like what are you talking about well they're building like a billion- dollar company in like 18 months they're like a moving company you ever notice how like moving companies like they don't give a [ __ ] about the service because like you're only going to use it once and they're like let me just get you a board gotcha [ __ ] and then they's like throw your [ __ ] there they're like dude we don't give it like renewals aren't a thing here I don't care you know I mean I I hired this service that was like um it was called like muscle head movers or something like that and all of the imagery all of the imagery was just the huge like buff guys it was like hey we make it easy we'll move that couch we'll move that fridge no problem just another day at the gym for us so I'm like oh hell yeah Tire muscle head movers three tiny Vietnamese guys showed up and I was like and the the truck said muscle head movers and I was like got him I'm looking at him and I'm just are you going to say anything are you going to address this friend and they didn't and I didn't cuz I was like what am I supposed to say here and I was like want a bunch of greas up punks hoping and they did the job like they could move everything because they just used dollies and I was like oh if I wanted Dolly movers I would have you know like it's different it's a different experience than I signed up for that catfished that's so stupid um there's uh there is one cool thing I wanted to to tell you about all right what is it there's a guy named Seth Bannon who tweeted this out he goes um two million scient ific papers are published each year that's over 5,000 a day even if you're working 10 hours a day no breaks you'd have to read one paper every seven seconds just to keep up so we built paper scraper to like basically programmatically read every paper that comes out um but not just every single paper we prioritize and wait any paper that's being shared by top scientists on social media so basically built a thing that makes it easier to keep up with science and uh he's the second person I've seen d this and I'm actually like pretty convinced it's actually just a good product idea so what's the uh what's the URL do you know because it's so new it doesn't show up on Google there's not a a website for it yet he's like oh like we built this for ourselves but like I'll let some people in beta if you fill out this type form you know like that sort of thing like soft launch I would love to see our buddy um leor who does alpha signals so this guy built like a uh you know like a AI newsletter thing but his AI newsletter has one key difference which is instead of just telling jabronies like what the new chat GPT feature is it's basically a AI newsletter that's for technical people so if you're a researcher you're a machine learning engineer you're a um a PhD type person Alpha signal is a newsletter for those people which I actually think is a very smart way to approach this business because that's a very high value reader and customer and for them he provides a very simple service so he also built a thing like this internally so what he did was he goes all right every paper has uh you know a list of scientists uh that are like the researchers that were involved and actually there's a a nameing convention just like in movies the credits like the F the stars go first and the people at the back were like kind of the end credits in research papers it's kind of the same thing the people at the top did all the work the last person is like the the Nam person who reviewed it or edited at the end or stamped you know their seal of approval on it or the lab they're associated with so he kind of first created a a a page rank of researchers and scientists this is awesome then he's like cool now when a paper comes out that has one of them in the name or those people on social media share a paper I immediately know this is probably an interesting paper so that first creates a Hit List he gets alerted like alert top scientist a Shar page page rank is what Google invented it's how they know what to show up on the top of Google page rank is categorized like there's a bunch of different measurements the biggest measurement or they don't even tell people but it's theorized or maybe they even said this though but which is how many people link back to your website yeah how many other reputable websites linked to yours so every every website has Authority so let's say New York Times has a high Authority compared to sean.com right and so if New York Times links to some other website that tells Google that that other website might be uh and also a high Authority site it increases its Authority if Sean links to it it increases it a teeny tiny tiny amount and so that's how Google basically figured out what's the right you know what's the right web page to show when I when you search a question who's who has the most authority to to give you the answer so um this guy uh for Alpha signal leor did this for for scientific papers so he's like who are the top scientists what are they sharing what are they linking to if they're linking to something that's an important paper or an interesting paper they you take the interesting paper feed it through his llm and it gets summarized down into four bullet points like what was the What did the what was the finding what was the methodology who are the scientists and what's the kind of like key uh takeaways from from this an alpha signal is only for like AI topic correct but I'm like dude this is a generalized product that's actually just really interesting like your I was like your method to create this newsletter is more interesting to me than the newsletter itself yeah yeah yeah and paper scraper is the same idea just from a different guy approaching it from a slightly different angle which was same thing like basically trying to figure out what are the important papers that are coming out so of the of the two million papers or of the 5,000 that are published every day which three should I care about which five should I care about and then of the five that I care about what did they actually mean and what do they say yeah they're really hard to read hard to read so I think this is a really really cool product idea and then he also built like a thing called spin out GPT which was basically like you can it's like chat GPT you can ask it questions about things that might like you know could we commercialize uh this and or like would this work in a Cell C culture or tissue and then it'll go look in the paper and find did they do it in cell culture or tissue and it'll answer uh that way so it's almost like being able to talk to research papers or talk to talk to a very smart person that read all of the research papers and it's like oh I see where this is going like you know the hustle milk Road these were like um the horse carriages right like yeah we have random humans trying to keep up with what's going on maybe they set up some Google Alerts so they check Reddit and Twitter and every day they make a list and we talk about it and then they read it and summarize and they summarize it as good as they can and then like you know the pitch was like it's like your smart friend explaining what happened in crypto that day or yours was it's like your smart friend explaining what happened in business news that day and this is like this is like your [ __ ] genius friend that read every scientific paper ever and you can ask it any question in any variation and it will answer you're like well that seems pretty powerful huh like if we're on our horseback and just like a car just flew by whoa what the hell was that but what about my friend Greg he uh no I by the way I'm happy we I I would not want to be in the newsletter business right now it which is so funny because everybody's following us into the newsletter businesses now like now he's like Peak hype on newsletters and also the way that people are acquiring users like I just subscribed to Seth band and substack and like right after I subscribed it said do you want to subscribe to these 18 other newsletters and it's Auto checked and I almost accidentally clicked like yes it's like and they're all like whoa look at my newsletter growth it's insane and it's like dude anyone on subst that's talk about your newsletter growth you're full of [ __ ] is my my answer to you like you are absolutely full of [ __ ] it's like people think they're feeling out a capture and they're actually subscribing to 19 newsletters like at a time it's insane that's why you know what I like beehive has a good feature they did a feature like that that's actually legit which is their thing was you can you have to manually be like who do I want to endorse but also they have this thing what it's called like Sparks or some [ __ ] like that but it's like you can pay to acquire newsletter subscribers like all of us know the best newsletter subscrib you can get is somebody who already subscribes to other newsletters that are similar but that's really hard to get historically because you have to advertise in like a hundred different newsletters so they created a little mini ad Network inside uh inside beehive of all the Beehive newsletters but what's cool about it was you only pay for somebody who's a retained reader and I was like oh okay that's actually legit so instead of just like this like Auto Che vanity metric where it's like hey I got more subscribers but it's like are they actually an Engaged reader you have no idea but you're you're excited about that anyway anyways what I like that bive did was you only pay it's like you know CPA versus CPM or CPC it's like CPA is like you only pay for a reader you actually acquired who's still reading from you and um and so enforces quality because that's the only way you get rewarded in that Network so I was like that's smart first of all this Seth Bandon thing is awesome I just I the tweet that Sean's referring to is from June 12 so if you Google Seth Bannon and go to his thing it was on June 12th that's awesome he filmed the video in like in a amazing Place uh like it looks like a TED Talk almost but like with like an IMAX style screen explaining his concept I don't know if that would be a good business I'm I'm nervous about people building businesses right now on top of open AI because I'm like they're just going to crush everyone and just do it themselves but this is awesome and second yeah to to reiterate I'm happy I'm not doing a newsletter as my main thing right now it seems really really hard and like I remember at the hustle we had one daily newsletter and then morning Brew's um strategy was to launch more but my thing was like [ __ ] but if we have more our main thing was going to go down like they're not going to open two they're not going to open three now people if the numbers are true are subscribing to dozens and I want to know is the engagement even remotely the same it seems really really really hard it seems way harder yeah I think it's a lot like podcasts like how many podcasts do you actually have in a regular rotation any given time yeah it seems hard I mean with News letters it's easier because it only takes three minutes to skim it but it seems really hard to get people's attention with the newsletter right now it's just so funny when we so I got the idea for a newsletter because I had my friend Neville madora and my other friend Noah Kagan they were like they had one foot into the startup world one foot into like the internet marketing world and I was like oh this internet marketing World they love email and they use it in sometimes Shady ways but let's just see if we can do it a legit way and people are like laughing at that now it's so cool but but also that that people take it seriously but I'm so happy I'm not doing it it seems way more challenging at the moment I uh it it seems really hard yeah I think the best will still win um because you know the best tends to win and everything um like you know so so it's not that the do actually closed um but it's definitely much harder than when you started you when did you start 2015 2016 yeah it I got the idea of doing a newsletter and I started it in 2014 but it became what it was in uh on May 19th 2016 a great day in history well I always remember that because it's the day before 420 uh so it always it was always easy to remember um but yeah and it was like I remember like at for I originally started as a conference and if I had five uh if I had 2,000 subscribers to my conference newsletter I think I made $50,000 in conference ticket sales and then when I had 10,000 I think we did 150,000 in ticket sales something like that and like the engagement was quite high and then I remember people back then saying I think Gary vaynerchuk I talked to him one time he was like dude my newsletter we had a 99% open rate because no one else was doing newsletters yours is only 40% it's so much harder and uh I was like oh man I wish it was easier now I I don't know what those numbers would be like but I think it would be hard to make that amount of money with as few subscribers today as it it was easier then you know the other thing that's funny is um or I guess the other thing that that kind of reminds me of is you're I wish people would see kind of your early blog post or you should we should do kind of like a trip down memory lane of some of our projects um because you're incredibly good at creating content and writing um we like when I see what you did versus what I see a lot of people doing now I'm like oh there are like many rungs on the ladder above is where where where you were with creating content um back then like I remember your early blog posts that were just regularly going viral getting millions of hits to the site um because they were that good like which ones like when you were doing the got you like first you had the right concept so you were kind of like a YouTuber before YouTube actually you really should have been a YouTuber like that would have been your calling I I believe we got we got asked to like we were thinking about doing it but I wasle saying s par as a YouTuber would have been I believe like you would have been one of the most successful YouTubers on the platform let me give you an example that's awesome you're like for example I remember some of your early hustle blog posts uh surviving 30 days on soy lent only guess what that sounds like every Ryan trean video every Mr Beast video like this is this is the current meta of YouTube you were doing this eight years ago you know like it was you were wa uh you did micro doing LSD you did an interview with a Anonymous entrepreneur who um whoes books yeah yeah you did the the the thing where you were like Amazon bestsellers are [ __ ] I'm gonna prove it by making an Amazon bestseller spending only like a$ thousand dollars guess what that's a YouTube video These Are YouTube videos they would these videos would still work but the thing is you have to do them with style you actually did the thing with style now you your problem was you were locked into this blog world because those are the people you admired at the time the real I knew how to write you know like writing was my thing I wasn't I don't know if I could have maybe I could had the visual aesthetic too like you're good on camera you like lived in a freaking you like lived on a motorcycle or something I don't know you sleeping on a motorcycle you're doing some crazy [ __ ] it's like you had the dog and you had the look and you had the the humor on camera and you were willing you you liked jackass and those sorts of things and I feel like you would have kind of tortured yourself for people's entertainment as soon as you got that hit of feedback you would have gone all the way in wish you had kind of gone down that route in fact I still think you should go down that route like for example I think I can be successful in fact I'm going to be successful on short form video but it's not going to be the way you could have been because you're kind of like those like you know whoever this Danny Duncan and uh and Ryan Tran and and and you know Mr be you're a lot like them in the the way that you are as a character and what you're willing to do and what you were willing to do and how long you were kind of like I'm single and don't give a [ __ ] and like I don't need comfort and like you know oh like this firecracker is going to go in my ass all right let's roll like you know lights action right like I think that you had all of that and so um anyways I don't know what my point I don't wish I would have gone that by the way I don't I I think I think I I think I probably could have done it I think that that's a hard life I think it's hard like I like Danny Duncan a lot but I'm like can you do that at 40 I guess it just has to change it has to evolve or like Mr Beast what's he going to do at 40 he's going to be so wealthy doesn't really matter yeah I you would have done the same yeah but um yeah like our early blog posts were good and there was a period where I was writing like five a day um I would write so many of them not all of them were bangers but like we would write a ton and that's how we grew and that's why I tell people I say to blog I don't actually mean blog but I meant create bangers text based bangers uh on a consistent basis and get people to love your free content enough to subscribe TBB baby text based bangers that's been our strategy right like how' you like for me um when we wanted to grow on Twitter it was like all the advice was you got to be consistent well guess what I'm like the least consistent human being on earth like if you weren't super consistent and a real hard ass about like we're gon to record this every Monday every Wednesday 9:00 am every single every single week without fail no matter what there's no way I would keep up this schedule right like I only do that because you're my friend I don't want to let you down the when I'm on my own I'm inconsistent and when I wanted to grow on Twitter I was like look all the conventional wisdoms you got to tweet every day multiple times a day find the right time of the day be consistent be on brand have a single message do a call to action I'm like dude I ain't trying to do all that that sounds like hard sounds like the lame version of success and um I agree it's probably right but like I didn't want to do it that way and my way was text based bangers it's like I basically had like six viral tweets That Grew me to like almost 400,000 followers just it was literally just six tweets basically that the bulk of the grow like the club one the metaverse one this one about Elon Musk this other one it's just like that's all it was that that got me like kind of all the growth and then just's like several weeks in between posts I'm completely inconsistent well what I told people was like my team and like myself when I was starting the hos I was like you know everyone says it's a marathon not a Sprint but you're kind of just telling me that you just don't want to work that hard and if you look at the worldclass marathoners that's going to feel like a Sprint to most people so that's just kind of like how we're going to live our life which is is like it is a marathon and it's run so fast that it's going to feel like a Sprint to most people this a marathon not a Sprint but we're Kenyon and so we're going Five Mile my last pretend yeah your last name is Kip chogi you know you're gonna be a Kenyan yeah you could be a belli you're an Ethiopian but you know like we're East Africans here baby we're gonna run fast and uh yeah I think um but I actually I prefer writing I think that it's more fun to be in a quiet Zone late at night and just bang it out and it feels a little bit more Artful uh it felt like I was in my zone of Genius a little bit whereas with video it feels like sometimes you have to perform and I felt that writing was a different type of performance that is more enjoyable to create for me yeah sure dude surprise surprise man likes his choices and defends them by the way look at my Shir person thinks that what they did was the correct thing shocker I I did live life look at me when I was fat and selling hot dogs man I was about I was about I was that YouTube life it just you know without the camera I was telling Sarah I was like I'm nervous about going to Westport or like Connecticut or like if we're gonna move to the suburbs and she's like why I was like well what am my favorite things to do is like so every day I like to go to this gas station near my house and get a DI Dr Pepper and loer like I just like yeah I get a slip JY and a Diet pepper and I'll like dab it up with like the clerk and then I'll just sit and see the regulars like what's up man redell what's good how are you like I just like to loiter like do hood rat [ __ ] man yeah and I was like Connecticut doesn't have like hood rats or they people that pump your gas yeah what am I gonna do like where like I want to watch people buy lottery tickets and scratch offs and like like smoke like a miles like where am I going to hang out with like I need that smell of like the woods they call it you know like the uh the Blunts and uh where am I going to do that you know like that's how you get like good ideas and you like see interesting people so yeah think about how many incredible podcasters there are that just don't podcast but they just chop it up sitting on steps like all day just talking around people that come by like can you imagine how good those people would be if we just put a mic in front of them they just don't know like they're just they're just like you know it's like those like kids who are like incredible basketball players somewhere in afca that we just don't know we haven't found them yet like just imagine the dudes that just stood on the steps all day just shooting the [ __ ] that like jogan is lucky those guys don't have a microphone and they just like sit outside of a gas station like read newspapers I always be funny I always thought it' be funny if you like walk up and you overhear their conversation and they're like dog you better diversify your bonds man like the Dow's down like are just having like the most academic conversations ever because they read newspapers all day all right I think we've uh I think we've crossed crossed the threshold the slab happy face is initiated all right that's the pod

our most recent interview with Mr Beast when we went out to North Carolina you know we were there for a full day prepping for the Pod but at the last minute realized we didn't have a table and Colin and I went to a furniture store in North Carolina two hours before we sat down with him and were just scrambling to buy a table and then assemble it had to arrange for it to be delivered and basically it all happened within a matter of two hours prior to sitting down and I felt very not present in the first half of that you know I was I was just coming off like okay that was intense why didn't I think of that immediately already being retrospective of the process of you know and so all of that stuff I think just have to eliminate

you can turn off Wi-Fi and do this idea I like that so what if I told you that in San Francisco I discovered a business that does 31 million dollars in Revenue locally here in San Francisco on that 31 million in Revenue it does about 11 million in profit and it's brick and mortar brick and mortar wow and it has a hundred million dollars of assets on the balance sheet you want to take a guess of what kind of business this is well it's one of the things you've had listed but does it involve religion it does not no oh what is it it is [Music] all right we're live happy labor day we are celebrating by laboring yes right join me in this labor Sam let's do a labor of love because it is a day of Labor today's episode is all about ideas business ideas and opportunities did you like preparing for this I love preparing for this I bet you did not this is not my favorite thing to prepare for it feels like a book report whereas my favorite episodes or what I just find cool [ __ ] throughout the week and I just go have you seen this this is cool versus this one I was like oh I got to like go and like find things that uh like I gotta seek them out a little bit more to me this is like you know in a relationship where you it's like oh our relationship is just us doing things together right like I gotta go to the grocery store come with me to the grocery store that's that's our date but you forget that you got to do a date night once in a while you gotta you gotta break out the rose petals you gotta figure out a way to to keep it spicy to me that's what these these episodes are where when we started this podcast it was very much like what what are ideas business opportunities for people and that's how we got that initial momentum because no one else was doing that and then over time it's like well listen we're doing two episodes week we can't be having like 20 good ideas a week that's not really how it works so we started blending in just cool businesses we discovered interesting things that are going on in our companies whatever that's like the that's like the Costco pizza date night you know what I'm saying like oh let's go to Costco get some toilet paper and we'll get a pizza right that's that counts right which is which is great so this is a throwback this is we uh we sprayed some cologne we we got a little hair gel and uh and putting on pants for the first time in a while and here we go this is date night for MFM um where do you want to start so I'm actually very happy that we have one overlapping thing that makes me pumped um and also a bunch of our things are big which also makes me pumped I do not like the Small Time stuff we're gonna have a range though there's gonna be a couple that are like simple um what I'll call like more like simple side hustle it's like here's a way that you could replace a job you're not really Gonna Get Rich doing it per se but you could definitely get to I don't know 10K a month 20K a month doing this um and then we have a bunch of Big Ideas so I tried to stay away from like complete moonshot ideas in this in this one I I I have a few big ones what what do you wanna can we actually start with I think one that interests you and I that is a big one do you want to talk about that one or do you want to start small first all right yeah let's go last episode we gave a preview there was one company we I don't know if we've ever talked about it but I can just read your mind and know that you thought this was cool but in about 2012 or so I think it's starting 2008 but it got popular in like 2012. there was a company called clout it was clout with a k k l o u t and I remember I was just getting started like on the internet and I only had like I had like 4 000 Facebook friends and that was like considered big and you this company called clop came out and basically what you could do is log in with your Facebook your LinkedIn your Twitter and I don't even know if Instagram existed in that way back then uh or I guess it maybe did whenever it switched to Facebook but it was really fascinating because what they would do is they would give you a clout score and with that clout score what you would do is it would it would range between one and 100 I think there was a time when I had like a 75 or something Obama was like a 92 like so give me perspective and what would happen is it was a platform for companies like McDonald's well at least that's who I got I got like five dollar McDonald gift cards so like their new promotions they would basically find out like information about your background so what you're interested in what you're posting and then how popular you are and they would give you free stuff in hopes that you would go out and like the experience and share it that company was acquired uh they raised like 40 million dollars they were acquired in 2014 for 200 million bucks but I don't think that was a very successful exit I think that they probably just sold for the amount of money that they raised at however I've been thinking about this idea constantly and I think it's really really really cool so the way it got started was in 2017 the guy who started his name was Joe Fernandez he had some surgery uh on his jaw something was wrong with his jaw so his jaw was wired shut for three months and so he was like in this hospital bed laying around and he didn't have anything to do and so he said he he he just got obsessed with can Word of Mouth be measurable and so he created this API or he created this program where you could pull from Twitter's API and give a score out of a hundred based off of how influential the person was and he got obsessed with this and he started going around deeper and deeper and deeper on this and eventually it turned into a company where by like 2011 it was pretty popular and this one person um said something amazing where they're trying to hate on clout and they said something like uh they took the cloud took the entire spectrum of human interaction and condensed it into a two number a two-digit number that you could use to bludgeon anyone who failed to adhere to its uh it basically just said it's tacky it's basic it's cheap and they're like you you you can't just put someone's like give someone a score and that'd be their self-worth and in my head I'm like well that's actually awesome that's a really cool service and so the company got quite popular it was bought in whatever I said 2014 by lithium which I don't even know what that is and it doesn't exist anymore and I was curious about it and I said Joe I we dm'd them I go do you think that this could still exist today he goes this is something I'll never get over in so many ways we were just way too early the world still needs something like this uh like clout more than ever unfortunately I'm not sure if it's possible to pull out uh to pull it off and get all the data however the idea of clout for anyone one in the in our era like just getting started in the 2010-2014 range this was awesome and I think a business like this 100 should still exist because when we're sponsoring influencers and stuff for different companies it's really hard to know what's legit and what isn't so what do you think about Cloud what did you remember I remember back then I thought it was such a smart idea I was like oh this is great yeah like everybody you know across all social you have followers but we all kind of know followers ain't exactly it and um to layer on on just another number that even if you thought it was stupid you didn't want to be at the bottom and I was like oh that's good that one it's a powerful draw right it's just like any other ratings or reviews but I was like this is great because it doesn't require people to have ratings and reviews they could just basically crawl the data or just take the connected data and give you a score based off of it so I really like that on the other side it was unclear to me exactly how this was going to be used so for example you're saying when we're figuring out whether to pay and you know who which influence to sponsor or how to pay them uh you know something like this is useful problem with this that it was more compelling to the cloud user who wanted their score to know their score and for it to go up than it was for the brands who needed to find influencers and so I think it really had half of the problem I think the second half like it wasn't a must-have because for example you can you know you kind of like if you're a brand you kind of know who influencers are even if you don't know you could look at the followers you can look at their rough engagement say okay how many likes to followers you get a very quick proxy for this you could use cloud but I'm not going to pay cloud like 30 grand a year for that type of information so the question is what type of information what would be the the right way to use that clout score how could they what could they do with that cloud score and I I don't know what that answer is but I think that's where you would have to start if you wanted to restart this idea what do you think what do you think people could do with this or do you agree with me that it's hard to charge a brand a lot of money for what's somewhat obvious which is uh you know which influencers have have pull I think you're thinking like a small medium-sized business owner and not McDonald's and not like a huge card I think it's like a 50 million dollar a year business not a billion a really funny story uh so I had I did an interview with Emmett or I did applied with Emmett uh the other day so Emmett is the CEO founder of twitch and twitch had bought my company and so anyways I uh it went well overall it's gonna come out in a couple days but there was one really funny part where he just burned me so bad and I was just so shook by it I couldn't even like it took me like five minutes mentally to recover from this I was so embarrassed by it well you texted me you said uh he said something to me that stuck in my head and it almost really makes me so hard so like I was trying to set him up for like dude uh I learned so much from you I was like I learned so much from you and uh one of the things you taught me was this cool little model during our first one-on-one you were like oh hey here's a here's a good way to use uh like here's a good way to like format these conversations here's like a way to plug it like here's here's a way to use me if I was a piece of Machinery here's a manual on how to use it and he's like you can come in and you can say one of three things you can be like hey I'm doing this FYI uh you know here's my decision FYI here's my the second one is here's my dis here's what I think we should do do I have your approval right maybe it's very risky it takes a lot of money to do it third one I don't know what to do can you help me and fourth one is LA last time we talked about this and here's where I'm at now and like that's the update and I was like that was really useful is that something that you figured out like where'd you learn that I was trying to get a sense for it and he was like he's like yeah that's really good for like mid-level managers and I was like oh man he's like if you're a super seasoned executive I guess I would do it differently but that's really good for you're not Junior but you're not like a super seasoned exec and I was like it's absolutely absolutely true I'm not a super seasoned corporate executive I've never I think that's what the word where the word mid has come from yeah but I was like I don't want to be mid-level anything like you could be like hey what floor are you staying on I'm like I'm in the 19th Floor they're like I thought he'll tell Keith said ninth I was like no no I don't stay in the mid level of nothing I'm not don't ever put me there and so he burned me and I was like uh he didn't even he wasn't trying to burn me he was trying to be totally nice but in my head I was like oh my God I just got burned and then for the next five minutes I don't even know what he said and then I came back to the interview after that well you should have brought that up you're like look I can't get this out of me I should have did you which is good you know when you have that like compounding social awkwardness where it's like the thing hap you know uh I'm checking into my flight they say have a nice flight and I say you too you too yeah and then I'm like oh screwed up and then you're like what I sure just do is laugh it off right now like a smooth guy and instead you just pause you eat it and now it's like oh now it's been too long and then you're kind of you're in your own head about it so that's that's what I did uh at least you you accidentally call them it Mom you had one of those moments like when I said it was like 55 minutes later but like ah just circling back to that mid-level thing I know you didn't mean that right can you say that differently in a way that feels better to me is he like genius is is he like one of those guys that's the other problem too you can't even be like ah this idiot doesn't know what he's talking about it's like no this genius knows exactly what he's talking about is he working at twitch still no he retired that's sick all right well maybe Emmett will be the new CEO of twitch or uh cloud or something like that I don't know what's he gonna do now like go to Mars I mean he's like pretty wealthy now yeah I think he's gonna do like uh you know other stuff in life we talked about a little bit on the Pod but I think he's gonna like he wants to write a lot like essays and stuff like that like he was in the first YC batch I think he looks up to Paul Graham who's sort of a mentor for him and and then he really likes other people who have kind of like really contributed to like the intellectual discourse of the world and I think that's what he wants to do when for the next little period of his life not go back and operate another company he did that for 17 years which is pretty intense and Paul Graham lives I think like as ideal life as one can like he just like go yeah I think he lives in England now with his family and he just writes an essay once a month and everyone just does what he says uh you know what I mean like the whole the the YC Illuminati they just yes sir uh so it works out well um all right so Cloud I think is a cool idea but what do you got so restarting Cloud okay I think that's good I think I got a different version of uh of an idea that that was some uh like similar sort of Professional Services okay so we've had Andrew Wilkinson on the podcast a bunch and Andrew is a fan favorite and people I think like us really respect what he's done with tiny it's like oh tiny we buy businesses we buy wonderful businesses beautiful businesses right it's a great little stick and he's got a portfolio of I don't know 30 companies now at this point and uh the whole thing is worth I don't know what's the stock worth today maybe 700 million or something like that six to eight hundred On Any Given weeks Amazing so amazing sort of bootstrapped um Venture and he bootstrapped it because two of the businesses out of the 30 are the real crown jewels meta lab which is his design agency and the other one is dribble and dribble is a business that's very very simple which was it is based on the simple Insight every career needs its online resume right every job that you're going to do needs a a way it's for you to show what you're all about and get more jobs and so for most jobs we have like the catch-all the generic which is LinkedIn so LinkedIn is going to say um hey just put a put a resume up here just say what you've done and hopefully that's good enough but for some jobs you need something more special so for example if you're a designer LinkedIn doesn't really help you stand out that much but now dribble would let you go and post designs so design shots so like just like screenshots or or images of what you're designing as your portfolio and it became a portfolio site and so dribble itself is probably worth 250 million dollars I want to say um that's fine I'm trying to find the financials I'm trying to find the financials but it looks like in 2022 dribble did 8 million in profit but I'm pretty sure that uh it's like here it is uh it did uh 60 so in 2022 it did 62 million in Revenue with 8 million in earnings and because it's a network that could definitely sell for four or five times Revenue depending on its growth rate um yeah exactly so it's pretty valuable so I think 250 million dollars probably what dribble is worth now uh another friend of the Pod Scott belski did the same thing with behance he created B hands which is a place for designers to post their work to as a sort of a community for those designers to comment on each other's work but the business model was if you want to go hire a creative come to be hands and so dribble and B has both did the same thing I think he sold behance For What 100 million something like that no I think it was 175 of which she owned 60 or 70 percent of it amazing so what does that take me now okay so where can you apply this dribble or behance model that needs it today so Zuck I think seven years ago said something he goes video is a mega trend hey I was like what what's a mega trend is that like he's not Zuckerberg is not the type to just say like flowery words like when he says something he's he's part of the uh words mean things team um and so what's a Megatron he's like a mobile is a mega Trend the internet was a mega Trend and now video is a mega Trend and he's like basically video everything is who else is on that team who's also I stole that person Emmett calls it words mean things and I saw him in many many meetings derail the entire meeting because he was stuck like you said this word what does like what does that word mean and they're like uh I don't know we all know kind of right he's like I don't know does it mean this or this and then he's like he's like no because words mean things to me and so if we're gonna use words they're gonna mean things and we're gonna all agree on what those words mean so that we can have a productive conversation and I was like wow well it's the words means words mean things teams otherwise known as serious people you know like oh he's he's a serious he's he's serious people like when they say a handful of words you're like I know he or she specifically chose that word I love those types of people he calls it uh words mean things versus Team alliances and I don't know what team Alliance is there's a longer uh there's a longer explanation to that but um he's like you know there's sort of like two the way people think is in two two teams and one is like oh let's not get lost in semantics and the other is like semantics is everything that's how we're that's how we are going to communicate um let's let's not be weak about that let's words mean things let's agree on that um anyways so Zuck said this Megatron thing and if you look at it everything has shifted to video so entertainment Netflix streaming all that obviously onto video news is highly video education has become driven a lot by video e-commerce is driven by let's say video ads and uh how you're going to display your product um communication stupid podcast with zoom please audio is becoming we now have to we now have to go to YouTube and I have to wear like a nice shirt sometimes yeah I did I wet my hair like you know I used to do in school in the water fountain I wet my hair before the fudge there's a quick little spruce up so videos just make a trend but where do you hire people that specialize in working in videos so where do hire people that are video editors or um or even like the auxiliary things like thumbnail artists or uh video strategists where is their behance where is their dribble where can I go see portfolios or like a news feed of people who did really cool animations or um cool edits um to a video and then be able to hire those people and some of who's hiring a lot of video people I don't find this site I think if somebody created behance for video I think that that is a that is a big idea dribble for video I think that is I completely agree I 100 agree and uh I'll explain why so I actually had a very similar topic that I was going to bring up I was going to call it LinkedIn for x and the reason being is I think I think you told me about this it's called Uh dot docs is it docsaminity doximity doximity uh so basically it's LinkedIn for doctors you told me about it so I didn't realize it it's publicly traded it has a four or five billion dollar valuation it's a great business so it's basically which by the way LinkedIn context it has I think two million doctors LinkedIn probably has I don't know 300 million people or something like that hundreds of millions of users fractions and Linkedin sold for 20 billion doximity you said is at 4 billion so it's no five four point eight five okay so it's only four times less valuable than LinkedIn with 100x less customers right because the value per customer is so much higher yeah and and so I was reading about it and they had this term that I loved they go we where we launched this because we are always looking for digitally digitally under indexed Industries and I thought that was a beautiful word and so what that means is basically communities of professionals who just aren't aren't being catered to in a digital format so you could say lawyers you could say um I actually don't even know what else I mean there's a lot of them there's one there's one for blue collar workers called job case and the reason why this interests me is at Hampton what I'm noticing is that even though we didn't mean to do this we're sort of becoming a little bit of a network not quite a social network but I'm seeing I'm like if we wanted to which I don't really want to we could make this like a have you heard of Raya do you know what Raya is yeah the dating app for hot people yeah it's like well I I think they call it like Elites or something but it's like a paid dating app for like Elite so like the for the facial we Elite yeah or or or the the the the uh Bank Elite you know like if you have it depends she's gonna start saying instead of a socioeconomic underprivileged I'm facially underprivileged and uh I've been able to overcome this this adversity yeah well and this [ __ ] has gotten me really interesting because I think that what you can do which basically what how do you call it DOC City doximity what does that mean that's some see you have to know how to say the word in order to even get in sounds like a drug words mean things sounds don't even mean uh but this company dude so they're growing quickly they're doing like 400 million in Revenue 150 million in income so they've been profitable for years and they've built this LinkedIn for doctors and they think it's a really good business and what I've been really fascinated in uh fascinated about is what type of niches can you build professional networks uh that are somewhat ignored because do it on do go on to LinkedIn yeah I use LinkedIn what is your inbox on LinkedIn look like right now oh I just ignored the inbox mostly exactly why do you do that it's mostly mostly junk and uh expand yeah so it's crap it's crap the inbox of LinkedIn is horrible no networking is happening there and like people mostly use it for resume tracking and things like that but there's a bunch of jobs out there like lawyers like doctors where it's a relatively small community two million people three million people I think there's two and a half million lawyers in America there's 2.1 million doctors in America these are relatively small where you could have small it like circles that know 80 of the population on the network because I'm a friend with you who starts with you and then now I'm connected to you and like it's small enough and so I've been really fascinating very similar to the dribble thing dribble is a little bit more resume in showing off portfolio work uh this is a little bit more networking and but it's also resume I've been very fascinated by these businesses that do this and the hard part I think with any social network is it's like what's the Chicken and the Egg problem which is like you know it's not good unless we have users but we don't have any users and we need users yeah um but what I've noticed is that there's so many people on young-ish people on Tick Tock who are professionals that are crushing it so there's a like a bunch of dentists or orthodontist people tons and tons of chiropractors like there's lots of like Professional Services that are going viral on Tick Tock and if I'm in this position which I guess I kind of man am where I'm thinking like what else can we do Hampton for I was like man I could totally partner with some of these like and create a Hampton for doctors but to do a social network I was like I'm that's not my skill set so I'm not good enough to do that but I bet if I could like convince some crazy person like Nikita beer someone who knows about networking or networks Network effects I think you could actually build a substantial size business for Niche professional communities whether they're paying a small fee to be part of it or you build an ad Network on it um but I'm very fascinated by these like Niche communities for professional so services that are more than communities but like uh like LinkedIn Style yeah I think these are super hard and um would you do them they're obviously very very valuable any network is really really valuable once you create it but I think these are very very difficult it's really hard to have one idea which is why like I don't think there's like 10 ideas like this I think like right now there might be one or two ideas of this that might work which is why for the video one I got excited because I think that it's it's not always take all it's well it's clear that there's an industry where you need this and that showing how good I am as a video editor through my paper resume is bad so you need like you need a paper resume to not tell the story then you need for there to be a lot of people in that industry and a lot of people hiring for that industry that's the combo you need and that's why I think that this uh sort of dribble for video editors is a multi-hundred million dollar idea if somebody would uh would pull it off all right we kind of tag teamed that one a little bit what you want to go next here's a different kind of idea so here's an idea that I think would be um it's not doesn't require the internet you can turn off Wi-Fi and do this idea I like that it's not easy but it's also not really impossible either uh so it's somewhere in the middle um and also on the on the upside I think it's also like on the low end you make millions of dollars a year on the high end you make tens of millions of dollars a year so what if I told you that in San Francisco I discovered a business that does 31 million dollars in Revenue locally here in San Francisco no no no Revenue outside of San Francisco uh on that 31 million in Revenue it does about 11 million in profit and and it's brick and mortar brick and mortar wow and it has a hundred million dollars of assets on the balance sheet you want to take a guess on what kind of business this is well it's one of the things you've had listed but does it involve religion it does not no oh what is it it is a private elementary school so no way there are private elementary schools in San Francisco so so one I looked at a bunch of them uh the one the one I think that does the best or the one that I found that does the best is one called uh the Hamlin school and it's based in San Francisco it's a non-profit so you can see all the financials online but you can see this for for many of them and um it's just for girls it's it's a girls only School k through eight I think and uh only 450 kids so 450 girls go to the school you pay basically a college level tuition so parents pay forty thousand dollars a year to send their kid to kindergarten or first grade gosh damn 40 Grand are you gonna do that I'm not gonna I'm out of the city now but um the there's a lot of people that do because they have waitlist and hardcore admissions process if you want your kindergartner to get into school you have to dress up go to the interview prep them be like hey don't make a fool out of us we've been preparing you for four years for this come on perform do the thing and uh you send them in and they do an interview with them your your four-year-old does an interview oh I know this school I used to play basketball and they have a sick basketball hoop uh overlooking the city yeah yeah that's at the top of pack Heights and yeah yeah yeah and so there's a wait list of parents dying to get in and they own the buildings they own the real estate that they are that they operate out of which is why they have so much uh like so many so much value and assets on the balance because they own like huge properties in the prime spots of San Francisco um so and I looked at a bunch of these there's another one Burks and another one there's a whole bunch of these that that exist and they range from like you could see okay 20 20 21 how much revenue they do okay they did 15 million or 20 million in Revenue some are more profitable than others so Hamlet is particularly profitable but the other ones would be like 15 to 20 million in revenue and 2 million in profit um still not bad not bad at all and they and they would have 25 million in assets on the on the books and you could see who goes there because they have to list who donates so you can see the donations from different families oh that's the Facebook executive and this person is a a famous author and famous movie producer and whatever right so there's a whole how much do they donate like what's a big donation top donations are like low seven figures right now but I think you know like they did like uh we're gonna renovate the school and they raised 50 million dollars to renovate the school and that's donations outside of the tuition so that's just just please give us money so we can have a better building and you get to we'll name the library after you type the thing pretty insane um so there's a huge number of people because the public school system in San Francisco is not very good uh or considered to be not very good I have no idea what it actually is but that's the reputation it has um so I think there's an opportunity to do the following so so the good for them now what's the opportunity the opportunity is if you were ambitious enough you could look at and if you cared about this topic if you cared about this topic you really got to care about this [ __ ] because this is going to be yeah I don't know debatable I think you have to care enough um I don't think you have to like be born to educate I don't think you're you know you have to be whatever Miss Doubtfire here like you I think you have to be a smart person who is going to hold a standard just like you would for any other business a man dressed as an elderly woman you you definitely don't have to be in that that's that's not required in fact in fact you can't be that probably when I think about what the most ideal teacher is it's Miss Doubtfire so um a 40 year old so there's all these so commercial real estate is that like an all-time low in San Francisco there's empty buildings everywhere why because remote work it was too expensive and now these companies are basically just trying to get out of their leases so on one hand you have huge office buildings that are going vacant and on the other side totally dead down there right now uh no it's not totally dead but it's the lowest it's ever been so you know Buy Low if that's your strategy this is a good time to do it so I think you could buy one of these commercial or industrial buildings and convert it into a private elementary school now we're going to need a couple things we're going to need a name and a differentiator on the name side I got a few to throw at you you tell me which one you like well but let's just go look at a bunch of old shipwrecks that boogiest names I found here we go would you like your child to attend Windsor Oaks would you like your child to attend the prestigious Carrington school that one's nice and the other one is oh yeah yeah our daughter got into Thatcher Darby and if your daughter gets into thatchered RV you feel pretty good right now so are these just famous like streets in England I just looked up expensive ass last names that was my Google search and then I found a list of 100 and then I started pairing two together like Windsor Oakley and and Thatcher Darby um together so I think I got some some solid leads there the other thing is we need to differentiator and when I talk so I have some friends who who have kids that go to these schools and I asked them I said what what would you wish was different and they're like because I was like you're paying a crazy price I thought they would say something like price or teacher student ratios and they said they were like no no look these are all going to be expensive and in fact I'm fortunate I did well the number one thing I want to spend on is my kids education if I you know if there was a cheaper school I don't think we would switch because we would feel like well are we really going to try to go for like a lesser education I don't know this was a wait list the price is not the problem and I said teacher student ratio they said now it's six teachers for every one kid so on the 450 kids they have 75 teachers to run this school that does 30 million dollars you did it the wrong way six students per one teacher correct correct got it yeah six teachers for one student would be insane um so um though I said what's the biggest paintball they go you know what I hate to say this uh I I consider myself a a liberal person Live and Let Live but there's like an agenda in these schools and the agenda is like very woke so you know like our kids in elementary school have like they're being taught um you know that there are like you know what is gender you could be a boy but you're a girl they're like I just don't want my like first grader to be thinking oh I could I'm a girl but I could be a boy like that and this is in public schools right this is that the private school oh and so they're like you know and you know there's just such a heavy in influence they they said you know it's crazy in our elementary school there is um there are like uh clubs that are you know it sounds like what you would have at like maybe a a very liberal college but it's like yeah I don't feel like that has a place in elementary school just like kids be kids so the differentiator is going to be hey what happened to schools teaching math and science let's do that right that's what we're going to teach we're not going to teach political stuff we're not going to treat all these social issues like their kids let them be kids we're going to be a hardcore math science stem education School we're the best this one is no no that's this is that's what Thatcher Darby's gonna be um I love it hardcore Math Science and we don't subscribe to all we keep the the politics out of the school that's that's our only promise you're here to learn and we're going to learn these topics and uh we're not trying to shape your kids socially or politically in any way you and I have a friend who's got a well he's just turned he just became a teenager 13 and I said hey uh hey Brian how's school going uh you know it's about that age you're you're liking girls I bet you you anyone you'll have a crush on uh no it's not really working out well why not he goes they're all non-binary and uh I'm just like what because yeah there's only one that's heterosexual uh in assists or something like that but the rest are non-binary and the girl I like is non-binary so she said she can't be with me and I was like all right well that is a pain in the ass I don't know what to say to that yeah no advice I have no idea what you're talking about yeah yeah so what do you want to have for lunch like it was it like it it sounds really challenging honestly most of the times Generations will say like oh you have it so easy I had it so much harder when I was your age not true here I do not envy a 12 or 15 year old in in that at that age right and I I don't know if it's better or worse not really saying that but I do think there should be options in the market for what you want some some people really really do want their kid to be um exposed to a whole bunch of different issues it'd be a well-rounded human being and well-versed in a bunch of different issues and other people are like you know I don't really want my kid thinking about that I just really want them to have a good education learning about math science you know reading writing those things and I'd like the school to do that and I will handle the kind of like the outside of of those that curriculum type of education so I'm not saying what's your phrase it'll be like to be different where where well-roundedness goes to die or something like that hardcore science machines we don't like uh standardized testing we love it yeah so yeah you've got something here diversity here is Javascript all right that's cool but that's crazy that school makes that much money yeah who would have thought I didn't really think about like ever like oh create a school that that school if it's doing you know you know any of those schools those are basically like somewhere between 50 and 200 million dollar assets if you were to sell them maybe more if they one of them has 100 million dollars in assets on this balance sheet like um these are these are very big businesses that are just one location brick and mortar schools with 400 customers that's kind of amazing did I ever tell you about the time I was a telemarketer No so at my high school if you needed some money the best job was to be a telemarketer and what were we selling for what yeah what were we selling you ask we were begging for money and so what they would do is you would get paid ten dollars an hour but you'd get a commission and you get pizza and I worked that job for a year three nights a week and what they would do is every time you'd sit down at your desk in the evening they pay commission salary and pizza dear diary yeah that was the thing it was like I was 16 that was the thing we had dinner it was they had soda and pizza and you'd sit down at your desk I'd worked I worked there from like 3 P.M to like 8pm you sit down at your desk and you have a phone and then you just have a box of note cards and on the note cards it says how much the person donated previously what their resume is so where they worked and what their age is and what you would do after this is a little uh trick of the trade you find the oldest person there who's got the best career or who has previously donated the most amount of money and you line those up and you just start calling them and you say you know hey mister uh hey hey Mr Smith this is a Sam at Slough your alma mater I know you graduated here in 1956 um but look things are going great here but we need some money in order to build this thing or that thing can I count you down for a five thousand dollar donation you did three thousand dollars two years ago but times have changed my friend we got to step it up like you want to be a man for others or not now is the time and like we would like we had these scripts that we had to like sell these guys on giving us money to build something and I would bring in I don't remember the exact numbers but like tens of thousands of dollars a month in donations from these alumni and that was my job was just to call these guys constantly and we would do I don't know maybe 100 calls or something like that a night just trying to get this money and you would get like if you brought in five grand boom you got a hundred dollars like that's what we did and it was the greatest racket on it I don't remember exactly no we weren't making because the money had to go to the school was this legal or was like you know was there a janitor overseeing you what was going on here who was running this program I can't believe the history teacher who do you yeah as a history teacher that was that was like his side job his side hustle was running the Boiler Room you know he was the Jordan Belfort and I was like the little uh the little scrum or the little scrub just like you know smiling and dialing he's like you guys want some crackers yeah yeah workers are for closers on the phone part yeah you're like walk behind you like Sam is that a work call could you please uh can you please hang that up and your finger's broken why aren't you dialing bar but that's what I did it was awesome I mean don't you have that doesn't Duke people call you and usually what they do is now what they do is once you get old enough they hire your friends to be the person so like if we went to Duke together I'm gonna call Sean and be like hey Shawn what yeah so like my high school now I'll get texts from people who I was acquainted acquainted with and I'm friends with and here's the kicker they'll say [ __ ] like hey I know I follow you on social I know you're doing real well um you got a baby on the way you know that maybe yeah like so it's like do I flex right now like because I'm entirely driven by making my high school friends or my high school classmates like I want to be a big shot to them that's right because you know I got made fun of it that's all that's all I care about is is bringing it back to them but I Gotta Give five grand to this [ __ ] school they get me all the time it's been working so effectively but that's how these telemarketing things work you don't get calls from duke asking to give money hey it's dude lose my number parking up the wrong tree never happening can't believe I gave you the money I gave you the first place yeah man it's like a pretty funny uh thing I mean that's how I have a multi-billion dollar endowment you gotta lose my number you're not calling me for money that's not [ __ ] right if my high school or something called me all right maybe I hope they don't but you know I I wouldn't really feel as aggressively upset as I do if do calls if your number could also be a country's GDP you're if your endowment could be confused with like a Caribbean country it's jealous yeah yeah yeah yeah we're out like you should not call me yeah size 12 billion is it really 12 billion and Duke's not even like a dare say good level there's a good level it's a mid major it's definitely a mid major it's not even a good school I made a Duke top 20. it's top 20 for sure right yeah it is yeah is it but is it top 20 thing in terms of endowment yeah I think so I think so that is insane billions of adults billions of dollars in endowment they could basically just run the school off the uh investment income oh yeah totally uh I'm surprised that um more people I'm surprised that anyone gives to these to these schools I don't understand at all all right so the top yeah it's in the top 20. so Harvard number one is 40 billion Yale two at 30 Texas 30 Stanford 27 and then at the bottom of the top 20 is Cornell with 7 million that's insane that is insane that's that's ridiculous yeah I don't know why those guys would be calling you but I bet they do they need your fifty dollars [Music] see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better well I'll tell you about one of the really smart ideas was this thing called uh got the name of the parent company Ben see if you can find it it's uh they made this thing called Tower view Venture so one of the big streets at Duke campus is Tower View and it's like the name of some magazine there or something like that it's like a it's like a reference to something we remember from from school and it's basically Tower view Ventures we're raising money for uh for adventure fund to invest in alumni from duke it's like oh yeah Duke has really smart people um so you know we are going to invest those companies they've had these winners before Cameo and blah blah blah blah and they basically do this for they spin this up for every single top school it's called I think alumni Ventures and they just spin up small funds for every single school and um and then they just run ads and call you try to get you to donate try to get you to invest in their fun and they're like cool we're just gonna have like like tarvery Ventures they have uh I guess started in 2019 there's uh you know it's on fun five now for for the Duke one and like I don't know how big These funds are but like even if they're like 10 million 10 million dollar funds or 20 million dollar funds you take two percent every year of management fees and twenty percent of carry across this times 50 other schools it's like a pretty genius way to like pull a large rate of so it's a real business school but there's are are they does the school give them permission to use their name well they don't use their name they say we're Tower of Avengers and we're investing in Duke alumni so they're not saying but they very much make it dude colors match it's like here's all your school colors everything is like uh uh you know based off that that's a scheme that's a that's a hardcore scheme right you could do that for Belmont well I mean like like a 50 000 fun Ain't Gonna Go Far do you think you're like Bail Bonds most successful alumni from your year yeah yeah uh no I got beat you know who it was who Florida Georgia Line what you know that Florida Georgia line that band no you've never heard of Florida Georgia territory that was annexed Florida Florida Georgia Line is like if you go to just your Spotify right now and like you look in the top 100 songs I bet most years they have one or two songs yeah you know it's on cruise like even Nelly made an appearance I mean you're just dude do you know who Nelly is would you like to pants me right now in front of everybody you know I don't know who any of these people are I know Nelly but yeah it's like Mike Posner was in my ear and uh you know no do you know Morgan Wallen do you know who that is he's the [ __ ] I love that guy they're more famous than Morgan Wallen oh wow so not not to you but they put they helped put Morgan Wallen on the map because Morgan Wallen appeared on one of their songs anyway they're like a Morgan Wallen famous band so they might be number one I think I might be number two but you know what they never [ __ ] call me I got mad at them because here's let me explain why I got mad at him my mom was gonna come and watch me graduate but I didn't finish school on time and I asked like the teachers or whatever I was like can you just give me like a fake diploma and just let me come on stage and not tell her and I'll finish it at another point and they're like no it's a tradition you have to we have to literally hand you your diploma there I'm like just give me an empty folder I don't I don't just I literally just want to be there on stage just let me have that empty folder and they wouldn't let me do it and so forever I'll wow I hate Belmont because they wouldn't let me just walk in the stage and just let me shake that guy's hand and turn the [ __ ] stupid Beret thing to the side and they wouldn't do it so I I will always be mad at Belmont for that reason wow what an L for them all right I got I got a couple more so um let me see where I want to go okay can I can I just rapid fire for you some ideas go we don't even have to discuss them okay uh exporting and you know my import export framework my import framework and expert framework is uh if you're at a company and you wish some you're like dude we would totally pay for this that's a business idea you would want to import you're better off going and starting that business because it's probably 100 other businesses like you that would pay for that or export is we we built this for ourselves and it's so useful you're better off leaving the company and then rebuilding that on the outside of the walls and selling it to other companies so here's what slack did um yeah exactly slack is a good example of this um uh so Paul Graham tweeted this out the other day that like YC has its own directory internally about Investors where any startup founder can go look up any investor and read their reviews or kind of like what's the scoop on this person have they done anything effed up are they really helpful what's their you know what do we know about this person and he's like this is one of the best products that YC has and I'm like why is that a product only YC has um this should be a product that anybody has so I think somebody should export this out and it's like Yelp for investors where investors have a reputation on this uh in this app and it's all you can only write about them if you had you know like let's say a a verified interaction with them or something like that dude that's great I think I wish I could have that for a variety of vendors the things that people ask for most at Hampton is like hey who's a good lawyer who's it a good accountant who's this who's that it's incredibly challenging to find reviews on vendors including investors it's super hard to start these types of businesses but I think the one uh the startup Community is so insulated that you could actually overcome the chicken and egg problem through Brute Force because there's not that many investors and you could find you can quickly see who's worked with them just by looking at their portfolio and you could cold email them and be like give me the scoop and I think you could manually collect the data to get this going um all right here's another one teacher's pet is what I'm calling this so this is my first AI idea for you here so um you're aware of teachers paid teachers which is a Marketplace it's like Etsy but instead of buying and selling handcrafted Goods you buy and sell lesson plans quizzes things that teachers need Teachers Pay Teachers have you ever heard of this we talked about it a while we talked about it a while ago right it's a big business so it was doing like 80 million dollars a year in Revenue that's like their take not the gmv that's their their take and it gets like 20 million visits a month during school years um 300 teachers on this network have made a million dollars or more um by selling lessons or selling quizzes or selling classroom materials to other teachers so like their new profile pictures like [ __ ] them kids I'm a Creator so like these marketplaces are big and marketplaces for the most part are pretty unassailable it's very hard to go compete with something that has a network effect I think AI is one of these things that might be able to crack some Network effects and I think AI could crack this one so I think you could train AI to crawl and learn from all of the materials on this network you can just go buy all the materials on this for probably like less than five hundred thousand dollars um and then you could use that as your training data and you could train AI to basically become chat GPT for teachers so you so any teacher should be able to come to this and instead of going through and finding what's a good geography lesson plan and then going and buying it for fourteen dollars you just go ask this thing hey I need a geography lesson plan for fourth grade um make it fun and interesting and it should just create one for you so I think if you created this you could have a 20 a month subscription just for teachers to create lesson plans using AI or quizzes or teaching materials or whatever teachers teachers ticket name too yeah you want to do you have one more I'm big on providing a name with some with these ideas uh I think that that really turns it from like a uh I don't know to like where's the application form for Thatcher garbage what's this you just have this funny phrase it's for some reason funny to me you call it in ozepik on-ramp and then an ozempic off-ramp yeah so these aren't fully baked ideas but I'll just spitball it with you all right so when I was thinking about this you know um you want to surf on waves if you're starting a business so what's a wave you could surf right now oh zempic I think ozempic is like If Video is a megatrend guess what fat loss is amazing have you tried it yet no no I haven't tried it but um I know a lot of people that want to be on it or get off of it or are I got a guy I got a guy I could refer him no no it's expensive though it's expensive yeah I'm not interested but I know a lot of people are so I guess the question is um what could you build around this ozempic Mega Trend so um my brain goes to on-ramps and half ramps how do you sell something to people that makes it easier to get it or help people get off of it so for forgetting it uh if you go Google just like um I don't know like how do I take ozempic or like getting ozempic near me you get a bunch of like kind of like uh sponsored links for like Telehealth services that are gonna try to like uh you know sign up for this here's the pills basically but what I think somebody should do is I think somebody should go old school with it I think somebody needs to create a ozympic hotline and what's the Olympic hotline so the Olympic hotline is old school infomercial [ __ ] so you're gonna run ads on linear TV on Fox News you're gonna be the my pillow guy you're just gonna be everywhere that like people who are like you know 40 to 60 are are clicking and uh or watching and you're just going to show people's Transformations and oozepic and be like call in now to you know get a free consultation are you eligible what are the upsides what are the downsides how much does it cost where can you find it so confusing we are going to make it easy we're gonna give you a free consult and you basically just become a lead gen provider for people who are trying to buy exempting but I think you got to do like 1 800 like got abs or something like that right like 1-800 you know but that goes against all your principles since you hate which principles uh I like to say whatever we could find them somewhere deep in that closet uh but I believe one or two of those principles besides which is coming out of left field the fact that you said that you don't want to kill animals to eat that that that's that's such a uh curveball coming from you but I think the other one was I think you hate Pharmaceuticals no uh no I don't hate Pharmacy I don't personally take I don't personally uh try to take a lot of stuff I try not to be dependent on anything um you know as a general rule like caffeine I don't drink coffee I don't do I don't do a lot of stuff like that um you know people take like you know I don't know you you love stuff you're like oh I'm I need nicotine I need this I did I love carbonated waters and Diet Coke yeah so I'm I try not to be on any of that stuff but um but people are this is a business opportunity I'm not doing this I'm saying somebody could create a phone-based way to educate people and help onboard people or on the other side you could figure out an off-ramp so so a lot of people want to stop this either it's too expensive or they're having side effects or or they just feel like they got the weight loss they had they don't want to keep taking this forever how do you off ramp and uh I don't know the answers to that but that's well I'll tell you the place to go look what's the answer you just don't take it nothing bad happens you just don't take it yeah but I don't I don't like people try to regain a bunch of weight right away or have like any sort of like I don't know nothing nothing that's this effective has no cost when you stop I I don't believe that yeah so basically the the when the the study that they did was they took two or three thousand people they had them do it for six months and then after six months they had half the people quit taking it and what they found was uh at the end of the 12-month study uh the people took it the whole time lost um something like a third of their body weight so like a 300 pound person was 200 pounds and then the people who quit taking it they went from 200 pounds back up to like 230 or something like that so they gained weight back but they weren't nearly as fat as they were when they started so they but they did gain weight but so yeah an off ramp is fine but I don't think you have like uh withdrawals like this is not gonna kill you you're just gonna like be like Oh I'm hungry like I want to eat again yeah and maybe it's just like peer groups or something I don't know is there something you could provide to this large group of people that all have now like one they're going through this one new experience and I don't know there's got to be auxiliary things around it that's so that's that's a place I would look for business ideas um all right I gotta I got another one for you I heard something the other day they just really caught my attention I think it's a cool idea but it's being done in the wrong way so let's listen to some podcasts um and the guy who was talking and it was like yeah I did mind support and blah blah and he started talking about mind support I was like mine's what a great name what is that and he was a really smart guy and he was talking about Game Theory and blah blah blah and I looked it up and my sport is essentially the nerd Olympics so mindsport is a place that you go if you're uber smart and um you compete with people in those games and so those games can range from chess to Poker to Sellers of Catan or go or whatever or like Rubik's Cube yeah like you know if I was like let's just put it this way Sam if I was to tell you um you know but this I could solve this cube in the next you know 90 seconds you might not think I'm a genius but you probably don't think I'm an idiot would that be fair all right are you gonna solve that right now is that gonna be part of the show because that would be great I wish I could solve this I have never even gotten close I don't know what the hell you're supposed to do with this thing I treated like a fidget spinner just move it and I'm like oh that's cool I got two blues and three yellows that's awesome on the back and then move on yeah this so there's the Mind Sports Olympiad the uh you're you're in the special mind Sports Olympian I'm in the mind jog mine's not moving that fast um so so basically you go to this thing and you compete in all these games oh you can be in your game but you can also compete in the pentamind championship which is where you're gonna play five of these games and I'm like oh my God you know Coachella for nerds and I was like this is amazing um and I just I cannot tell you Sam par how all in I am on the Mind sport Olympiad I want to go I want to watch it live like I watch the spelling bee live on ESPN I want to watch The Hard Knocks documentary about like you know following five of these people behind the scenes and watching them stress out about this I want to adopt one of the kids in this and just have them be like you know my 17 year old child um and most of all I want to hire all these kids this is so wrong business model this is not a tournament with prize money and thanks to our sponsors Wendy's no no no no no you've got this all wrong this is a recruiting event for the elite Minds under 25 years old and I was like this is bait to bring together the smartest nerds in five years these kids are not going to be playing professional Settlers of Catan they're going to be starting companies or working inside companies and guess where I want them to work my companies and so I think that you should take this idea create a version of this but it needs to be a elite recruiting service slash job fair slash demo day for nerds and you need to basically when they attend they need to basically somehow like sign over the rights for you to like send them job offers for the next five years or like you know get to invest in them or something like that because I can't think of a more valuable talent pool then the mindsport Olympics you could do this for gamers in general I love investing one of my secrets of investing is I invest in former competitive Gamers um you know people who were Elite level at you know Starcraft or things like that those people just tend to do really really well at whatever next game you throw in front in front of them and once you throw the money game in front of them guess what they solve it they figure it out um and so there's this listen there's this thing called the world memory championships have you heard of this no sign me up yeah and so they've been doing this since 1990 1991 and there's a different game so basically we're gonna get you we're just gonna give you thousands of numbers and you have five minutes and you have to tell us like in order the numbers and the record for that is 600 numbers and they only had five minutes to do it the one hour number is the same thing except you have one hour to do it and and the guy who won that did 4 600 numbers in a row you remembered that and so they do these 10 different games and in the same way that the UFC used to be like this like a bunch of thugs fighting like it was like barbarians but now it's like the it's like it's half WWE and WWF where it's like you know you slept at my wife now I'm gonna beat you up at his other half like a movement yeah your movement is magical look at his movement it's so smooth this is Pete physical performance we need uh we need Dana White you know or a visit man to buy the world memory championships and we got to make that great because I'm looking up the guy who won it Alex Mullen he's a he's a kid or no he's or I guess when he won it he was 28. you know what he does for work now he's an x-ray person at a hospital X-ray tech X-ray tech memories why is this guy not working but like rain is HIPAA compliant what are we talking about yeah why is this guy not working for like you know black rock or Blackstone Just Like Rain Man in his way to like you know corporate bias I'm saying baby undervalued assets these are these are hidden gems uh I'm not all in on memory because I think memory is like the pleb version of the the Olympiad like these other guys are like strategists but like memory is you know any rube can do memory really um I can't even remember seven numbers let alone 600. I can remember two-thirds of any phone number uh yeah so that's that's one idea um okay I got a couple other for you um let me hit you with with one more maybe but we were out of time here but I'm gonna I'm gonna go into overtime here and give you one more um let's do one around churches okay so something you know a lot about another area that I'm completely unversed with but I know that other people do it um Michael girdley tweeted this out the other day he said uh 3 500 churches are closing every year well what's what's that about what is that number and um it's not exactly right actually like what happens is four thousand churches closed last year but like another 3000 or 2 000 opened or something like that it's like a net change of 1500 churches uh but but towards the negative and there is a bunch of there are a bunch of stats about this so um in the CR you know in in traditional churches so the Christian churches attendance is down 65 in the last 20 years 65 um and what happens is when the pews are empty there's less donations so then these churches end up having to close down and uh there's a trend basically they call them like are you are you Christian are you Jewish are you Muslim what are you and there's a there's a group called The Nuns they're just none I don't know why they're calling them nuns instead of like sort of like atheists or whatever like wait nuns like n-u-n or n-o-n-n-e yeah that's all that's that's also confusing when you said nuns that's like a bunch of ladies in like comments honestly big slip up on their part yeah they could be the zeros survey them and for Gen Z I guess 45 would count as as none of the above essentially for for religion and this guy who um studies churches whatever said that of the three 350 000 Christian congregations in the United States one-third are like vulnerable on the brink of collapse basically like one-third are like in the red zone and over the next 10 years will likely close that's a huge number and what are the opportunities so I think that there's I think you could approach this from multiple angles so again not a specific idea but I do think you could look at this when you hear a stat like that that's just that's just one that gets your attention like when Jeff Bezos heard the stat that like you know the internet is growing at twelve thousand percent a year he's like oh I better go start Amazon and basically I think you could do that around around stats like this so how are these churches going to close down um that in itself the sort of the vulture business or the cleanup is the funeral business for churches I think is kind of interesting how are the how forget saving it might help them help them die with Grace in my neighborhood uh one block from my house in St Louis they turned a church into a condo right yeah exactly so then I found there's this group called Niagara Consulting Group and they're basically like we help you restructure your church what do they mean by that it's basically look there's a lot of developers that are chomping at the bit to turn this into luxury condos like we help you try to succeed but if you don't we'll get you an offer from one of these developers to turn this into luxury condos and I was like oh interesting but in a lot of places they can't even do that because it's like you know like low low income areas that there's not real they just sit there empty um so I think there's a lot of opportunity to figure out how to deal with this I think there's opportunity if I'm a company like calm could I take 50 million dollars and just buy physical locations across the country in one year through these searches and just have a weekly service for meditation and whatever like um even have like like you know just local chapters basically franchisees that are going to run them um so I think there's there's something to be done here whether it's trying to save them trying to help them fail gracefully figuring out what's a what's a pivot you could do for a lot of these I saw you just put a little Link in here what you got so that's uh that's ten Doors Down from my childhood home or my mom and dad still live um beautiful it's a church that they turned into a seven eight thousand square foot house and as a house it doesn't look that cool but as like a meditation area like it does look cool as an Airbnb fantastic you know yeah but look it's 1.2 million dollars and it's a 8 000 square foot I mean it's in St Louis Missouri where I'm from which isn't that nice but they this company renovated this church into like a livable house and then I met these other guys who turned one into a skate park they turned an old church into a skate park um and so it's like it is pretty fascinating because a lot of these buildings are kind of cool but to have like the Church of calm that's kind of dope and then if you're gonna help them I think this is gonna be a side hustle so like church near us they actually have like awesome events all the time and I love to take our kids to it because it's like they just put on great events wholesome fun events for families and kids but it's so hard to even know what the hell like literally the only way I know is if I drive by they have a little sign they put like in the front like a for sale sign but it'll be like we're doing something this Saturday it's gonna have popcorn and bouncy houses like oh I'm in but I only catch it driving by I'm like these guys just don't know social media and um I had to call them to be like hey if I'm like an Indian dude who's not a member of the church can I still come get the free popcorn like you know what's the deal around this are you like are your doors open yeah they're gonna have like a color swatch yeah come in like you're not white enough exactly like do you need to have recognized me you know like how does this work and so I couldn't even get a hold of them because I was like they just they have like one old Facebook page with like you know an event from 2014. and I'm like dude churches need better social media and I was like I think you could just create like done done for you social media services for churches if you wanted to get like a 10 to 20 000 a month side hustle I think you could just do that just by going to every single church just walk in and be like hey your social media is not very good I can make it look like this and then you basically go on Shepard you hire somebody for 800 a month and that person is going to manage 20 churches social media as for you because all the churches do hey it's the same schedule it's every Sunday um same templates you just need their color their name and you need to know like what's going on for them like you know just manage all of their Instagram and um you know like social media accounts for them so I think that's one that like it's not that nobody's doing that but there's plenty of churches that are not on board that if you just wanted to go sign up a bunch of clients for 300 to 400 a month you could do that did you do you remember this so have you heard of a hill song like when I uh uh it's like Hillsong Church yeah um when I was living in Tennessee I've been an Atheist forever but I was like a lot of cute girls are going to this I guess I guess that's the price to be that's the price they gotta pay so I'll go to this like so I went to this thing to like meet some people and uh that's how I kind of learned about it but for in the later 2000s there was this guy who somehow infiltrated Justin Bieber's camp and he like became Justin Bieber's like Mentor uh Carl Lentz and there's a new Netflix show about him but basically he's like he's like he's like a smoking hot guy like you know he looks basically like Justin Bieber in his 40s like he looked great I don't describe most men as babes but he's a babe well he's a babe I mean like objectively like you know like you're either seven foot tall or you're not like he's seven feet tall he's tall I think I uh messaged you once about him and you were like dude he's got the thing like you know like the the diagonal lines that just point to your crotch it's like it's like an AB line that you only have if you're super rip he's got those what kind of Pastor has those yeah if you're a pastor and you have that V it's bad news and as as one could just look at his V and guess he did some uh I don't know if he did any illegal things I don't I didn't frankly I didn't watch the documentary I don't know I don't think it was rape I think he just cheated on his wife and yeah they just had sex with just everyone [Laughter] might do he's also super charismatic super good looking um has like a you know a huge following from being on stage in front of 10 000 people every week or whatever you know it he's a mega celebrity he was yeah he's the mega celebrity but he made Hillsong cool like I even went to one of those things uh because this girl I was trying to date was like come to this thing their music is great yeah so I went I went to that thing just to be with this girl and it wasn't worth it didn't work out but uh but yeah that's how I learned about some of this religion stuff dude where I'm from St Louis all the Catholic churches are dying man the the all the Catholic schools are are going by the wayside one of the more useful things that I learned when I moved to Silicon Valley was a new way of looking at businesses that I hadn't really ever heard before outside of Silicon Valley which is you most products are actually a bundle not a product most things are a bundle and once you can identify what's in the bundle you could figure out how to unbundle that service and make something better so for example uh Peter Thiel went on a spree where he was talking about how universities are a bubble how the university system is overrated he was going to launch the teal Fellowship which would pay you two hundred thousand dollars to drop out of school and do something useful with your life and that's where figma came from and that's where Oil rooms came from that's where you know vitalik the creator of ethereum was it he was a teal I think there's been 10 billion dollar companies so far have come from it really actually a very impressive track record and so one of the things he said was that they're like how could you you know it was it was sort of like taboo to say like you know who says like anything against school right like everybody's message is basically stay in school kids and he's saying drop out of school kids and so they're like give you money how dare you and he's like well the university is a bundle it's like it's partially um education so there are there is education it's partially um socialization so you know you go there to learn how to like party and be with other kids and date and get drunk and all that stuff it's partly um babysitting so it's basically my kids not old enough they're not mature enough to get to the real world yet it's like four years over here let them simmer a little bit then they'll be ready he's like it's partly insurance which is like a societal Insurance like uh look I don't care what you do just get a degree get a college degree because that label that stamp is going to be whatever he's like it's partly um accreditation so like I don't care if you're the top student at Harvard but if you got into Harvard that's a signal that's strong enough for me as an employer to know that you're smart right like if I know you went to Harvard it's a signaling thing so he's like you're actually buying all of these things when you buy into University when you pay the crazy cost of University and we have to ask ourselves what part of that bundle is actually important what part of the bundle is failing is it actually a weak part of the bundle that could be unbundled and so what he did was he switched the accreditation one he's like cool what if I created something I have a brand Peter teal I invest in Facebook I created PayPal what if I hand-picked you know 40 of the most promising college kids and paid them 200 Grand to leave school now I've instead of having just like some normal school badge which is good you get the teal hand-picked badge which is even more Elite so I'm gonna like unbundle the university give you a more Elite badge um and then I'm gonna get rid of all the rest I don't care about the socialization I don't care about the rest I'm gonna be 10x better at this badge and uh you know like YC is 10x better at University in certain things than in others and so that's brilliant yeah so the question is what is the church bundle the church bundle is a combination of lecture for learning Community a place to gather and congregate every week it's just a peaceful place like I like going to church I used to go to church not for like I kind of like the sermon but I just love the feeling of being inside of a church the aura of inside of a church was just very peaceful and grounding to me um so it's a peaceful place it's also therapy slash confession uh so a place to get things off your chest um and and kind of with that is like being absolved of your sins like just getting a clean slate I think oh okay I feel less guilty um you know there's music so some people go for the music Vibes some people go for the food like Indian temples all have like free food I don't know if churches have that or not but like Indian temples like a lot of people I know go because they actually like love the meal uh but it's plus a good thing um you show your loyalty to God and so if you take this bundle of a bunch of things also dating I I put this on there like I know a bunch of people that like they kind of want to meet someone who has maybe their values or is like right you know like sure yeah it's like matches in some way and they're like oh this is better than going and trying to approach someone in a bar where it's noisy and I'm getting rejected like oh what if I like this is a new sort of like social scene where I can go approach somebody all right so I think one big so the small version of this idea is like social media for churches the medium version of this is like restructure these churches into condos or figure out some lead gen where you maybe you you help them as they wind down to sell off assets or something the big version of this idea is figure out how you're going to replace the value that churches gave people but you do it in a new way and so like for example could you create a new brand in these same venues that's around I don't know like manifestation or some [ __ ] like that or meditation or um yoga like could you create a yoga franchise that only operates out of churches and some blend of life that's cool religion and churches right I start religion and yoga and like I think those are the Big Ideas which is replace the function one of the like be 10x better on one of those bundles like 10x

yeah tell me about um Mr Beast he like is is so unique in the fact that he is laser focused in a way that I've never really experienced and and maybe at times like in in a way that I don't want to experience yeah yeah so he doesn't want to know [Music] Colin and I you know spent a lot of our career making documentaries and what we noticed was like if we were interviewing a subject and we were just interviewing them head on we wouldn't get good answers and then we started taking them like driving or have them do something else and then you would get the truth it was really interesting it's like the truth comes out in the car I think it's something that uh some documentarians say where it's like if someone's doing something else they're much more open if their mind isn't 100 on right the interview uh why is that you think they're just performing basically when they sit down in a like a artificial environment probably yeah there's a lot of like self perception stuff that's going on right it's like how am I coming across who am I is the sounding right and if you're distracted then you but you guys do your interviews at a table basically yeah so you don't do that well we've been trying to explore like the concept of creating the right energy for the conversations right yeah like you think about like this has a completely different energy than if there was a table has a completely different energy than if we didn't have mics and we were laughed or had booms so we've been trying to explore like where our show is moving and what type of space we want that's essentially exactly where I wanted to start which is basically you guys do so we came down here and we were like oh let's get like a place let's have some in-person interviews with people that we think are awesome and uh it's different than the like at home thing for sure right the vibe is different you get a different energy but also you can do like high stakes interviews almost it's like the whole day kind of gets built around this interview which is not really the case we do it online and um you guys have been doing some high stakes interviews so you're doing stuff with uh I mean just recently I just saw the Tim Ferriss one that was great and I'm guessing you're like me that you grew up kind of like really into Tim ferriss's stuff and you know kind of admire him yeah it was pretty surreal that's a that's a high stakes interview you did Mr Beast you did dream we did a bunch of these things first do you prefer like being the interviewee or in this case you're kind of like more the guest on the on the show do you prefer guest or host I like to talk so like I like when we are the host and it is a conversation I think that's the most fun for me like I do I am a naturally curious person and you know along with higher Stakes it's also like very very interesting people that I'm inherently curious about right so that to me is really fun I think where it's you know where it gets challenging is if you don't have chemistry but we actually now do pre-calls and kind of not like chemistry reads but we try and gauge yeah what our chemistry is with the with the guest because we've been in situations where the chemistry is not good and then you're like okay how do I like where do we go from here how does this work uh and and when you're the producer of the show or it's your show in the middle of it you're like okay is this gonna perform voice in your head how do I edit this how does it and that then puts you into a hole like a disadvantage yeah you're so let's say you're doing one of these kind of like interviews you're pumped for uh I'll call it a high stakes interview yeah how do you kind of walk me through how you're preparing for that and how you're like just kind of like getting ready to perform that yeah yeah actually we've been really trying to establish our relationship with prep because we found that sometimes if we're overly prepped I'm barely listening to the other person I just know where I'm going talking point yeah I know where I'm going um and also how much of them I listened to Prior because if I know their stories I know they're beats I'm kind of like right you know a bit curiosity yeah the Curiosity Wayne so um been trying to explore that relationship we do have it like we have a team that essentially develops a research dockly with someone on our team who does that he's like here's here's kind of like some origin story and we we structure it like a act one act two act three structure where where is their origin story what's the inflection point right where has that put them today right because it's like what was the tense part of the journey what what didn't work for them do we know any of that is there something we can ask about that creates an inflection point because we are trying to tell a story with it yeah so we need to know the general themes of what's happening in the origin right the Act One what's happening in the conflict the Act 2 and then the resolution and the future right um so that's like the most outgoing all the details without knowing all the details yeah um so yeah we're trying to establish a new relationship with that of how much is it like curiosity and how much is it prep uh and I think that's become more substantial for us as the landscape of interview shows is getting more and more saturated right like when we interviewed um you know certain creators three years ago no one else was interviewing creators so it was kind of like okay this is a talk show for our own Community right it doesn't exist anywhere else now we're a part of a group and that then pushes you to try and become more singular and more differentiated and chemistry how you show up who the hosts are matters right I think you guys have done actually a really good job of that I think about your show a lot because I think tell me more what are we doing well well I think you have to be it's similar because there's two hosts right um which is really hard which is really hard in interviews but probably you have a better reception when it's just you and Sam yeah on a lot right it's like when you're building a show that's guest dependent um or all about the guest bookings it's like some people will look at this and be like I don't know who that is so I'm not going to click on it some people give it a chance because they trust you um but really if if it's you and Sam you can carry the show and then you become less reliant on booking so I do think like Colin and I've been thinking a lot about that how do we instill some of that how do we think about that but we are just like the show takes us to really interesting people like Tim Ferriss and so right now in this moment yeah you keep writing it like this is cool the type of Outreach we have is really cool the people we get to talk to is really cool so you said something like uh how do I show up yeah um I think about this a lot because when it comes to like sports we're used to an athlete having like a pre-game routine immediately nap a stretch thing a warm-up they're wearing the headphones they're listening to their song yeah they get the motivational speech they run up they run out there they do the warm-ups and then they play yeah and but for other types of people who need to perform it's like what are you doing why do you need to do that just sit down and talk right it seems so easy it's definitely presence like you have to become very present right in the conversation and so there's there's a couple different things to to try to do that for me personally I've discovered this 11 minute Wim Hof breath work nice online that's it I think it's brutal I do that a lot have you done it yeah yeah there's so many people who know this exact one it's like 11 minutes it's like it's free YouTube like top ranked YouTube and he's his accent is amazing come on all right guys yeah it's so good uh and like that just gets me in the zone like I love that thing I want to do that right now oh my gosh yeah do you do it laying down yeah or do you do it laying down that's his way on your back so we made a documentary about whim years ago and so like I've just been which one I've never seen it it's uh it's on yes Theory's channel it's all called Frozen alive Colin and I actually edited it okay um yes yes this is it it's so good so good yeah so lie down sit down whatever it takes by the way this is good as a like uh I do this like whenever I have like a team Retreat or like we need to do something um I'll be like hey guys like if you're if you're down let's do something a little bit weird and then yeah their boy like what is he gonna say and this is not so weird they're down with it and you you definitely feel energized right at the end of it yeah I just try and get present like I try and take out a lot of the variables I think as we've built a team what's been great is like it used to be me and Colin being like okay where do the mics go where do the cameras go does the lighting look good um and that can be really stressful yeah I mean for example our most recent interview with Mr Beast when we went out to North Carolina you know we were there for a full day prepping for the Pod but at the last minute realized we didn't have a table and Colin and I went to a furniture store in North Carolina two hours before we sat down with him and we're just scrambling to buy a table and then assemble it had to arrange for it to be delivered and basically it all happened within a matter of you know that was a very stressful two hours prior to sitting down and I felt very not present in the first half of that right you know I was I was just coming off like okay that that was intense why didn't I think of that kind of immediately already being retrospective of the process of you know and so all of that stuff I think you just have to eliminate I made a bunch of mistakes like that when uh this this podcast started with me doing long form interviews like the first 20 episodes was just me interviewing people at a studio and whatever and I I kind of like got reps there and then it switched at like I don't know episode something 40 or something like that to me and Sam as like a recurring thing which was like way different prep you know TurnKey TurnKey set up already have good chemistry um don't have to book gas don't have to research cast just like being ready to talk about interesting things and like just turn up the the sort of Charisma as much as you can but now that I got back into being like all right let's try to like we have this amazing Network these are Fascinating People to talk to let's just let's do it and I I told Ben I called Ben after the first one I was like dude that was like an hour too long because I did three hours I was like I thought I was Joe Rogan for a minute there I did three hours way too long um and then I was like I over prepped like crazy and the thing you were saying where you're like yeah I'm listening but in my head I'm like okay I'm supposed to be to this next I was like that wasn't right and so it's hard before this we went to Dave and Buster's in between interviews and uh you know played Papa shot and I got in a good good Zone and now I'm here it's either that or Wim Hof you know Dave mustard yeah if you don't have a local Dave and Busters if you're unfortunate enough I thought you're gonna say if you don't have a local women yeah you always got whim um you've had a bunch of these yes who's somebody that's been a lot of fun uh that you guys have had on recently that's like you know giving you those kind of like mind-blown brains leaking out my ear like who's done that for you recently yeah it's hard to not say Tim um Tim Ferriss school but tell me what was dope about the Tim one with Tim it was the fact that he's been doing this for so long and and um he really opened my eyes to this concept of having a very high quality audience and I look at Tim and I think he has like an incredibly high quality audience um and I think we make a lot of sacrifices because we distribute our stuff on YouTube for viewership right right like it is it's very odd that we have public performance metrics next to our work there's very few other places where that happens right like in business it doesn't happen where you're like here's how well I'm doing and anyone can see that at any time if you go to a Shopify store it doesn't just show you sales yeah how many sales has this have exactly the truest rawest like Benchmark imagine walking into a grocery store and it just has like you know Revenue under every product it's just it's a very odd thing that pushes us to make decisions for larger viewership rather than higher quality of your ownership and I think sitting with Tim uh it was a deep understanding of how he's built a very high quality premium audience and a premium brand over a decade and I think he said something in that interview to you he was like um there's always a market for like the best the best yeah and he's like so I wanted whatever the ads were priced at I was gonna go like double that and be like that's how do I get that to be the thing because that will always be there there will always be a market for whoever's got the highest quality audience with the best ad read you know that's that'll always be there and I think that's played out yeah and I think uh what's important is to for us as creators just to realize like what we are doing is not novel it's been done before we're building audiences we're media companies you know this has been done before and we should look far back at who's done it really well yeah you know and I I think that sitting with Tim was that opportunity and you know almost as a self-fulfilling prophecy like the type of people who reached out to us after the Tim episode really was emblematic of it is a high quality audience that watches Tim and that's interested in him it was not our highest performing episode right but it's one of my favorite and it's one that drove a lot of high quality Outreach right and it reminded me of that of of we can get really caught up in you know High viewership but I think that was something that that really pushed me in there's a lot of stuff in there there's something that I never forget that he said which was um if you do something that is even slightly energy depleting it will compound over time um and to like really look at your day-to-day and recognize what is depleting your energy because it'll compound everything when you say that it's like I feel like everybody can think of like the one thing right away yeah that you haven't been like really paying that much attention to but when prompted your brain is like of course it's this yeah and this is you know this is four hour work week from his book but he talked a lot about who are the right clients to have like what you know money is not we look at it as such like well it's a lot of money so I'll sacrifice these things for it but if if the client relationship isn't good if it's depleting your energy if it's causing a strain on your team it's not worth it and all those viewpoints are almost antithetical to our the internet age of us being like all of this is infinite right you know we can always be making more money we should always be pursuing more viewership More Money More Of Everything uh he came in with the perspective of what's the right money what's the right right so he said that energy depleting thing what did you think of for you I thought of um like meetings yeah I'm like a creative person I like to be creative and I've kind of just spun myself up to be like we run a media company so I need to operate like a media company owner and like I think about hosting meetings or being on Zoom calls and I'm like I I really don't like it right at all so on the podcast once did a really funny rant where he was like you know he's like long build up he was like you know I've been uh you know we sold the hustle this many months ago it's been six months I've talked to this person this person I thought about all these things you know what I realized I'm a [ __ ] artist man and I was like it's not what you think is coming when he when he says it and he also doesn't like like he doesn't come across like an artist like some people that the way they dress what they do you're like that's an artist yeah and he's like I'm a [ __ ] artist man I just need to create and I'm going to keep doing that no matter what the situation is I I should have they said be an investor I tried I don't want to do that I don't want to do that [ __ ] you know I stopped doing it all together I just want to be an artist and uh I think about that a lot actually I think there's like a a great way to like kind of draw a line in the sand around like you know what this is what I am because it gives me a bunch of energy and like what is what is that not like you know and how do I just not have to do it maybe I don't have to do it at all I think sometimes I I operate from an old model with a new business where you know I grew up my dad's an entrepreneur from an Indian immigrant family like it was all about going to his office you know clocking in the morning clocking out like being there every day being present uh in front of your team and I think we're just in a new world where it's like is that do I need to operate like that as a creative as a Creator um I I found myself that another thing that Tim said was it was a quote from Whitney Cummings but he said if art imitates life then you have to have a life and I think that the the mentality of like I really want to succeed is hey I'm going to go to my office I'm going to grind every day I'm going to work really hard but then as a creative person or as someone who's on a podcast it's like well now I have very little experiences to talk about or you know it's kind of like I can tell you about the coffee shop down the street from here where I get coffee every day and then I come and sit here all day right I'm so routine yeah listen to this why does anyone want to listen to if I don't have interesting life experiences there's um uh a thing I realized which was my my grandfather uh like what does your grandfather do or one of your grandfathers like did they like have like a factory job or like any like yeah my grandfather that I knew because the other one uh passed before I was born um had a um like train engineering job in India yeah almost exactly the same like grandfather some engineering like a chemical plant right of some kind he worked there and like to him work was you come to the factory where the the ingredients are coming in they're getting processed there's fumes everywhere and like that's what work is and there's like a shift supervisor yeah and then if he saw what my dad did which was like go to work with a briefcase there's a computer on your desk you sit in a like kind of cubicle or desk like oh sorry office and you know you take phone calls or you get on a flight and go to a business meeting where you're gonna shake a hand and maybe do a paper contract deal like that was kind of my dad's job that's like what work became right it's just kind of unrecognizable and looks much less serious than the chemical plant or the the fertilizer Factory or whatever yeah um and then like to my dad what I do he's like are you ever gonna work like what are you doing you're sitting in front of your phone uh you know you're talking to who who's listening to this you get paid for this like well if I give a bunch of views then yes or like you know sometimes you know if that's like I'm I'm working it's like no you're just [ __ ] around on YouTube it's like right that's exactly what I do I like I'm looking for in the most interesting things in the world and I'm synthesizing and I'm gonna talk about it but it's like our version of work is unrest unrecognizable too like you know our parents and I'm like oh like I just have uh kids and I just have two two little kids I'm like whatever they're gonna do is probably gonna blow my mind it's gonna be so super unrecognizable it's super unrecognizable but every generation does that I'm like oh that's kind of interesting like I should kind of not write off those things that look like complete not work yeah um and like our company got bought by twitch which is like if you watch people playing video games for a living it's like what this has not work that was a very confusing era I mean even now at you know in my mid-30s when I look at what a 20 year old Creator is doing it's hard for me to track uh you know I I spend a lot of time on YouTube I spend a lot of time talking YouTube creators but this next wave of creators is kind of like wait what's happening what's going on um what's the name of that girl who's like going viral because she's like a NPC doll yeah baby doll yeah I was like that that's like yeah is that the thing I don't know is that what our kids are going to do they're gonna breaking machine all of this is so like uh it brings so much about like who are we as people like right what is that that we're into uh have you seen this thing it's really strange have you seen Pinkie doll basically she's she's just standing there and like people are donating using the tick tock live thing have you guys seen this yeah there it is so good thank you Jackie gang gang gang gang gang gang oh special gang gang gang gang gang gang balloon if they donate the cowboy she always says the same thing the same way like uh like she's a bot and she's just making like I don't know like whatever she's making like seven thousand dollars a day seven thousand dollars there's all these funny memes too of like uh guys filming their girlfriend like doing this I think it says a lot about what we crave as audiences obviously there's like a lot there to unpack of what we're into but um the interactivity like you think back to entertainment um even when we were growing up it was like the TV told you what was on it was a lean back experience right turn on TV if what you wanted wasn't on you just waited and you may not even know yeah you know you're super into these like Niche cooking shows right until the yeah until chopped comes out and you're like oh exactly I didn't know I wanted to watch other people cook but I don't know if you remember the TV Guide channel yeah it was a TV Guide channel you just waited told you what was on channel 12 and if you missed it you had to wait a whole nother 100 channels scrolled by so that was like a very lean back experience where we're like okay you tell us what's what to watch right um and then as we progressed there was like TiVo and it was more on demand it's like oh [ __ ] we can record a show and like have it on demand or see what's coming up um and now you accelerate it all the way to YouTube or Instagram and it's like I can search for what I want I can curate my own entertainment now it's I can create my own entertainment right right I can pay money and she will do something yes that's like in that's the next level right it's like interactive entertainment where I'm not consuming it I'm creating the entertainment I'm part of making part of it yeah yeah and I think that's what you know twitch I think is a great example of that too right like people people watching long live streams why it's because they can have an impact on it yeah I think people don't really even actually understand what's going on with twitch um like now I think it's accepted that twitch is a thing which took a while to be like is that like a big deal and it's like yeah it's actually a pretty big deal but I think unless you use twitch I think people still sort of think um the default is probably like uh twitch is people watching other people with Video Games Live and so maybe they're really good at the game it's like yeah that's part of it but then some people are you know like a lot of people are just there for the chat a lot of people are just using this background noise in another tab like I remember looking at some data when we were there about how many people are literally just that's not the focused tab on Chrome and some people were like well we should we should like discount that as like you talk to users like no that's like how I like to use twitch I'm not just yeah it's not like at an accident and it's just running in the background like I listen to it while I work and I'm coding and I'm listening to this and I'll check back in like every every time something interesting happening I'll go I hear the crowd War basically I go look at the score and I go see what's going on to me it's like the reinvention of the radio right twitch has right really operated like that but then again where you get to play a part in it Ludwig was another creator that we we talked to on the show where he has developed this kind of adversarial relationship with his chat yeah because the way you said it was interesting you go it's kind of boring if everybody's if this else is just supportive right yeah it's like you're right and I was like I never really thought of it that way um and he's not adversarial like they hate each other how would you describe it like what is what's an example of like what's going on on his channel it is so odd there's so many different things that go on I would say his sub-a-thons are probably the thing to to bring into Focus which is essentially you know he'll go live for he he initially started as 24 hours but um every time you uh subscribe every new subscriber he extended it right so essentially yeah it was an adversary right it was like I want this to end but when you take this action it extends right right it extends an hour so he ended up doing it for 30 days uh Straight live streaming to 30 days straight but again now but yeah it was fun while it lasted but that's an example of like having an adversary relationship which which is you know kind of like you can interact but you're bringing me discomfort right you know by by doing this um so it makes it fun for the audience to to play with that and it's obviously like a joking relationship yeah but there's something that's you know fun about that and I think we should really think about these audiences the young audiences that are growing up with this what do they want next right because we are we are thinking about like the advancements of of entertainment in the context of what we had and how advanced this is that we can self-publish on the internet right and that people can comment and we can have Discord servers and we can engage with them but there's there's a whole nother you know version of participation even think about Tick Tock like why do why did Tick Tock become such a big thing it's participation it's like it was easy to participate for anybody to make it yeah it's easy to and they told you what to do right here's the trend here's the dance here's the dance here's how you do it here's 100 videos of people doing it here's the sound you try click this you try it now right yeah so the the even you look at Pinkie doll right what we're just talking about for you to do that for you or I to start doing that it's we just start a live account that's it we just start like there's the participation is so easy um where we can either participate in the actual live stream or become that Creator within a matter of minutes right uh what do you think's next where do you see the putt going with that obviously hard to predict it's hard to predict but I think anyone could it might be you yeah but I think I think what we have to realize is that um Tick Tock taught us a lot about the fact that the platform is the creator uh in that context right like if you take the top 10 creators off of tick tock Tick Tock still Tick Tock right you still open it and you it's a For You page you wouldn't even notice it's almost reverting back to the lean back experience I opened Tick Tock and I say you tell me what's going on right back to what we were just talking about with TV it's just that it's personalized to every single person yeah so it's hyper personalized I think is number one right when we think about the trends that are that are coming which is already happening but I think also um like participation forward so it's like it's personalized but it's really easy for me to engage in the action too and I think that's where maybe there's like two extremes there's the the Mr Beast where it's like I can't do I can't buy a train and have it go into a ditch which is something he did in this last video and then the opposite end of the spectrum is like here's what's happening on YouTube shorts or or Tick Tock and actually really easy for me to do that and I can try it myself I'm in s I'm in San Francisco if you walk around SF you uh you know you can't like you know you you stub your toe it's like what did I step on oh AI it's like nothing is right the answer to everything is AI and I kind of wonder if the answer to this is also AI meaning you see that AI can draw amazing art I like a pink you know it can paint better than right you know a human can paint it can paint anything you want instantly whatever um it can write it can make you know chat GPT can make rap lyrics and so I wonder you know how do we just get to the point where actually the Creator is the algorithm is the creator it's just it's hyper personalized and here's just like it's gonna just deep fake and create something that it thinks you like and it's just gonna try 10 000 variations per second and then if anything starts to work it starts to like go more down that rabbit hole for for more creators yeah it might not even be a Creator it might just be self-generating video right that's what I mean yeah okay people seem to like because they have I mean an unreal amount of data right they're like people like to hear people eat that's like you and Sam been defect yet have you heard of my first million yeah I've heard of uh Audio Only not a video one but an audio only version that's a fake conversation and how how close I mean it's like like okay if somebody listened to if my family member who doesn't listen to the Pod listen to it they would just think this is the podcast yeah because it doesn't sound robotic right there's little moments but it's like kind of passable if you don't know what deep fakes are you'd be like I guess it just sounded like that if you listen to the Pod you'd be like oh you're cool but you're not really like substantively saying anything like did you hear the one where they did Joe Rogan talking to Steve Jobs yeah and that one was pretty good I think we kind of edited it well I know my cool demo I listened to Joe Rogan and Sam Altman is which is it's a YouTube channel called The Joe Rogan AI experience and I genius idea yeah it's a genius idea but I clicked on it to find out like Joe Rogan and Sam Altman um talking about open Ai and how Chachi PT Works Right started listening to it to be like what does this sound like I want to hear one and then I just was like wait this is just good and interesting and then I just found myself listening to it and then I was like do I care so if we can do that with the like V 0.1 then you just have to believe like okay inevitably that's where it goes there's been a few of these that go viral right like the kind of AI uh fake AI things like there's one on Twitch I don't know if you've seen the twitch one of Biden and Trump debating yes I think where we're gonna see this all really skyrocketed is during the election for sure yeah right and it's gonna get really weird crazy and weird um I brought it up about you because um it happened to me and Colin recently where it was a video of me Colin and Mr Beast talking about an online casino that he had started and it was also our lips were also right um and there's it on YouTube or no it's taken down we got it taken down um we got to take him down pretty fast but yeah it's cool [ __ ] that yeah it was really compelling but I mean it it was too compelling like people could click on it it's like to the to just the untrained eye it's like oh that could have been a moment from the podcast I didn't watch um I've had to have conversations with my parents about like hey careful be careful if someone calls you and you think it's me let's develop like a safe word basically um with all this like when you ask me what's next the thing that's been on my mind the most is physical experiences okay I actually think that we're gonna want things that are uniquely human um in the coming years I think we're going to want things that are like Collective human experiences where right like stand-up comedy I think we were going to want to sit and be like that human is standing there delivering that entertainment to me or plays in theater um I think we're gonna want that and I think there's a lot of digital creators who are building really promising communities where people will show up but a lot of online creators who are building High viewership but no one would actually show up to something that they do and I think that's and what's the difference I think the difference is um the amount of Personality that you inject into your videos and if people are willing to connect with that right like long-form podcasting is there's people who spend more time with you and Sam than they do talking to their own mom right or their their own best friend so they have this like really in-depth parasocial relationship you guys have done Live Events people come yeah right um and I think there's other creators who rip all of that out because they're looking at the algorithm and they're like you know what when I inject my personality right 10 of people stop watching but they're looking at it on a view of like five million people and they'd rather have five million views than 4.5 million views but when I look at it I'm like I think I'd rather have a hundred thousand views or a hundred thousand dedicated fans who are who walk away knowing something about it one more unit of trust who are who are down to listen to me talk and and understand my personality then try and rip all of that out to make sure they get to the end of the video and that is that is how like the business YouTube is is predicated on do they click and do they watch till the end but I think sometimes that can give you the wrong signals of what should I keep in what should I keep out right and again back to the conversation of high quality audience um and I think the young creators it's like it's like playing video games on YouTube right if I try this then this number goes up right right and I think that is too easy to manipulate right now um and there's there's so much information I think we're we're part of that of like sharing information on how that all works but you do have to take a step back and be like am I building a brand and a brand is about trust credibility depth of connection and that comes from some stuff that might not be optimized for the algorithm yeah there's um it's sort of like Drop Shipping versus like building an actual brand around what you do right like that's good there's um I don't know if you ever saw when Sony got hacked do you remember that one yeah there was one email that I remember came out that was like pretty interesting and I think it was um one of the early Sony guys talking to the CEO and he was or one of the it wasn't maybe the early Center guys maybe it was like one guy from like a like a music a record label talking to him and he was like you know here's what we're seeing and he's like basically the more popular this gets like you know people streaming music at home blah blah he's like it's also creating a pent-up demand for what he calls I think I think out of home entertainment's gonna be big and he's like out of home entertainment like uh he's like festivals will do well this was like a while back and like there was like this kind of like pretty big Music Festival craze that kind of came out of it um but there was also a couple other like trends like that like even things like Tough Mudder and Spartan Race all of a sudden people were like you know what I just want to like go and voluntarily crawl through mud this weekend right like why would somebody want to do that it's like yeah kind of because you're sitting in front of a computer all day yeah life got too easy and you kind of feel soft inside to go voluntarily have this like hardship but also you want to be able to Instagram it and put it online who that you did it yeah I think uh I totally agree with that and I mean obviously that that it that's what happened but I think AI is going to create like this homogeneous nature to content right everything's gonna feel the same aim and that is going to make us create something completely unique and different almost like looking for like AI has brought a lot of efficiencies into our studio um we use AI for a lot like what do you guys use autopod are you familiar with that no what are they okay so there's there's three cameras right now right and so basically you would bring these three cameras in and you want to get a Clarity on like if I'm talking the cameras on me if you're talking the cameras on you oh it does those cuts it just does those cuts automatically it's a three hour conversation it'll do it in 90 seconds oh that's amazing and it'll be very precise when you start talking it'll go there if you have a human here live switching which I don't know if someone's watching he's not live right now but we talked about it like right before we started I guess so if he's live switching with the switcher he actually can't predict when you're about to start talking right he's gonna be a second late so now I do I trust the human more or do I trust the AI more I mean the reality is it's brought a ton of efficiency into our office that's cool we also explore YouTube titles and play around with AI to be like hey here's the title we thought of but give us 10 variations right and sometimes maybe it's it's ours that we like right but if we keep going down that path you know the other day we were in this chat GPT or it's a different tool chat GPT but there's there's other like Creator specific AI tools there's some that aren't public um that can only be used if you're uh partnered with certain you know Creator companies specifically uh there's a company called spotter yeah that has a really great uh AI tool that I was using this morning and the funny thing is like you're sitting in a room with with your team and it's is it more efficient to sit alone with AI and get hundreds of variations or is it is it more efficient to sit together as a team for 30 minutes I don't know the answer to that but I think probably it's AI right um so the question for me is like if this if it's driving so much efficiency I think I'm gonna Crave inefficiency in other places and right it's like the slow food movement totally like from the table exactly fast food gets too present yeah it creates the demand the craving for the other for the inefficiencies yeah I've what I've seen though is that even though that gets created it does usually end up getting dwarfed by the thing that of course uh you know yeah better better faster cheaper you know like yeah style of stuff entertainment I think is different like you go to a concert it's the most inefficient way to hear the music right the Taylor Swift concert right you if you like Taylor Swift music and you just want to hear it just go on Spotify right you're one tap away so why do you want this collective experience why do you want to drive deal with parking get in there you know get to your seat it's kind of a pain in the ass to go to a concert right so what is it about that that's you know it's a it only happens once right it's like an experience that you get to happen but you know by the Numbers a lot more people will stream Taylor Swift and we'll go to that agree but you know she'll make a lot of money and monetize totally uh totally differently yeah tell me about um Mr B so I've gotten to go to his place and hang out with him a little bit pretty remarkable dude um and not like oh he's like an alien or whatever but just like very interesting to kind of see him in his like normal ways uh of working and you can kind of see some differences between how he approaches things like you know for me I was like oh how does he approach things how does he see situations and approach things differently than I do and he came on the Pod but it actually was like nothing he said on the Pod would have given me that Insight but actually watching him work and like kind of being in a brainstorm with him then you do start to see those differences I think you've gotten a lot of access to those moments yeah what's uh what stood out to you that you've kind of like picked up or noticed just by spending a little time with him I always say he's like the most unique human I have ever met uh I think he's like very very unique in what he cares about you know I think what he cares about is very different from you know what I care about or what a lot of people care about he's different what does he hear about he like is is so unique in the fact that he is laser focused in a way that I've never really experienced and and maybe at times like in in a way that I don't want to experience yeah yeah so he doesn't want to no I mean him and I have this conversation a lot like I I don't crave what he has um I like to have more of a wide perspective on life and a view of uh different types of experiences and he's very um committed to his craft and very like he he can laser focus in on something like if you've been in one of those brainstorms with him he's just like very blunt he's very you know he's just like why would we do that that doesn't make sense like no doesn't it doesn't exist in the same way for him that it exists for other people based on social context or based on like well I guess he said no doesn't exist for him yeah the same way it exists for other people I think that's really accurate yes I have a story of an example of that many stories the time where I saw the most was at the Mr Beast Burger opening in New Jersey at the American dream Mall Colin and I was insane right we spent the 24 hours with him before and after um and lived with him through this like what felt like a uh hurricane storm of fandom and new experiences for him and Reed and the whole team did you think it was going to be go to the part where where he walks out where he walks out dude that was so I was the only camera behind him at that moment is famous but I was like this is not what I thought was gonna no I mean there's multiple times where I had the chills filming this video um so I filmed I filmed that clip and then Jimmy was like that's crazy send me that and I sent it to him and then he tweeted it and it was just like it's completely insane um but so that experience There Was You know the night before there was a question around like how many burgers they could serve and and there's already I think you know 15 or 20 000 people there the night before right it was completely insane and uh they were sleeping in the Mall mall security was there and they were just like okay all right I guess no I don't think anyone fully understood uh how big he was at that moment um and so they were like okay we don't know if we can serve all these people and Jimmy was just like what what do you mean let's just figure it out like what do we need to do and they're like it's just not possible we can't get more supplies here and he was like well can can we pay for it can we just pay someone to do it and he was like well I don't you know I don't think so I don't think that's possible and basically what ended up happening was it was possible and Jimmy just kept pushing right at a point where again it's like a lot of people would be like okay that's a no if I ask three times yeah yeah there's no other Possible Oh the fire marshal said it yeah whatever yeah and I think he he thinks in different ways too of like um you know the his immediate thought was around the staff he was like I need the staff to be really into this I need them to be on it and so he's like I'm gonna pay everyone an extra thousand dollars today and that is thirty thousand there's 30 people working it was thirty thousand dollars and it's in our video where he says I'm gonna pay all of you guys an extra thousand dollars to whatever you're getting paid today right um that's like an irrational thing to do a lot of people would look at that and be like that's kind of irrational um to spend an additional thirty thousand dollars um but you know he looks at that and he was like this is what I need to make this excellent right we're just gonna do that you know and you look at what he tweets about now too he spends you know a million or two million dollars on a video and it makes 200 000 in AdSense revenue and you know obviously his sponsors and stuff but some of his videos don't make money and and he's just like but that's they're good right you know he he thinks in just different ways like that yeah just very unique I uh yeah I feel the same way he also um said some things so he also said some things that were like really funny to me like um he was like I was like so do you want to like have kids or like what's your like what do you want out of life beside okay yeah I've heard the YouTube part and I was like what else do you want I think he said he was like I want to be president I want to do this I want to be a billionaire and I was like okay cool but like what do I just like out of your life like forget the big cool sounding things like do you want to get married have kids like what do you want to do and he was like um he's like yeah you know I uh he's like yeah I'll I think I'll probably like you know date or get married or whatever he's like Isaac I wouldn't want kids no [ __ ] no I don't want kids and I was like oh why not he's like oh he's like actually you know like Steve and Elon they have kids there's probably something to it so I'll do it and I was like our first just hilarious to be like uh like yeah just like the first thing basically literally like the dead Steve Jobs you never met and be like he's just like that's that's the class of people I'm in yeah you know if those people did it might be something to it so I'll do it just kind of for that reason but I don't feel the need for that because I'm on this Mission and like you know that's where my head's at right now I have seen him you know just being friends with him and having conversations and we just did another podcast with him recently um I have seen him mature quite a bit like I think we we do have to remember like that's a guy in his mid-20s of course yeah you know actually he wasn't even I don't know how old he was I remember laughing at something and I was like dude he's so much smarter more mature than I was at 24 23 when it's just different though again it's it that's not I don't I didn't have any friends like him when I was in my early 20s I think he's he's a very rare individual and he's 25 now and he's maturing into he runs a company with uh over 100 plus employees he's got this like whole massive operation this massive platform and he's 25. it's it's uh gonna be interesting to watch the next five years if you were to advise him uh what would you tell him I think he's already experiencing some of this where he's looking at his content and injecting more storytelling into it which I think is really really smart and something that Colin and I've been talking to him about for a long time um you know it's the same thing I was saying earlier of I I think it's okay to to have a deeper connection with him and and with the with the content and with the contestants that he has on there um and he can sacrifice some of the you know hyper retention editing for that um I also you know a year ago probably would have told him he potentially is doing too many things uh and he's already you know refocused right he's he's really just focused on the main Channel and feastables and if you think about a year ago Beast Burger feastables uh main Channel reacts gaming right these are all different things he's doing right um plus 25 other right amazing opportunities yeah people who want to meet him and this is that right everything will tug your attention away and it's he's a he can be excellent in all of those things but as you as you grow up as you mature it's like what do you say yes to what do you say no to and when you're at that platform where you have any and every opportunity um how do you focus right it's it's hard well the way output is he can be excellent at any of those but probably not all of them yeah right yeah not at the same time right you could do anything you just can't do everything at the same time because as a Creator in a creator-led business you are the bottleneck for everything and I've spent time with him he is the bottleneck for everything right like he needs to be pulled into the room to to look at something he has uh you know say on on all that stuff and he also has the right you know mind for it he that's the reason that company's so big and why he's built such a big platform so where do you inject that is it across 20 projects or is it across two and um you know I think they've they've really refocused and focused on on every one of these platforms has like a guy at a certain time or a girl at a certain time that's like the one they're like you know you know whether it was like Casey neistat I like kind of they have these like epic arcs and they're the top of the mountain and then most of them either literally stop creating because they kind of they transition career they get burnt out whatever it is or they're still creating but they're just not like there's the new wave of new people doing new cool [ __ ] um he is kind of remarkable though so you know he may have a different path or trajectory than than most if you if I was to say all right make a prediction um five years from now what is like today if Mr Beast is like you know the number one YouTube Creator and like launching a couple of these businesses underneath like feastables whatnot five years from now do you think he's still the number one Creator on YouTube I think he's probably the number one online digital media company I don't know that you know I don't know what Creator is going to mean in that many years like I think he has the best pulse on on online storytelling right now and I think you know we saw some people try this like the buzzfeeds the you know like these these massive media companies that emerge I think he's more akin to a media company than he is a Creator um so I I that's what I think I think he'll be the biggest media company um the way he's building is like a true company it's a great vibe there if you've been there you know like it's uh they have good people involved so I don't know I don't know you know what the content looks like I don't know what he as the Creator looks like but I think it will be a a media company like when we sat with him last in our last interview he has a ton of aspirations to make content for Netflix he has a ton of aspirations to produce stuff and you know I don't think he's that Keen or intent on he has to be in everything or he has to be the lead in everything right I think that's been the that is the draw right now but I think in the future it Mr Beast is a Content Studio you know it could be we could be be looking at like we don't know if we're not looking at the next Disney or Paramount or you know some massive Studio that can build IP and monetize it in different ways like Mr Beast is the first if we look at it and say that's the first show that was built out of there right it's a game show that has a couple different formats it's distributed it's the biggest show right they built a chocolate brand out of that that operates kind of like a game show you can win stuff when you buy the chocolate right so it's like okay that looks and feels really similar to like a Disney and a Mickey Mouse right okay let's let's build this big media platform let's build a product connected to it there they have that skill set they probably replicate that right and as you look at their cast of characters you know there is a cast of characters there that can be built out um there is more IP that can be built out it's like build IP connect product to it right you know our connect experiences to it it could be an experience too yeah if he chooses to uh to go that path uh I want to talk about this this is amazing yeah so your con your content company did something pretty dope uh you guys did I think what is 100 editions we had 500 of those no no but this was to celebrate it was to celebrate two years of our newsletter two yeah two years in the newsletter the published for us yeah so you got this newsletter the published press uh which is dope it's like you know what you guys do on the YouTube channel so like Creator a great newsletter for creators I mean it was largely inspired by like the morning Brew hustle movement right which was like okay we are subscribers to these newsletters what if we made one about our own Community yeah and then uh then you made actual physical newspaper yeah I'm very honored because you yeah pretty much sold out of these yeah um this was dope why do something like this because I I I'm asking because this isn't like an economic move this isn't this is not gonna grow your audience it's not going to get you rich yeah it's not going to do any of those things it takes effort yeah um it's a risk in a little in a way um what's your philosophy on just do dope [ __ ] like this why uh it just it's fulfilling like I it's it's hard to say that we have a hard-nosed philosophy on it it's just like we are creative people and as we've built a business like one of one of the things that's so interesting about being a creative is you're really good at kind of zero to one and the like let's just do cool [ __ ] until something works what becomes startling is when something works and then you're like okay so what now I just keep doing this doing this uh and that's like that's the really funny thing about Colin and I always say that creatives aren't consistent people right um and so we've surrounded ourselves with really consistent people who help us be consistent in the formats that we found um but you need that occasional pop of just like you know it'd be cool to make a newspaper right like we we were rebranding the publish for us that's a new logo for it we just we're like how do we how do we tell people that we've been doing this for two years how do we celebrate it also was we had just crossed a hundred thousand subscribers on the newsletter and it was like how do we celebrate this moment right what is it do we just put out a tweet that's like hey it's been great um and we were like well as things are getting more increasingly more digital what if we did something physical and that was it that was the impetus and then it was just hey is everyone excited about this okay cool are we down to stay up late at night for this great and that's it just organically happens when you're there's a lot of people who we asked about this and they were like that's you know we that's not going to happen in the time period that we wanted to happen in and then that's another exciting thing for a creative person that's another exciting thing um so yeah I would say that it it's again like it cost us money uh we did not make money from this there's no sponsor in it or anything um it it didn't you know dramatically grow our audience but um it it has been a moment where a lot of people could understand what the brand was and a lot of big creators reached out to say can I have one yeah you know I want one in my house and then we're seeing that creators have framed it and put it in their house seeing that there's just something yeah you dm'd us and asked for one and like that to me is like again back to this concept of high quality audience it's like the people who reached out about this it's a premium and the real mask is because it's like in retrospect once you see the final product in school and then you hear these stories and it's like yeah all these things make sense it's hindsight it's up front when it's kind of unknown kind of unproven tight deadline you know a lot of things to do that's when it's hard to do this or or sometimes you say yes to too many of these things right so it's almost like sure what you just said kind of reminds me of like Google had like the 20 time yeah all right hire the best engineers in the world and like this guy is fixing the bug in the AdSense platform but like we got to give these guys like 20 time to just tinker and hack on yeah stuff that that they you know get motivation from and like uh logically you'd say well you're losing you know 20 time is basically one day one day out of out of the week that they're not working on on this on their main job but the reality is that like sometimes those hit and also it makes the other four days out of the week yeah more productive like you don't actually lose anything totally because you attract the best people and you gave them an outlet to like be creative and also if you're not following what's exciting you then you're just you built yourself a job right and that's like then you have to look at it and be like wait what did I just do you know what what did I just do um I also think that you know what we do with our merchandise and what we do with anything physical like most of it at the moment is not driving crazy Revenue right it's not like a revenue driver for us but we think about building our community and we're very Niche and so for Niche creators we think about Collectibles like we want to create Collective right yeah um and when we have Collectibles then you get to be a part of our community and be like I'm it's the feeling of going to see a band when you were younger and keeping the ticket stop it's like I was a part of this community at this moment right so these are Collectibles along the way of of our journey you think about the the massive creators like Logan Paul and Mr Beast or Emma Chamberlain they're creating consumables which is great for Mass creators right so um these these things are like cool Collectibles that we think are cool like we're planning another drop in in October and our merchandise does not you know uh drive like crazy amounts of revenue for us it's relatively nominal but it's awesome when you walk down the street and see someone in the merch which sold you know 2 000 of these hats and they're they're out in the world and right 2 000 people are wearing them and we've we see stories where people connect because they saw someone else wearing the merge so that to me is like the symbol of community building this tight-knit group uh who can connect and be like I'm part of the same group as you identify in the same world as you do totally we uh that I love the way you put it it's a great frame on that idea of consumables versus Collectibles when we uh we're about to launch like merch for the Pod or whatever and it was like oh yeah merch and it's like okay here's two things I know number one people don't want to wear or like for us it was like they're not gonna wear a shirt that says my first million like this is not gonna happen it's not cool I don't want to wear that bait I want to wear that let's just all agree on that what they will wear is like inside jokes and slang that only you if you know you know and if you don't you don't no small stuff yeah no small boy stuff or like I have this shirt that it's a we made that's a Polaroid of it's like a fuzzy Polaroid of Sam when he had his hot dog stand it's like in the style of those like Kanye shirt or whatever it's like some like cool cool looking like it's like an imitation of that right and it's like nobody will even know who that is or what you can't even tell that it's a hot dog stand but like if you know you know and that's and that's it and I was like we should just do I was like in front my rule is like the Tim Ferriss rule is basically if you're not gonna make a ton of money on it it should be free or it should be like as just sell it at Cost but like and do like a limited run so that it's more interesting totally and just only like if you're gonna try to make money only make money when you're gonna make a lot of money don't try to like trickle a little bit of beg for money everywhere because that doesn't like nobody likes that and that's not the right approach for someone like this and a lot of our Merchants also the right way to think about it a lot of our merch shipments are driven by a referral program through the newsletter right right so that's like you know again that's like pulling from the The Playbook yeah the the whole the newsletter Playbook you had this um tweet or this video that I saw that was like a naval quote that I really liked it was um it said like uh was it was like your problem is that you're writing to be read yes that resonated with you and me I want to like talk about that why did that hit because so simple it's like you know yeah seven words or something I think it hit me at a time where I felt like we were creating very scared the beginning of this year I felt like we were creating very scared like we had crossed a million subscribers last year we felt like we had built a brand in the space and opened up the year we made a few videos that we just canned we just didn't put them out because we were like oh those aren't going to work for the audience but we liked them um and got really in our heads around you know again you're playing this dance as a creator of what you want to make what the audience wants to watch and what the platform wants right those are the three things that we think you're you're constantly playing with and if you overvalue what the audience wants you will you're you're catering to you know this group that obviously they have created your career if you know you've made it um but you you can't forget that it came from what you wanted to make I think on on one side of the spectrum of you know being a publisher or being a Creator there is the artist who's like I do not care what you think I'm going to make this and that has financial implications right that are essentially very hard to make money like that but very cool we respect artists like that right um there's some most respected artists like are misunderstood maybe understood once they pass or just didn't care about what the audience thought right uh your interpretation doesn't matter to them right then you go on like love that you exist but like sure I like guac on my Chipotle I'm gonna have a job it's okay the other side of the spectrum is being a distributor it's like why do we have so many Spider-Man movies because they put butts in seats right so the person at the studio the movie studio is not an artist they're thinking about what do we make what are we green light Spider-Man that's going to get people in the seats that's going to sell tickets and I think as a Creator you have to be in the middle of that and some creators slide heavy on the the side of distributor of just like what does the audience want to watch I'll make that whatever you know and then on the other side of what do I want to make um and so I think that Naval quote really hit me in this feeling of losing you know I did grow up I went to film school I you know took playwriting in college I'm like really into artsy stuff and I think when money gets involved when you start commercializing your creativity um and when it doesn't work for years that's an important part of our story right it didn't work for a long time we didn't make any money for a long time you get terrified of losing it and when you get terrified of losing it you start creating to be watched or writing to be read would you say creating scared yeah creating scared yeah let's take a book title right there I like that one yeah it's something Colin and I talk about a lot it's like let's not create scared you know what are we scared of you know like again it's it's all this mix of the public view count the perception the tweets of like these guys have fallen off or whatever you think is going to happen if you put out a video that people don't like um and people can feel that I think I think you can feel it as a Creator it feels really uncomfortable to to create scared and right um yeah it's not it's not fun to watch yeah absolutely you know um you had Husson he's very much on the artist side I think uh he like drew a line in the sand for himself he's like Okay I uh either I'm gonna get on Tick Tock and I'm gonna dance for the algorithm yeah or I'm going to go the other way and I'm not and he's like had like the soul searching moment it's not like you know he he sent me a voice memo once I was just like bro I'm gonna just create great art I'm an artist and an artist creates art that's what I'm doing I'm not a businessman first I'm not a Creator first I'm this is what I'm gonna do and he's like so I gotta be true to that and I'm gonna work on projects that are like interesting to me from that perspective and it's got to hit my bar on that and like that's the vibe I got from him but you know this was a few years ago when I yeah when we were talking about that stuff you had them on I think more recently yeah um end of last year did he say anything that kind of resonated with you on that totally yeah I mean he talked a lot about he kind of changed my whole perception on making YouTube shorts I guess he what did he say he kind of made he kind of made fun of it uh you know husband's like so funny the way he he talks but he he described making YouTube shorts as being a skinned rat for the engineers in San Bruno which I thought was really funny uh he was just like you're a guinea pig you are um you know essentially creating more data points for them for their you know you're you're they're your boss um you know whatever works on their algorithm you then Pander to that right and so he he kind of pushed Us in that that direction of recognizing like are we artists or are we creating for the algorithm um and the second thing he said which I I heavily resonate with he's like everything is about the PDF which means like what is the idea right write it on a piece of paper is the idea good show it to someone pitch it to someone do they immediately go that's a good idea do they laugh do they feel some sort of emotion before it's before it's made yeah yeah and he's like people even when we got on our pre-call with him he was like all right what are we making together when we sit down right and he asked us that question and I was like oh you're right what is the Hassan Minaj calling and Samir interview let's write it out let's let's not plan it but what is it like what's the idea why is this a good idea to do this right uh what was the answer we talked about like how can we um like how can we bring forward his creator story of starting on YouTube and using YouTube to um go through kind of this crazy windy path up to Netflix right and how he's now kind of left YouTube um you used to upload he came up with shows and and put them on YouTube if you go to his channel and search by oldest like I like sketch shows sketch shows he did hosted shows where he talked about the news like almost like Tosh uh yeah that for us was like no one's no one has told that story that's interesting let's talk about that and let's talk about your relationship with with and he was almost like 18 19 doing like comedy clubs right like he's doing stand-up and like yeah San Francisco or something like that totally yeah I watched him uh do King's Jester live uh like we went out to go did you go to one of his shows that was really good so that's a stand-up special um that guy's like a performer man like he he re he really inspired me to be like this isn't like a comedy show yeah it's a one-man show it's a performance uh and that to me it really inspired both Colin and I to be like this is a craft you have to work on it you know performing is part of this Craft um ideation is the biggest part of it you know he has a writing partner that he sits did you meet Fred or yeah what's he like I've never gotten to meet him um but I'm very I'm very very fascinated by kind of the the wingman yeah like there's a library there's a lot of popular popular people but almost all of them are not nobody's solo everyone's got some kind of a team and usually they have like their their Confidant the person who's in the bunker with them figuring things out compliments them does all the [ __ ] they're not good at um but like kind of like keeps them going in the right direction and those people are actually really really fascinating to me and nobody really like ask them a ton of questions I have a million questions for them uh what tell me a little bit about him I think oftentimes as as creatives and creators we think we're we want to hire an employee but actually what we want is a collaborator yeah and if you're lucky enough to come up with a collaborator then you know those are the people in my opinion who typically make it like fully make it when they have a collaborator so Pratt a limited time with him but um I find comedians to be like astute observers of the world and uh I found Pratt to be like very much that right like he he had a notebook and Pen during the king's gesture taping it was a I don't know if it was a taping or if it was just one of the shows but they were prepping for the Netflix special yeah and he was sitting there during the entire show he was sitting right in front of me just ferociously taking notes on what was working what the audience was reacting to when there was too too much of a pause when there wasn't like he was um and right after the show before Hudson came back into the Green Room him and Pratt were talking I love that yeah I love it when it's sort of like all right we're going back to the lab lab yeah it's like we kind of like we do our thing but like because I tell so Ben's my collaborator basically so like we did a couple businesses together but also when it comes to content like we recently did um we're kind of new to YouTube but we did we used to just basically put the podcast on YouTube yeah I remember and that was like you guys are growing now though I started really bad it was like we were the first time we didn't remember we had like 4 000 views and I was just like oh man like but like which is fine for when you start but we already had the podcast was significant so it's like it's kind of like if you play poker at one stakes and then you go down to the micro Stakes like you know quarters in the 10 cent table doesn't feel very fun because you've now experienced a different uh level of stakes but those aren't even in the same Casino yeah Spotify or apple pods on YouTube yeah it's a completely different group of people so exactly so so we were like all right we think we could do this and so we started grow but recently we did one and it's this uh it says money one that's on the right there that has how many views I have now nice so 300 000 views and this was a video it was the first video that I made YouTube first I was like okay I'm gonna uh create a video that I think is gonna be like YouTube it's not just a podcast and me and Ben were like what if we just took three days it's like we just tried to make one great video for this and we did and we made that and we were basically collaborating on that for the first time we had done that that way but the cool thing is now we've been working together for a couple years and you get this like mine meld where it's like yeah it's almost like uh you only could you could speak in shorthand or reference like it's like if you say something I already know what part he's gonna be like oh we gotta talk about that later right because that relates to these other three things and then earlier we talked about this but that's and it's like if you can get to that point that's like a pretty like formidable thing that I think most people don't have but when you have it it's like oh [ __ ] this is that lets you go places I think you need someone who's excited and wants to to be a part of a team where their name isn't at the Forefront right which which can be really complex right but we know who Pratt is but if you're a fan of Hassan scale you're not going to know who he is uh so you have to find someone who's really into that too right who likes especially every person if you've ever tried to hire a lot of people like I want to work for you because I want to be you because I want to be you yeah and it's like okay cool but that doesn't really work like especially with this group that's what I need yeah yeah this group right now it's hard to hire someone who doesn't want to be the Creator or you know is is trying to be become a Creator and working with you to be like okay now I get it now I'm gonna go right do it um but yeah you have to find someone who's Who's down for that but it's it is kind of like being an athlete where you know you guys when I leave you're gonna talk about the performance right you're gonna you're gonna probably watch game tape back you're gonna watch it back and be like oh maybe I should have asked this question there or maybe this would have been more interesting or he went a little long here I should have stopped him you know like there's so much uh that goes into this that if you deeply care about the craft and you have someone who cares that much about the craft you can get better at the craft be a better faster give me a better way faster yeah it's hard to find right it typically happens just organically and then you're like okay this is my guy now right how much do you guys so you guys have your business off the back of your thing which is the news the newsletter's a yeah kind of a different type of business it's actually a separate company and there's separate people writing that thing it's not you guys creating it necessarily have you seen and uh I'm I'm keeping track of these kind of Creator driven businesses where you have like almost like a an audience co-founder and like the way you used to have like a technical co-founder for a business now you have one like a distribution co-founder or an audience that's cool what have you seen that maybe everybody hasn't heard of right because I think everybody's kind of heard of Mr Beast and maybe a couple others but um what are some cool ones that you're keeping an eye on or I should know about or other people should know about the typical Creator business is make content sell ads right which is like that's that's Baseline some people never need to grow out of that because that's just a good business um but like when when you go through those extensions like I think Ali abdall has a fantastic education business uh he's a Creator out of the UK who talks about productivity and um he's built a series of courses and wasn't he a doctor too he was a doctor prior yeah you're right he's a doctor he's an excellent teacher but he has built a great business um that is you know very much focused on online education I think he publishes his number he publishes his number is like four million a year on his like four or five million on his pushing to six this year Creator Academy yeah which is like basically become a YouTuber yes yeah s and he has a ton of courses on skillshare about like studying for the MCAT or like he's just figured out that okay I'm really good at making online video yes one of those ways is to monetize through advertising but another one is through pages your online videos and that's the classic like build one sell twice right it's like you build it it lives on skillshare or on your own website for years to come people can buy it right so I I really like the digital product business um because it's just scalable and we do very few things that are scalable as creators right um I also think there's a um there's a future model now which is potentially there's a a Creator named Amelia de moldenberg who has a show called chicken chop date um it's a great show are you the one who showed me yeah it's a great show she she's had Jack Harlow on it she just had Jennifer Lawrence on it said what's this what's the stick it's like out of chicken shop like it's a date yeah it's a date at a fried chicken place in London and the chicken shop in London is like the last place you would go right to have a date so there's comedy in it she's a comedian um and through yeah through this so she's had like this has now spun her into essentially creating her own production company where Brands come to her and say we love your shtick we love your comedy we love the way you've created this show um like this show has no advertising in it no advertisers and will never have advertisers and this thing does you know the Jack Harlow episode has 15 million views um this regularly does you know one to five million views in the first week but no advertisers and what it operates as is like it's a production company and Nike just came to her so she kind of created an agency she created an agency yeah so like Nike came to her approved like I can create cool likable content it's vertically integrated where she can come up with the idea then her company can shoot the idea then she can be the talent in the idea and then the thing that I think we forget is like she's the distribution outlet for that idea too where did she post on her own on her own YouTube channel yeah so she she doesn't do ads but she'll put like full episodes she went and hosted the Barbie Premiere um that's smart so I like that there's another um Creator named Amanda rashley who's who's uh based in Canada and what she did is she started YouTube by showing bullet journaling and how she was setting up her bullet journals and what is it so go to the channel Amanda r-a-c-h and then Lee uh and now yeah like go to like one of these bullet Journal setups this just looks like Etsy of YouTube yeah yeah and how many views does it have three million so when she started she was doing these bullet Journal setups like here's how I set up my journal and then what she did was swap out the journal she was using and create her own custom Journal company and that to me is like epitome of Creator business right where it's what Colin and I call content product fit she didn't have to change the content right to integrate the product yeah right you just I mean to talk about a big example it's Chamberlain coffee when Emma Chamberlain launched that she drank coffee in every episode right swap her coffee product placement but yeah done at like a whole nother level yeah yeah and I think you know it's something we're actually struggling with with our uh newsletter um which is like our version of that how do we integrate that in every episode sure we can bring it up but that doesn't drive subscribers right um so it's it's Logan Paul said this about prime he said a lot of creators when they talk about their own product it sounds like they're doing a brand deal yeah they don't know how to integrate it regularly you know and like the milk boys with happy Dad right their alcohol is in every single episode right because there's still no presenters yeah yeah um Logan has Prime everywhere with him um so you know I think creators who have this like Amanda they can build really substantial business content product fit yeah content product fit um so this is a really impressive business to me because it's just it's niche but three million people watch this and she sells this journal yeah that's insane yeah she's got to be doing I mean what do you think she's making on something like this I I've spent time with her she's never told me but I will say that she speaks at a lot of Shopify events that's like a a very good case study for them uh I know she's doing well she has a good team um the thing I love about this business too it's it's repeat purchases there's a new Journal drop you can run out of pages in a journal once you know once you have allegiance to this it's like yeah you know great uh so I I've had this idea for because I'm a big Journal guy yeah and so uh I was like oh dude I want to create my own because I don't know I like I have an idea of what I want mine to be I just haven't made it so if I'm gonna make it for myself maybe I'll make your brothers but the best uh example my favorite example of this is actually a really small Stakes one which is the Ryan holiday coin totally that's like such a good example of this because he was like he's the way he described it so first it was like the content uh product fit where he's just like stoicism here's the like reminder coin that like you're gonna die you know whatever you remember you're gonna die whatever but he was like you know I've done like t-shirts t-shirts suck yeah and he's like I wanted something that was like I could fit in an envelope a normal envelope so like mailing was easy I wanted something I can manufacture here so I don't have to like produce overseas whatever he's like no sizes no colors it's like just like they're so good yeah like there's one skew and I'm gonna sell and I think he sold like 20 million dollars of this one snow over there really yeah I'm pretty sure I think I'm pretty sure he's out on our episode or we like I think probably one of the biggest creator-led companies um right now that that maybe isn't as as prominent in the mainstream conversation is Mark rober's crunch Labs which is like a subscription subscription box stem or something right like he's like yeah exactly it's a science kit I got it for my nephews it is excellent they are hooked on it nice like it is excellent I text Mark about I'm like dude this product is crazy like it's huge that's your big business huge yeah that's a big business um yeah yeah and I know he said now that that makes more than his channel yeah I mean his channel is massive that's that's another rating because he does basically crazy science experiments right a threat yeah and he has big versions of that in his videos so like he'll make a big version of it right and then he'll be like and you can make a miniature version of this at home I think this content model this what you're just describing here these examples is um like I always think about when I meet someone I'm like wow you had so much success like what'd you do and they're often the story is basically like you know there was like a moment in time where like if you realized like X like X thing works which is like in the early days of Google it would be like I could buy clicks for a cent for like any keyword like that's insane like okay let me just work backwards what's the best keyword and like so that's how I got into like selling leads to lawyers or whatever like you know asbestos you know removal company or whatever and then it's like um like our buddy created native deodorant and he's like yeah basically like I started this when Facebook ads were kind of like underused and people were only using them for like like media companies were trying to buy Facebook ads but then they were like driving them back to a blog post and monetizing with a Google ad there right right it's not really a good model yeah I realized like you can sell just like a product through Facebook ads with really simple ads and you don't want like things that you used to have to go into Target get Target to carry you you could just start selling directly to Consumer through Facebook d2c I mean like there wasn't really like as much of a category yet but it's like if you knew if you knew that secret during that time it was kind of an Open Secret but not like it wasn't obvious to everybody yet yeah I mean I think movement watch is another great influencers online marketing but I think what's incredibly hard especially for creators right now is what you have to sacrifice to have that that view and that long-term view of building a product because um advertising revenue is so available right now to us and again you you kind of pull the levers when it comes to YouTube It's the highest margin advertising dollars that I think you know has did in video content ever right because you don't get on the phone with the advertiser you aren't you aren't negotiating a contract there's no sales team there's no back and forth there's no revision yeah but YouTube takes what like 45 yeah but still it's like you know dude you just don't see it you don't see it it's just like and like you don't do any work you don't have to do any work you don't do it right you just you upload content you get a check in the mail um so creators who make really viral content that has reasonably high cpms it's like I should you know I should make another video and then a brand deal comes and that can be you know anywhere from from twenty fifty thousand dollars all the way up to 200 000 right you're like well okay all right I'll make another one of those videos and then what I find is that a lot of creators never get to that moment of okay now we should stop and put our focus in right over here and how do we even do that it's a totally different skill set yeah how do I even do that how do I hire someone I think that's the biggest need in the Creator economy right now is operators are the biggest need yes and education on how to hire is so it's just not there right because they were it's all young people who who is funny by the way because there's so many operators because I'm coming to an operator yeah yeah and all the operators like dude I could if I just had the right influence or this is a soap we could sell a lot of this soap right or whatever the thing is you know pick your favorite widget and uh and for them it's like a total black box like how do I go meet these people get them to trust me enough to do this and so it's like this this and then also have the temperament to to want that right like a lot of creators have to they might conceptually think they want it but then when they get into it and their name is on a soap product right and they don't really like that it went out to a customer and it wasn't perfect and then they're like oh I don't want to do this every Friday they freak out they freak out right because it's like I have so much control over how my brand shows up um that when you start to scale that it gets uncomfortable right so and do you um I have this question up here I put on this list three creators likely to become a billionaire I give you the one for EB you can say Jimmy and uh he could be one yeah what other creators do you think have the potential to build a billion dollar Empire around what they're doing it's a combination of their content plus businesses whatever I think Dude Perfect um I saw they did like a amusement park or something like well they're working on it yeah yeah 100 million dollar project yes yes what does that mean that's what they're investing into this project I don't know the specifics of it I've spent a lot they're actually I've known them for a really long time like I you know I've been on YouTube and around YouTube for 12 years they were the first group that I got involved with um early on when when we sold our last company um and they're kind of like the trick shots will do it yeah they worked but they make Sports accessible to you know young kids through trick shots and and um you know viral sports videos and the the reason I bring it up is like I think those guys have been at this now since around 2006 or seven right and they have remained at the top of their game throughout that whole experience they also went through a long period of time where you know they've done the work like I watched them hold the cameras for years even when they were at 30 million subscribers they would just go out themselves right hold the cameras and edit the videos and they still sit there in in the edit bays and make sure they're perfect and um I think they if you if you've seen images of they just did a tour see images of like the fans young kids who turn out for that the parents um I had a conversation with them one time where they said their goal is to be the the most trusted brand in entertainment and I actually believe that they are they're on track for that where parents really trust that they can take their kids to a Dude Perfect event right and that when you take that to an amusement park when you take that a couple steps forward I think that matters a lot in the future um and I think they're they're on track for sure that makes sense that makes sense I like that pick uh anyone else come to mind that you think has the potential to to do something large like that I think uh I I think of some creators who have the potential but I don't know if they want to do it you know like I I think Cody Coe is actually someone who's uh he's coming here tomorrow oh he is yeah I love Cody I know you went on his show yeah I think Cody is like one of the most intelligent people I've met uh in the space I think he he even as he's like in starting to invest now and I can just I was thinking about it because him and I were texting yesterday and I was thinking in my head I was like who's Cody Co in 10 years he's either like in the woods you know like yeah man DJing and running or he's like running the biggest Capital company you know like and I think that's just a personal choice up to him it's all available to him um but yeah I I don't know that uh I'm sure there's others that I'm not thinking of but they're my favorite brand on YouTube TMG TMG is my I agree on your favorite Channel on YouTube I think Noel Miller's like a true artist special and special like I think there's very rare people like him and also very not very many people like Cody Co right um so yeah music videos are so goddamn good it's actually kind of it's kind of frustrating yeah it's like a bit it's a bit off-putting like dude what like you can't just do that right at that you can do it as a joke it can't also be amazing it'll be good yeah it can't also be good it can't also make me want to listen to it multiple times right yeah funny and amazing Annie you just did it like for kicks on the side right on top of your other successful thing I find this like Pursuit of being a billionaire to be very fascinating like I I I don't really have interest in it if it if it's the outcome of what I decide to do that would be interesting but it's not like I don't find myself to be um focused on that outcome and I also found most creators I talk to are not focused on that outcome totally um but I think it's in the video game of Entrepreneurship it is the final boss right so you're kind of like if your final boss is actually walking away sure yeah the person who says they have enough is is like like uh you know Paul Graham who created YC which is I think probably the most successful Tech startup actually because it created sure all these other Tech startups and like I created Dropbox and it created Airbnb like they probably wouldn't like to say created but like they without them there is no Reddit there is no there are there probably aren't those those businesses being successful including open AI because right he saw Sam Altman and made him president when there was tons of other more qualified candidates on paper but he's like this even says something he's like this is like what it would be like to talk to a young Bill Gates like saw that before and now he's created open AI which is yeah today the most you know one of the most valuable private startups so anyways YC uh gets to the peak of its powers or gets like you know does amazing amazing stuff 10 years in and Paul's like Sam here you go I'm going to the woods in the UK and I'm gonna live in the woods with my family and I'm gonna basically like write essays paint and code and like you know that's what I'm gonna do and that is the final boss of Silicon Valley because you see most people just go right back into the hamster wheel and they start running again but that's like the final boss of life right it's like making that realization is not wanting anymore yeah yeah being like content and and developing a relationship with the term enough yeah that's that's a hard thing to do but totally do you have that do you have a number or like a do you feel like you have enough like what are you in pursuit of um I'm in pursuit of a really specific thing which is um I Heard a quote once that I think Naval said he goes uh the the day you stop trading today for a better tomorrow you've retired so he's like um basically if the things you do today in and of themselves were the reward of what you did today you've now you've actually exited the game you've retired retirement doesn't mean you go sit down and do nothing it means you're not saying all right I'm gonna do this [ __ ] today that I don't really want to do I don't like to do but I'm doing it because it's gonna pay off in the future it's gonna pay off in the future like your whole life goes by doing that yeah and so when I heard that I was like oh you know guilty like you know put me in put me in cuffs take me to jail like totally that's me I'm I've spent the first you know 15 years of my career like you know from 20 to 35 basically was that I was like oh I'm gonna do X and I'm gonna say I didn't enjoy it necessarily but like definitely I was like doing X because it might lead to why I totally agree I've never just done access that too yeah I've never just made my main thing like I'm doing X because I'm just doing X seems fun yeah and so that's the that's the game I'm playing now is to try to achieve that um to craft my life such that that's true and so um even though it's like weird it's like you know it's awesome it's like what I like to do best I don't know I like to I like to do this podcast I like to read I like to talk and I like to like yeah uh you know work on these little Tinker with these little things or you know just understand go down rabbit holes and just see how things work in the world and it's like those are the things that I do without thinking about some like future payoff because I don't think they even like or they don't clearly have one well you can also have the there's another Tim Ferriss uh moment in our in our episode together he was like something to the tune of like you can decouple the um the non-financial reward and the financial reward right right so like this experience um there's a non-financial reward to this which is like we have a good conversation right cool this is fun we both go home that reward is complete then you put it out if there's a performance reward to it amazing if that leads to financial opportunity great you know like but that's a separate reward and if you can decouple those things then that is uh yeah and just basically uh like the way I think about stuff is like there's a car and uh you can have a bunch of passengers in the car it's like you know I have like my ego but hopefully it's in the trunk it shouldn't be driving like you know let's put them in the back you know yeah yeah he's kind of annoying but he's there and you got like you know the thrill of things that's in the car but I don't really want thrill to drive because he takes us off the cliff like who gets to drive and so uh you know that's kind of like so to me I'm like all right who gets to drive is like the version of me that is uh following my curiosity creating [ __ ] consistent like just creating things yeah and is content with life and has like a I'm doing it because I want to do it I'm doing it because it's enjoyable to do I'm doing it because it's challenging so even if it's not that enjoyable like I'm struggling at it I'm enjoying the struggle of doing this thing yeah and so that's who I want to drive meaning that's who gets to ultimately make the decision of where are we going in this car other people might have input other the other parts of me might have input like I want money I want this I want that yeah but I can't like like basically money was driving for a long ass time and then it's like hold on wait the deal was you get to drive till we get to this number we got to that number you don't get to drive anymore yeah and maybe you shouldn't have been driving for the first place but at least in my life I was like I want to get to basically a Financial Freedom number a number where I can spend whatever I want in my lifestyle and it's coming off of my investment income not out of like my work income yeah uh because then it's like all right cool money works for money I work for me man I think that is a big opportunity with uh creators it'd be like a smaller group but I think as creators we're really good at generating money but we don't know how to turn money into money right because we're it's like it's a totally different it's a totally different skill set and then we don't know who to trust with that you know I think if there was a Creator focused group that helped with that that well we went to this athlete thing yesterday with a bunch of there's a bunch of basketball players there and it's the same thing like literally we were joking we were like this event would be cool if it was just the athletes who do what they do and us but then you have all the clingers yeah and you're like who do I trust and then like yeah and like and some of the clingers are the people they trust and they're like kind of safe choices they don't actually know how to do the thing for them sure it's like you know actually if they asked I would for free help them or tell them exactly what they should be doing so that their money works for money and they don't they piss it away yeah but um the incentive is not for me to go chase them and reach them and then beg them to listen to my advice yeah the guy who's trying to take their money is incentivized sure to chase them and beg them and and try to convince them that they're the guy who's gonna help them right it's like this weird like perverse incentive it's like the guy who's gonna like work his hardest to break into your circle is the one who wants something yeah you actually don't want to work with someone who's like needs something to you yeah yeah on the sports topic there's one more um destroying uh he is a sports Creator a football focused career he he played football at uh UCF and this is pre-nil days right so he played football he was making YouTube videos they brought him into a room and said you have a choice you can either continue playing football or you can continue with your YouTube channel he chose YouTube um and built this this really substantial YouTube channel he has this series called one-on-ones uh that just go live to places like he goes to like the city yeah this is like Live Events and they get crazy like in Arizona it had to get called off because it was like too many people there and the police had to get involved uh I was gonna go he but I think he he messaged or his management somebody messaged okay okay I mean yeah like he's an hour away I was like oh that sounds kind of fun but it's like I didn't make it out what does he do so it's one on one so basically it's wide receivers versus cornerbacks and that line up and they go a one-on-one and one dude wins ten thousand dollars and for some of the communities he's going into that's life-changing right right for a lot of communities he's the guy in the thing or it's he's the two other guys I think he's the host um you know and like here you can see like this is this is what it looks like um if you go to his channel and go to most viewed so cool so that so that guy if that guy had caught it he would have he would have ten grants it's a tournament and you and then you start to know these characters and they travel to different markets this is the new and one mixtape exactly this is Android mixtape for football and um Colin and I spoke with uh at a YouTube event with Dee and he was speaking with Roger Goodell and we were talking to Roger about destroying and he was like this guy's like really impactful for football oh wow he's creating new fans and the NFL just partnered with him on this series The one-on-one series and I think when I look at D like the leagues are starting to get involved with him in a way where I'm like wait he is single-handedly a really uh important part of the future of sports viewership yeah and that to me I don't know that he I don't know if he has aspirations to be a billionaire but to solve that problem for the NFL is a uh big problem to solve and if you solve that for the CFL and you start solving that you know you go down the line this can also become camps totally can become you know so many things right the world is his oyster he can become a host he he's probably should be one of the hosts uh for the NFL like or like the Pro Bowl which no one's watching I think he can also create a uh yeah I mean he can redefine the Pro Bowl because this is more interesting way more yeah I'm like half looking at you because you're watching this I mean we pulled this up in our office and we have a ton of people who don't watch sports and then they got hooked on it they were like this is Primal it's a primal yeah and so he could redefine the pro ball he can also create a nil agency right so you have college athletes who he represents this you know where College athletics didn't let you monetize he knows how to do this right so okay now can D create a nil agency where he's signing athletes and getting them contracts he the world of D like the World of Sports no one is really approaching it like him and I think that like sports is still highs or carries a very high dollar value live sports yeah um it carries such high uh dollar value that I think he has that opportunity as well there was a guy at that event we were at that was um you'll know him because he's lacrosse Paul Ray ball yeah yeah he's a groomsmen in my wedding he's one of my best friends amazing he is I don't know much about this boardroom event yeah yeah so tell me about it so basically he what he was saying on stage was like okay we created this professional lacrosse league yeah what was interesting he was like there's like whatever I don't know eight teams or something but he's like We Own the teams yeah it's not like a franchise model and I think he's like we pay the costs but then like all the players have upside and the thing like what is the business model of this this sounded pretty fascinating and yeah so I think it's a good model also I'm an investor so a biased opinion yes but I've uh you know what I've always seen in in Lacrosse if you pull up um go to the premier Lacrosse League YouTube channel and and play the last Vlog from their All-Star Game you get a sense for like the community that one the fastest shot uh right that yeah so you get a sense for like what it looks like I mean they're they were going wild but like they they packed the stadium out in Louisville for their All-Star game so basically what he did was there was a pre-existing League called Major League lacrosse they paid their players terribly uh they treated them no that was the best league that was the only pro league it was like and no one really cared about it I mean like it was It was kind of interesting but it was empty stadiums they didn't have health care it was like they weren't treated like it was tough to be a pro athlete and not get paid much right and Paul became the you know number one uh lacrosse play area the biggest media platform Colin and I actually ran his YouTube channel that's how we became very close um we were running a lot of different athlete YouTube channels at one point and so we became really close to Paul that's how we met um and he had the best head on his shoulder for like media how do you build a brand how do you you know he had the biggest he was called lacrosse's first million dollar man he had deals with Red Bull and New Balance and um he had created the model for like how do you make money and was he was he the best and he was the best at Media or he was actually the best at media and really good no he's he's the he was the best he was the best player he's the best player yeah yeah so those are those like Conor McGregor at one time he's the champ yeah and yeah he's like the most marketable guy so he he decided uh you know at one point just to say hey you know what we're gonna go raise money and create our own League like this league sucks that I plan um that's what he did he turned to Joe Tai who's uh the Nets owner yeah Nets owner uh who played lacrosse in college and loves lacrosse right and he's a great dude met him a couple times and uh he became the lead investor and then they partnered with with rain group and um they raised a bunch of money and said we're going to pay the players a reasonable salary or give them equity in the league we're gonna give them Health Care uh and we are going to create media around them we're going to create media opportunities for them we're going to teach them how to you know and the last thing they did was they said we're not going to stick these teams in local markets we're going to actually take the whole league on tour makes sense so they they develop that makes more sense it's like a touring you know circus where it's like is it coming to San Diego this weekend okay everyone descends about this major major Market yeah you know if you have lacrosse people they come to town twice a year exactly we'll go to that we may not go all the time or there may not be enough people to support a stadium well I think also what he knew and what what we saw was that the model in Lacrosse well you made money was by doing camps and Clinics right so you you you have youth camps right like there's a lot of young kids who want to play they come from affluent backgrounds their parents are willing to pay a thousand dollars for them to get coached by their favorite lacrosse player um and Paul built a massive camps business and so alongside this you go to a major market now you have a weekend dedicated to you can have camps you can turn all these players into okay Camp counselors and and trainers earn extra money or whatever they can build their own bespoke businesses but that all you know connect to the league and that's um so he him and his brother are really sharp and they didn't sell franchises yet not yet yeah and they uh bar stools involved in one of them okay uh they they got to name the expansion team and uh pardon my take like they're the owners uh the water dogs that's like the ridiculous name yeah but like that you know there's that creates a kind of that that inside joke with the part of PMT community that it's like they have their own team it's like collab because when they play Big Cats tweeting about about it uh when they they won the championship last year he got his own ring you know it's like amazing they're able to build again they're very media Savvy and so they they understand that this is a long game lacrosse is not well to build any League I think it texted you this during the event I was like I think what this guy's saying is actually quite smart we should look at investing and I go I'll go man building a league is hard like fun if you do it easy that is like one of the hardest games you could play in the world of Entrepreneurship is creating a sports League from scratch because it's like kind of a 20-year Arc to actually get that you have to have such a long view on the world and on your life to do it and you're doing Live Events you're doing all the hardest things I mean every weekend he's in a different city you know I'm watching these and and looking the most promising thing is look how young the kids are who are there right right so if they grow up with this league these teams these franchises like they are playing a very long game here um and I credit them to for doing it but it's uh it's not an easy thing they sign like a 10 million dollar deal or something with ESPN like ESPN yeah yeah so when they first started Colin and I made a documentary about them for NBC uh that's right we've had like many different lives of you know Colin and Samir but yeah that's amazing do you think that's going to be uh you know good investment for you where you like the first one in because he's like your buddy I was first one in uh which was great so it's doing good yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah it's doing that right now like um like you're gonna get like you're gonna let's say this works out hopefully like you know like we we all we're rooting for this like you're gonna make a bunch of money from this thing that was so impossible to predict that that's how this whole thing would pay off right mom I know yeah yeah I don't have health insurance I don't have a job I know I'm kind of filming this like failing League this is like lacrosse thing it's like and it leads to the thing right so it's a Steve Jobs I mean look back you see all the dots how they connected but like when you go even further back like and the way this happened was my first idea when I was 21 was to set up a laptop and make YouTube videos about lacrosse commentating right like that was a bad idea when you really you know you zoom out but if you're into it like a lot of creators ask me like how long does it take to make it on YouTube like how long does it take to make it I'm sure entrepreneurs ask that question too right or have that thought in their head like how long is this gonna take um and I was like I always think it's such a ridiculous question because I'm like well what's your relationship to making videos do you wake up every morning and you can't not do it like you're just like all I can do is make videos then you made it then yeah you made it and it will there will be an outcome from that there will be it will lead you somewhere um but if you wake up and you're like this sucks it's kind of what you were saying it's like I'm doing X so I can get to Y well the entrepreneurship version is um startups fail but Founders don't so like I moved to San Francisco in 2012 so that's 10 years ago and I met a bunch of people and we used to have like these like underground founder like meetings or like training tips and tricks and being like yo what do I do this person I need to fire them what do I say when I fire them like basically there's a bunch of CEOs being like I can't like tell my team about this I can't tell my customers about this I can't tell my investors about this I can only tell you guys yeah because you guys understand and look unlike YouTube everybody who was doing Stars design was like all living in the same seven mile radius City and so we would just all meet up all the time and sure enough like as you watch if you tracked that cohort it's basically only two outcomes one is got so burnt out from like the grind and failure that they just stopped after like you know three four years uh more than five years they just like did that company they're like screw this I'm taking a job I'm moving back to Connecticut and like I'm gonna live in a low-cost place I'm gonna de-stress and I'm gonna do that but everybody else who stayed in the game won like literally like almost like a hundred percent of my friends who stayed in the game yeah and some of them won in year two someone in year five someone in year nine now we're in like you're 11 or 12. people are winning like now but like and it's kind of like it feels like a really long time like wow 12 years it's like yeah but we all started this when we were 21 so like you know yeah um okay we're mid 30s yeah because we're 34 and Rich like you know yeah it worked in the end it worked right the 15-year Arc you get like a then the odds flip from like 90 of new businesses failed to actually like 90 of you guys will succeed if you actually enjoy this enough where you'll keep doing this even though you have easier options yes I always I've said that multiple times um whenever I'm having something that feels like I'm struggling I'm like this is the uh uh the least rational path to making money right is what I do that I at this point also now I have enough exposure and enough of an abundance in my network that I can go and get it get a good job right but like I do this because it's it's just what I do it's just who I am I don't even know what to do in another context I don't know what that looks like I I will say though like being it's hard to be uh not outcome oriented you know like I think as an entrepreneur you'd think about like exits and you think about you know like these big paydays and uh I would say that even with with our newsletter like when I saw milk road I was like okay I want that outcome too but whenever I get too attached to that outcome I'm like okay wait a second right that that's like that's creating in a way that's just like the product probably will not be great if I don't just put my head down and go okay it's Mondays this Monday issue really great okay it's Wednesday so this Wednesday issue really great and I've really tried to um refine my focus on process and impact like is I I have to focus on the process of creating the thing and then the second thing is like my a lot of my reward is seeing if we're having impact is is this actually impactful what I'm putting out right or is it just going out and you know no one's saying anything about it or we're not getting any like I I find I gauge the success of our stuff from like the texts I get or the DMS or like hey that episode is really impactful or hey that really changed the way I think about this or hey that newsletter taught me about this if I see those that I'm like okay we're doing we're doing something um let's keep doing that and hopefully that takes us to an outcome but you also have to accept it might not it might just be this and we might just get you know five percent better you know over the next two years right and that's it and you have to accept that that is a that is the maybe the most likely reality is that you just keep doing it right and as long as you can accept that it's for me that's how I I you know explore it for myself yeah the best test of a project is basically would we regret doing it if it didn't work right like obviously we don't want it not to work and we might be upset if it didn't work but like would we actually regret doing it if it didn't work because then it's like oh I'm just actually dependent on the success or failure of what's usually a low odds of success Endeavor totally whereas other things you're like oh really regret it because I well I'm still gonna get this like still gonna be fun to do still gonna learn a ton I'm like this is the type of thing I like to do yeah so you know if this doesn't work out it doesn't really matter like I'm just gonna ping pong to the kind of the next version of this but it was a forward it was a forward step either way right like there's this uh uh like Tony Robbins does this thing where he does this um dabblers versus Masters I don't know if you've ever heard this so he tells a story at his events where he goes um he goes uh there's some people that they go and they discover racquetball which maybe now pickleball would be the shirt but it's like you know they go they go to the gym they're like they see somebody playing racquetball they're like oh try it they go and they have they have some fun and they're like racquetball this might be my thing and they're like okay I'm gonna play racquetball and so they the next day they come back play again next day they actually go and they uh you know they get better shoes because they're like oh that was the problem last time they buy the racket they start playing blah blah blah and they they're doing well but then they play somebody who's been playing for like 10 years who's like way better than them and that's you know for three days straight they're playing and they can't hit a good shot everything's going off and they're losing all these games and they're like this stupid like stupid racquetball like right I mean this box I'm trapped like you know this is it's too loud in here it is weird this is a sport for old people you start to find all these Reasons to Quit so they they quit like I'm gonna play real game I'm gonna go play uh tennis so go outside you play tennis you're like oh so much better on my doors this is way better and you know you're hitting the ball around they're starting to learn The Strokes they're enjoying learning a little bit same thing happens they start to play somebody who knows what's going on they're hitting the ball in the net they can't really serve well that's it's getting frustrating it's hot out and they're like stupid game like you know what is this this is this is like a girly game I don't want to play it I want to play like a real game Golf and they're like just [ __ ] and he's basically like you know most people go through their whole life doing a series of these dabbling and they're dabblers and he's like what's the difference between a mast there's like there's three categories a dabbler a dabbler is basically like try it as soon as it gets hard bounce then he's like then there's the stressor achiever stressor Achievers like when it gets hard they just start gritting their teeth and they just gonna keep going but they don't enjoy any of it and like all the hardship stresses them out but they've just been trained since they're a little kid to like push through it just keep pushing through and like you'll get a gold star later like the The Joy will be later he's like then there's the master the master is basically like they like they know that when you start something new there's the initial like Joy of Discovery there's the learning curve there's the hard plateaus and when the plateau comes they greet it like an old friend like oh there you are like I thought you'd be showing up soon I've been right I've been playing for a week and usually that's when I'll hit that's when you arrive plateau and I know how to like deal with you because I know that after the plateau comes the next uprise and I'm excited for that upswing but yeah let me work through this Plateau they don't really get like flustered by it so they get the same or they get better results than all three way better than the dabbler significantly better than the stressor achiever but the difference is like the whole way they're kind of actually like enjoying the dance or playing the game yeah because they actually understand that this is like these are all normal for the game and you find that like the people who um get really like into like struggling or grinding or like get really overwhelmed by like you know the adversity it's really just like you haven't played the game enough to know that this is no this is how the levels of the game work yeah you shouldn't be surprised that the roller coaster is going up and down like yeah you remember you got on the you got in line to get on a roller coaster right that's a good point you know one thing that uh I don't know why this made me think of it I think just because like the ups and downs of the game and the conversation we were having at the beginning of the show about interviewing one thing that both Colin and I did was go to improv class to learn how to be to get better yeah just to get better at like being present working with whatever the other person says like what we found was my wife was listening to our interviews and she was like you're not listening to them you're just not listening to your guests they're saying something and then you say something completely different you're just waiting you're just waiting to talk and so I went to improv class and it was really this incredible uh lesson in the craft of how do you sit in the pocket and just be like I can't have any preconceived notions as to where this is about to go right you're going to say something and I have to let go of where I want it to go right I found myself in the first day of improv I was like we were playing this game and I was like okay I know exactly how to make this funny this is going to be funny I know where to take it and the person right before me said something and I was like why the hell would you say that and then I had to deal with it and then I was like oh this is the work right this is the craft or building the craft and I think you know in in in the the roller coaster of being a podcaster like you have to be willing to do all of that in public as well right right like you you go back and you watch your early episodes that roller coaster is there's a record of the roller coaster of like times where it was going really well times where it wasn't going well times reviews were up times where views were down it's like all public and I think um it's it's challenging because we have to practice in public I think that's like as as you build in public as an entrepreneur but if something incredibly just you're like naked as a content creator out there everyone can see everything so well you guys are doing an amazing job I'm a fan thank you I look forward to kind of seeing if this is your kind of like learning phase then like you know I'm excited to see what it's like as you guys Master this so appreciate it thanks for uh thanks for doing this I really appreciate it thank you so much [Music] foreign

Floyd and Conor are probably the two smartest businessmen ever that come through Combat Sports and they kind of knew okay this is the right dance partner and then it actually happened early days would be shot down by UFC and I think that the banter is really what allowed it to happen because once they started going back and forth and you could actually see the level of Engagement and interest from a market perspective it was hard to deny it and ultimately it was a huge success I mean over 4 million buys what was reported I think was 30 to Connor and 100 to Floyd was that what was reported Connor was just under a hundred Floyd's side it's very reasonable to think that he could have pulled in a hundred

this may not be the best acquisition ever but I'll be damned if it isn't up there yeah right like I think that he bought this I don't know that I don't know the exact number but he bought majority of only fans for I think single digit millions of dollars maybe low double digits possibly low doubles but let's even say it was 10 million dollars this is now a more than 10 billion dollar company [Music] I want to start the episode with a survey for The Listener huh and we'll actually let John and um Ben chime in so just Ben turn their camera on so I could see her face all right so we're gonna start with the survey so on Monday morning at 7 30 a.m I wake up from a text from Sean and here's what the text says it goes hey you got good topics for tomorrow I just texted Emmett from twitch to do a pod and he said he'll do it tomorrow so I'm gonna drive to San Francisco tomorrow and record an interview with him and so what I want Jonathan and Ben turn your cameras on what I want you to do a

this would I say do you have good topics for the Pod tomorrow if we weren't gonna do a pod with good topics together I don't know seems like that might be something that uh you know that we're gonna do all right well I just want to see what the audience thinks so whatever um I have a bunch of topics today what do you have I got bro you think you've got a bunch of topics I got however many topics you have add one that's how many topics I got well I see a big list you have like an interesting you have a few interesting things what you you want to kick us off with something let's start with this yeah so um we've talked a lot about one business on this podcast probably more than any other podcast has talked about this business I would say we are the champions of this company we are the ones out here letting people know that this company is legit that this company is Big this company is very interesting everybody's overlooking it we've been saying it for years we've been a pain customer of this company I'm not a paying customer because I'm a married man but well you can be a married man do you appreciate a customer but like I've never paid I'm not a paying customer because free porn exists and I'm talking about only fans the uh so only fans is annual numbers leaked and um not leaked actually what happened was actually kind of interesting you know this but maybe a lot of people who are listening don't which is that any company uh that is based in the UK has whether it's private or public has to report at the end of the year a sort of a financial summary and the more the bigger your company is the more data you have to include basically like a like a public company you have to report like like a public company so in the US if it's public you can go look up their information maybe the quarterly quarterly earnings or you can go find their S1 but if it's a private company you're just out of luck you're just guessing but if you go to onlyfans.com and you scroll down to the privacy policy click privacy policy you will see that only fans is run by a company called Phoenix International Limited and what is Phoenix International Limited it is a company based in the UK so if you go to the uh there's a a entity called company's house and Company's house is where uh all of the company information is housed and so if you go there you can find uh you can look up Phoenix International Limited and then you can look at filing history and you can see that there are several reports so reports about uh this director replacing this director but the what do you want to what do you care about is the one that basically says here is um the 2022 Financial summary year-end Financial summary and when you go to that you're going to see the following picture of a business only fans is a business that generated or collected 5.6 billion in Revenue in 2022. its take on that it was 20 so their their company took 1.1 billion so for every four dollars a Creator makes they make one dollar um on that 1.1 billion in net revenue 525 million of profit so this company is spitting off half a billion a year of profit pay a little tax the after tax profit is still 400 million dollars and then the beauty of it is if you scroll down to uh to the I don't know the balance sheet uh somewhere down right out right after the p l it says dividends and it shows that the owner Leo took 338 million in dividends last year oh my God and a year before that he took like 200 something million this guy is taking out 550 million dollars of dividends in the last two years off this business which is just incredible because let me let me remind you this is a company that he bought in 2018 this is five years what did he uh what did he he bought it do you know what he paid for non-public information but he bought 75 of the business at the time for what I believe was low millions of dollars was he wealthy uh before that yes so Leo is a um a kind of a gangster of the internet and he by the way if you just go to his website his website's awesome so there's really two things he's a listener I think well that's one of the things I love about the website if you go to his website which is just his name Leo Leo radvinsky.com um if you go to things I like so he's got things I like and then the very first category podcast very first one of two podcasts is my first million so he's a listener of the pot which was you know just a cool thing fun fun thing to see but I love his website because I love when people sort of put up their flag and they're like yo this is what I'm all about and it's just they just make it really easy for you to just understand here's who I am here's what I do here's what I'm into and if I'm into this if you're into those same sort of things we'll probably get along so his his main thing says he's a software company architect angel investor and open source software support this guy gives millions of dollars a year to open source projects that probably would have died had he not done that um he's a huge supporter of Open Source software and sort of like a uh he's like you know like a sort of uh Freedom entrepreneur right he wants projects that are increasing the overall amount of freedom in the universe so whether it's uh he'll fund these open source social networks that are like um like a mastodon type of type of social network that are are not owned or controlled by like Mark Zuckerberg or Elon Musk like one private company closed Source owned by a mega billionaire he's funds projects that are alternatives to those and listen to those also if you go to his so you see like he has sections about me projects open source things I like if you click projects only fans isn't even number one of the listed projects it's number two number and he it just says like one paragraph and it says what it is but number one is some open source project that's what he has listed yeah before X he's like uh b4x is like tools for rapid prototyping and development you know Microsoft discontinued visual Basics and before X stepped in to try to make this happen probably would have died you know basically like when I looked into this it probably would have died and then 2019 he decided to um put a ton of money into it just so this project could stay alive and um so then like under giving he's like yeah I don't I've done it a bunch of my time effort money to cost as I care about um including open source initiatives and traditional Charities my goal one day is to sign the giving pledge to sign the giving pledge you need a billion dollar net worth I'm pretty sure he has like a multi-billion dollar net worth now I think he's achieved this goal because in the five years and you can go look at the company filings but like 2019 2018 the company has like he pulls out like 1.5 million in dividends and so in like a three-year period he went from pulling out 1.5 million in dividends 250 and then 340 million dollars in dividends out of this company so this accelerated extremely quickly and I think like you know there's all these Great Tech Acquisitions there's like uh you know Google buying YouTube for a billion dollars probably worth 50 billion now Facebook buying Instagram for a billion dollars probably worth 100 billion now this may not be the best acquisition ever but I'll be damned if it isn't up there yeah right like I think that he bought this I don't know that I don't know the exact number but he bought majority of only fans for I think single digit millions of dollars maybe low double digits possibly low doubles but let's even say it was 10 million dollars this is now a more than 10 billion dollar company so he turned let's just pretend it was 10 million dollars into essentially 10 billion dollars of value personally not a fund not a company this is him this is one guy who owns the other 25 and is there a story of him buying this and like what he saw because like I would have if if this was me five years ago I would have been like dude this would never this will never work right I mean everyone would have said that so it was already kind of it was already working in a very small scale so this guy guy Stokely was the founder uh and if you go look at guy Stokely he looks like an Instagram model um he's like hey uh like every picture of him he's flanked by seven women and uh the story is the that guy Stokely his dad's on the finance world he takes a small loan of like 10 000 pounds from his dad starts only fans and um they kind of co-owned the business or whatever it's like a father and son was like sort of the origin of this good bonding yeah yeah some guys like golf some guys like fishing some Fathers and Sons start on the face yeah like right like that's that's amazing and um I don't know why he sold or when he sold but um uh yeah uh Leo approaches them and they buy and he buys the business at the time it was reported that he bought uh 75 of the business I don't know if later he bought the rest I suspect he did because there's one of these filings that guy Stokely has removed as a director in the company so uh maybe he just voluntary step down I don't know at some point you're just reading a bunch into these statements you can't say for sure exactly how it happened and this whole thing was very secretive in fact when I first found out about Leo owning only fans at the time nobody knew who owned only fans it was not clear there's nothing on the internet um this was several years ago and I was trying to figure it out couldn't figure it out and then I get a message from somebody who's who's like hey I know the guy who owns only fans and he loves the pot I was like whoa that's cool like I've been trying to find who owns this thing I wanted to invest in this and um anyways that's how we kind of like we ended up having a chat uh you know I want to meet this guy someday he's got a really interesting story so now there's like a photo of him on the internet and there's he's a very private guy but now a little more information has come out about him very early on I think when he was a teenager like 15 16 years old he got into the business of first I think like domaining so he would basically buy and sell like hundreds of domains like maybe thousands of domains in fact there's like a some he got sued at some point someone there's like a court filing of like here's a thousand domains that this guy still owns and it's just like every variation of uh like you know sort of like websites that you can imagine many of which were sort of in the adult category and then he creates my free cams and my free cams basically took over the cam girl market and um I think that site still makes great you know that's how I think he got very very rich was off that site um and he used that money then to invest and to Parlay that into other other businesses but he owns a portfolio of these businesses and now Phoenix International which is only fans has become a major major one this is amazing in a lot of different ways one it's amazing that company's house it's always a weird name I hate saying that it's companies plural companies house it's amazing that that exists and it's one of my favorite places to do research um it's amazing how fast this grew would you would you invest in this company or do you not do like yeah I tried to several times you know the problem is they didn't need any investment they were making so much money and so I was like uh hey um I can add value and I was like I don't even you know am I really you're crushing it what am I going to do here right like hey I'm a fan I think I'm a good hang can I invest that's really ultimately what my pitch was it's like I'm a fan of what you're doing um unlike most people I don't just like you know at the time when I was saying this stuff like oh you guys had a it's over time become more and more mainstream over time become more and more accepted as a thing that's legitimate at the time it was seen as very um very sketchy it was sort of the butt of the joke and um yeah so I definitely would have invested in this um I wanted to they were doing so well that I don't think they ultimately needed to needed any investment now the one thing they do need is liquidity uh like you know he's taking massive dividends which is great but like you know they could realize a several billion dollar liquidity event if they could go public or if they could sell but there's no buyer and it's hard to go public with a business like this and so I think you know I don't know what they're going to do with it but uh you know it's not a bad plan B to just suck out hundreds of millions of dividends every year it's fine yeah I was gonna say is that what he wants I don't know why you'd ever want to go public with it I don't know if he wants that but you always want the option right like any business person will want the option whether you take it or not is secondary in fact most of the things in my life I'm pushing for and people are like do you want this and I'm like oh I haven't even gotten there yet all I want is the option and if I have the option I'll then I can things what I definitely know is I don't not want the option right and I think that's just a better way to operate as a business person is to uh to make sure you have the options on the table for you yeah 400 million dollars a year in a dividend there's probably only five or ten I would imagine people getting have who have in the world or at least in America who have higher income like I remember Steve Schwartzman from Blackstone one year made a billion dollars and then the other guy is like what's the guy's name is it Griffith or Griffin the uh like it's usually just like Pam Griffin it's usually like the top five or ten hedge fund managers who make this and they're actually if they're the best they're it's Fairly reliable but they're like those are the guys who are buying the 100 million dollar apartments in New York you know like the bill ackmans and there's probably only 10 of them maybe 20 but like that income you'd be the highest in America in the top 30 or something like that you know what I mean so like I don't really I don't know man I would probably still own that um well this is cool well I've I've one thing that's cool about this guy by the way when I talk to him um like you know 80 90 of our conversation was not about only fans at all it was about these different open source projects he's interested in he was just he's very like he's a technical guy he's very curious very interested so he was showing me like oh by the way check this out I'm gonna send you this link you know like try this uh try this side out it's kind of like it's like this Fringe Niche site open source project but like I think it's really cool for these reasons and um I just love that I love you know one of the things I love the most about tech is that it redistributed wealth to a bunch of people who had different interests so like when the wealthiest people were all from Finance you just got this like one homogeneous pool of rich people it's like there's a bunch of Rich dudes that live in the same place like the same stuff white guys wearing suits Alpha New York um you know power suit watch wearing art buying greed is good come on guys yeah and then like crypto made a whole bunch of other people Rich right because it was like you know a different type of person got rich through that and they had different interests they're like yo I'm gonna spend money on this digital squiggle and this board ape and I'm gonna donate to this other thing and I'm gonna fund these types of projects and these types of this type of world view I'm gonna fund and you know tech companies were started by you know like Mark Zuckerberg and you know this guy didn't he wouldn't want to start a hedge fund he wanted to do something else and because he does that now he could spend his money doing other things or Elon Musk he's like I'm gonna fund companies that will do space travel when no investor would fund this I'll fund it myself and so I love when wealth gets distributed to new pockets of people who have different interests different values because they're going to bring some new like it's not the thing they created it's actually all the stuff they do with their money that creates 100 new new things that's kind of interesting to me I've uh I've emailed back and forth with them just a few times I've asked me to come on um I think you have two I don't know if that will ever happen yeah he's like I'm a pretty private person I don't think he's like I don't think I would make a very good guess but um you know well okay fine we'll talk about your dividends then sir you either come on as a guest or we find you on company's house that's the rules of this podcast dude let me tell you about another person that is hard to find information on and is really fascinating but really evil have you ever heard of the Sackler family I saw that there's a documentary or a movie out on Netflix about the marsh show but I don't know anything about them so I'm in the perfect spot I'm interested and aware but completely ignorant so there's two documentaries one on who or uh they're both actually fictional shows they're both really good one called I think dope sick one called painkiller one's on Hulu one's on Netflix the story is about Purdue Pharma so Purdue Pharma is basically I want to I'll tell you a little bit about that and then I want to tell you about the early even before that because that's more interesting to me at the at this point but basically Purdue Pharma started by Three Brothers they it was Mortimer Raymond and Arthur Sackler uh they were in yeah they were in the uh can you be named Mortimer and not be evil like that's I mean he's and he's one of the evil ones and so basically these three brothers I'll talk about their background uh in a second but basically they were in the medical industry forever uh since they're starting as doctors and then they worked at psych hospitals where they did lobotomies and they're like all right let's create let's start making these medicines and drugs and so after 50 years of doing this they eventually start or buy Purdue Pharma they buy it for not a lot of money um but they it evolves over 40 years to where they create this drug called Oxycontin Oxycontin was basically uh it's an opioid and it wasn't popular at the time it was kind of unknown they had a drug previously that was similar they kind of changed it and they the big change they did was they called it a Time released technology I guess so uh and they through a lot of just Shady practices it seems like they've bribed the FDA they hired lots of ex-fda people after they approved the drug and they promised them all this stuff they got the FDA to approve Oxycontin and the big thing was that they called it time release and they said that it was believed that and that word believe is important it's the first time the FDA ever said that it's believed that less than one percent of people who takes Oxycontin will ever get addicted so what they do is they go and hire literally 2 000 sales people who go to all of these hospitals these doctors these clinics and they say hey look we have this new drug it's for a moderate pain it's you can use to prescribe Vicodin only if someone had surgery and had major pain or if they're dying from cancer we have this new drug very few people get addicted to it and has a Time release capsule which means that it's really hard to get addicted to so you could give this to people if they just have like a sore back or if they have headaches like it's not that big of a deal and they train these sales people and they're very aggressive about training they hold contests where you can win a trip to Bermuda if you sell a certain amount of drugs you can do all these types of things where they would give like watches they would throw parties with hot girls like they did all this stuff but it was for medicine particularly in opioid which is incredibly controversial in my opinion very unethical and so they make Oxycontin popular to the point where the company is privately owned it's owned by two families uh each the Mortimer and Raymond's family uh I believe Raymond's son Richard become Richard Sackler becomes CEO and they grow this company to be doing like 30 billion dollars a year in revenue and they're also famous because in order to help their reputation they donate billions or hundreds of millions maybe billions that added up to two art museums and so the met in New York they have a Sackler wing like the the Louvre in Paris they have a Sackler Wings they these guys never went to Harvard but there was like in the Harvard school or the Harvard Museum that's for the sacklers there's the Columbia there's the NYU like they've donated so much of their money to arts and it's basically what they call it a reputation laundering so they try to like get like into High Society even though they're selling this drug turns out two years ago I think the government finally cracked down on them made him go bankrupt and I'm not sure where they are now but they're very private so that's the story of Purdue Pharma the the book Empire Payne's really wait so sorry that the end was the government cracks down on them and it goes bankrupt so the government did what because isn't oxy still like everywhere well so what's I I'm I don't know much about these types of drugs but there's Oxycontin that's like the brand name and then there's oxycodone and I think that's the generic drug and then there's hydrocodone and then there's there's all these forms of opioids I think you could still get Oxycontin but basically at first the government made them pay a 10 million settlement and then people spent five years trying to track them down and like find like one thing that I did that broke the law because it was very weird because they weren't actually breaking the law or if they were it was very hard to find which law they are breaking because the FDA kind of colluded and allowed them to get away with a lot of stuff so technically they kind of weren't breaking the law they got hauled up in front of Congress and what the government eventually does is they're like oh you lied to Congress because you said you didn't know it was addicting but we found this email from four years ago where you did say you knew it was addicting and so that's actually what they got charged with sort of like how Al Capone got charged with uh tax evasion not killing people it was sort of one of those things and that led to a domino effect where eventually they had to pay something like an eight billion dollar settlement the Sackler family had to give up control of the company and they were no longer allowed to be involved in uh this industry and so that's kind of where we are today where Purdue Pharma uh it still exists but not as it did before but we'll see if there's any actually long lasting change with all that but it's a it's a really fun story like in the sense of it's thrilling uh in that they were just horribly unethical they did a lot of crazy does that make sense yeah I mean this basically killed hundreds of thousands of people right like just through addiction it killed hundreds of thousands it killed hundreds of thousand people directly in that hundreds of thousands of people just taking that medicine were killed but then what it led to is what we experienced in San Francisco and all these other places you take oxy and then you're like I love this I need more of it now I need something cheaper and something more accessible heroin and then which leads to Fentanyl and so it creates this huge opioid crisis where Purdue was like hey we didn't do that we just prescribed Oxycontin these guys are dying from heroin when everyone's like man it's such a clear like there's such a clear transition here like you guys are definitely responsible so that's why it's like a thrilling story at Harvard there's still this this building is still called the Sackler or whatever the Sackler Museum or whatever it's called Uh still up which is kind of crazy that they haven't sort of canceled the the name off the building so here's where things get interesting and this is what I want to talk about so I mentioned there was three brothers only two brothers owned Purdue so the eldest brother his name was Arthur he died in I think uh the late 80s or mid 80s and basically he was the eldest brother and he got them all into the industry when he died his estate sold his portion of Purdue to the other brothers and the other brothers are the ones who Purdue eventually created Oxycontin and so Arthur's heirs are like look we had nothing to do with this uh it's the same name but like we had nothing to do with this and Arthur was the one who liked to donate a lot of money to museums so same last name but their argument is that it's different people but Arthur was incredibly shady and I want to tell you his background this is where things get really interesting so check this out so this guy Arthur Sackler he was the eldest brother so he was a patriarch he kind of and he brought in his two brothers into the business and he was originally a doctor but his first hit was as he was a doctor he started an advertising age agency a medical advertising agency and he studied copywriting that was his thing he learned about copywriting through a traditional agency where he would work at a traditional agency at nights and weekends in order to help pay the bills and he was like copywriting is awesome I got to do this for Valium or this other drug this other drug and so all these huge pharmaceutical companies at the time this was in the 50s 60s and eventually 70s like um what what's that big one Roche r-o-c-h-e I believe that they were the inventors of Valium and they start saying Hey Arthur your little agency we hear you have good ideas what are your ideas he's like well we have to hire a sales force then we're going to create these ads we're not allowed to advertise towards consumers but we can advertise towards doctors and they popularize volume by making it like an everyday drug like oh if you're a little stressed and you know just like you would take an Advil pop a v you'll be calm and they have like Housewives vacuuming in pearls like with a Valium uh like logo or he also popularizes his tranquilizers so he makes them popular so he builds up this uh agency but in secrecy he does two things that are interesting one he finds his competition is another medical pharmaceutical Ad Agency and he buys half of it and so what they what he does is he eventually Corners the market for pharmaceutical uh advertising and he owns the other one secretly and he'll say stuff like look you don't want to work with us fine go to our competitors they sound like they're a good fit for you and they collude together on how to like Market together and like which techniques are working the second thing that he does is he creates this thing called the medical Tribune it's a bi-monthly newsletter for doctors so he's in the newsletter industry it's a free thing a free newsletter that is eventually read by 300 400 500 000 doctors and he what he does is no one knows at the time that he owns it but he starts using his original company MacArthur for advertising buys ads in the medical Tribune and through this he it creates two huge companies and that is how he creates his original fortune and I found I went and like dug through the newspapers.com that's one of my favorite sources you can find old newspaper clippings I found some of the numbers so check this out so McAdams sorry I called it MacArthur it's called McAdams when he died the company was doing 170 million dollars a year in revenue and that was in 1985 I believe uh it had 170 employees and then his other company medical Tribune it was it was not sold for a significant amount of money it actually sold uh for around 70 million dollars to Axel Springer who also bought morning Brew uh our friend Austin's company so I've been giving them a hard time about this um Austin Sackler yeah for sure Austin zachler and so annual revenues for medical Tribune range between 50 to 80 million dollars in the last few years of existence this was in the late 80s and adjusted for today that's around 150 to 200 million dollars a year he also Arthur while he was doing this he was buying he owned like three New York City Town Homes he was making seven sometimes eight figure dollar donations uh to our uh to uh museums and he had an art collection valued at 60 million dollars when he died I think he was 75 that was in the late 80s he was worth around 150 million dollars which today is around 400 million dollars maybe five or six years after that that's when oxy was created but besides the fact that these guys are you know do illegal horrible unethical things what's crazy is this guy owned two companies that were doing close to each of them over 100 million dollars a year and it was medical advertising and a medical newsletter for doctors and he owned it was him and his wife owned the whole thing so like super fascinating background story uh about how this guy originally got wealthy wow prolific prolific family uh for sure that's crazy that's a crazy story it's crazy so a lot of the stuff like that the Purdue family or the Saxon family is about it's about oxycat and I thought that was interesting but what I thought was really interesting was just like I was like well just from an entrepreneur's perspective how to get started and so I did all this research right dug deep and then I went into like a I used this thing it's like a historical money calculator and so it helps you calculate how much money is worth today I then went looked at real estate prices from the 70s and 80s in New York City and I found out how much he was paying for homes and I found and I basically like reverse engineered like the income from this medical newsletter because I was just curious how it works I think by the way that still works today uh and uh there was another company I don't know if you remember this but there was a company that used to give out free TVs to Doctors TV and these TVs had like skeletons on them and you could like you could like move the skeleton around in order to like show like all right your colon is actually right here and we'll zoom in on that but on the TV was ads for drugs and this company eventually got in trouble interestingly enough for fraud it turns out they were lying about a lot of stuff but this pharmaceutical industry is so interesting to me because it's something that we're supposed to trust turns out it's a lot of it's and it's just as shady as someone would say that this my free cams website is or even worse and it's really fascinating how this whole industry works but medical newsletters super fascinating a legit company Axel Springer which is a five billion dollar German newspaper company bought it and so I actually think these still work today and if you go on TV still running by the way or no no they shut it down they uh I believe they shut it down and like everything involving sacklers like people don't have anything to do with it but if you um if you're on do you ever watch cables TV yeah sometimes dude it's only car commercials and Drug commercials that's like all it is it's like Cialis and like it's so anyway this pharmaceutical advertising industry it's I would never enter it but it's really fascinating how it's done and it's incredibly lucrative it created this fortune and I think it could still create more well I put this out there before which was that um we get asked a bunch about uh hey I'm doing a newsletter can you help can you invest can you advise whatever and we've basically I think both of us say no to pretty much all of them the one that I think is interesting still or two the two areas that I am interested is who's doing an amazing job of this in real estate who's doing an amazing job of this for the newsletter for doctors those are the two that I really care about and I'm like I really want to find whoever's doing a great job of that and uh you know invest or advise or partner with them to like help make that bigger because I think those spaces are amazing spaces if you have the right person going like doing it the right way there's a lot of nuance to it but um yeah I still think this idea would just work again and they sell for huge multiples so aging media did this for nursing homes so someone senior living here yeah somewhat related I I don't remember the multiple but I heard rumors it was like 15 times profit which is really great uh and so these businesses are still super lucrative and I think what Arthur did um whether you think that's good or bad the way that he did it I think is bad inherently I don't think it's bad but the way that he did it is I think it's still incredibly lucrative our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better let me tell you another story about a a smart weirdo all right so here's here's the smartest episode smart smart weirdos slash maybe bad people um this guy I don't think is considered bad but uh he's my Billy of the week [Applause] [Music] a million dollars isn't cool you know it's cool a billion dollars Okay so we've had we have some actually multiple contenders this is a billion of the week uh run off actually a a maybe this is actually a campaign but this guy is is um doing something interesting so his name's Steve Davis uh you probably don't know who that is just because it's a fairly generic name but um and if you Google his name it's a it's a professional snooker player what is that pool yes some kind of like pool if you if you had like you know the wrong color balls or something um so this guy is Elon musk's long trusted like right hand man so let me tell you about this guy he um joined SpaceX back in 2003 so very early on um crazy background he's got a twin master's degree in particle physics and aerospace engineering right so you know guy's got a dome on him and he but I think what he was doing I think he was doing something like completely unrelated but he was one of the first employees that ended up getting hired by SpaceX for some reason I feel like I remember he wasn't like working in the industry he was doing something else and then he got hired and um the stories about this guy are kind of legendary so when when Elon bought Twitter people were like who's gonna uh who's he gonna make CEO and a lot of people were like it's going to be Steve Davis before he put the the lady from NBC in charge which was sort of a weird pick it seemed like it was gonna be Steve Davis why because Steve Davis was living and sleeping in the Twitter office with his wife and their newborn child for like three weeks what a brown noser intense so this guy um if you go read the stories about him it's like it's like a folklore so uh one person said he's been working six hours a day every single day seven days a week for years and years another person said he's insane he gets more work done than 11 people working together just himself what one time um one time Elon Musk uh they were doing something with the production of of a part in in uh one of the parts of the of the rocket I guess and this was a 120 000 part and elon's like we need to get this down to five thousand dollars and nobody was everyone's like what are you talking about like yeah of course I wish I wish it was free too but like that's just not how things work yeah he's like five thousand dollars and he just left the room right and Steve Davis takes that as a personal challenge he's just working for months and months to try to figure out how can we do this for 5K instead of 120k he ends up getting it done for three three thousand nine hundred dollars he figures out a way to do it he emails Elon so excited Elon we did it after months we figured out how to lower the price of this part down to only only less than four thousand dollars you said five we got it unless four Elon just replies okay period it doesn't matter Steve Davis is undeterred from this and he he just keeps going he's become uh now he's the CEO of boring company so elon's like uh you know third company or whatever that he that he created after uh all that right and that company's legit right boring company they actually are making stuff or is it just like a t-shirt company no they are doing things but there's a lot of criticisms like uh cool like how um you know how is that tunnel going yeah right like where's what's going on you you dug this tunnel but like it's only compatible with Teslas and they have to put like rollerblades on before they go through it's like I don't know this seems kind of shitty right dude I want my cities to look like swiss cheese just holes all over the place like what's what's going on you're just selling flamethrowers and so you know on one hand they have improved the speed of of boring of actually digging the tunnels um but the reason I found this guy interesting so not only is he like uh elon's right-hand man that you haven't heard of that you know I find that interesting uh not only is he probably worth maybe a billion dollars at this point like based on the SpaceX stock as appreciated like crazy since 2003 but um this guy's totally weird so he just is he's got a great sense of humor that he takes into business okay so uh he uh basically Elon sends him Elon trusts him right he's like hey we need somebody on the ground in uh you know he's got like this like city in Texas and like at one point he sent him to DC for uh a lot like you know they needed to be near uh DC because a lot of their contracts are government contracts so he's like send Steve out to DC from California and Steve's living there he's doing his job but he's like God you know what I miss I miss just having great frozen yogurt he's like they don't have that DC he's like all I got is this crap I missed the California frozen yogurt you know what so as a side job from his very important job at SpaceX he opens up a froyo shop called Mr yogato and he that just opens it up he goes and he works there after work for fun what and so he goes and he works there and he starts to make it fun for himself he creates just a bunch of ridiculous policies so if you go to Mr yogato if you can stump him with a Seinfeld question your froyo's free if you come in dressed as uh Bjorn Borg or whatever the like tennis player or not I don't use a there's a musician or something you get 25 off if you let him stamp Mr yogato on your forehead 10 off and so he created this long list of rules essentially on the secret menu um for what he could do and then when he had to leave he had to move away uh you know SpaceX needed him in some other place he's like ah I'm not gonna be able to go work in my yogurt shop after work uh okay um hey come whoever comes to Mr yogato today one of you is gonna get the shop for a dollar and he just gave the shop to some guy for a dollar at the end he's like here's the keys the only rules um I want to keep uh you know being able to come here and eat half off and um you know uh and also you got to keep some of the the the the the rules alive like if you can recite a speech from Braveheart in a Scottish accent 20 off and so he so he does this yogurt shop he also at one point the the headline if you Google Mr yogato is it's a from an article in the Washingtonian says Twitter's next CEO might be the Mr yogato dude yeah he goes bro like the rules are amazing you just you should go look at the rules of this rule number eight anyone wearing a kickball uniform and has played hard evidenced by dirt on their knees will automatically receive 10 off their yogurt anybody who can reenact the 47 second Michael Jackson Thriller dance 20 off if you perform a shorter choreographed dance you can get 10 off actually genius by the way order a yoga for 30 consecutive days and we'll name them a flavor after you I mean this guy's awesome yeah so he's having a good time so then he opens up a bar called Thomas Foolery short name tomfoolery and same things uh instead you know every bar has a happy hour he created the angry hour where if you shout your order of the drink to the bartender angrily you get a discount on your drink um you know they served like cookies and ice cream at this thing and he's like this is a place where we're going to take you back to being a kid but with alcohol oh my God and I was like dude I love this guy this guy is uh hilarious and weird and all the best ways and I just went down this rabbit hole because his this guy kind of fascinates me there's nothing about this guy really on the internet nobody does interviews with him um people discovered this mystery Elgato thing but there's not much out there about him how'd you find that there's only a few times uh that's like you know part you know just digging in like what are some of the other craziest things that this guy does when they announced um the boring company it was a press conference with Elon and some guy the some guy is Steve Davis sitting next to him during the the talk and what they did was to make their points I I kind of love this marketing to make their point that like why did you create the boring company and he was like well in like whatever 100 years we haven't gotten any faster at drilling like we're still the same speed we were like 50 75 years ago at digging these tunnels nobody's done anything Innovative and to do when they did the press conference it's them talking but around them is a circular track and on that track they put us little like a snail or a slug or something and it was just walking around the track super slowly to represent how slow this industry is and how slow other people are Drilling and at the end of the two hour seminar it was still only halfway around the thing oh my God and they're like you know that's the industry today and we're gonna change it I love these little nuggets these little sort of like marketing gimmicks that make a point in the sort of simplest most uh memeable viral way possible uh you know I Gotta Give Elon credit and uh this guy Steve Steve credit for how they do that where where did you work before how do you get a job with Elon uh well just early on you know if your twin master's degree in particle physics and aerospace engineering there's not that many places to go work you work in NASA or you work you know uh Boeing or you go work here right so he got a job there early on and just like started grinding like crazy and that's why like even now just sort of grinds like crazy sleeping in the office with the with his newborn the child that was just like his wife just just gave birth I have a rule we have a rule in our house in the in the par house where I will only sleep under another man's roof for one night and if it's my father if it's my father-in-law's house he gets two nights I don't like sleeping in another man's home it's the most emasculating thing on earth I can't imagine moving my wife and newborn baby into the Twitter office can you move to my boss now yeah my boss's house like elon's like hey how's our wife doing like you're like a billionaire yeah you're not like an intern yeah you're you're like I I don't even like I don't stay at another man's house I don't even like staying at my father's law's house let alone staying at the Twitter HQ can you imagine with a newborn with a newborn or a baby I can't imagine that that's not for me dog what's your phrase cornrows and face tattoos yeah it's not for me but I'm glad freaks like you exist yes but God it exists sleeping at the office with my wife and baby you got you can have that I'm happy you exist but that ain't for me is there any part of you that is envious of this guy because I don't find any amount of Envy other than I appreciate his sense of humor oh yeah I think this guy is great I think uh do I want to be him no that's what I mean do I think that this guy's probably you know this guy's interesting and it seems like he uh thinks differently and I think I could learn or be inspired by it sure for sure for example I went deep uh so one so one of the things he did while he was working at SpaceX and they moved him to DC in addition to the yogurt shop he went to George Mason and got like a PhD and his thesis I found his thesis paper and I read it which was very hard I don't want to go into too much detail on it how did you find this when I'm Googling him I can't you can barely find anything it's the same like four photos just a lot of grit determination you're the Steve you're the Steve Davis Steve Davis exactly I applied to searching researching other great men more so than being one myself slept under a couch for literally hours to find this it was literally I ignored [Laughter] so I'm just gonna read you two things so first of the paper the reason I really liked it is it's about the debasement of the US currency I think he wrote this in uh what year was this it's basically like very or it's very early it's that kind of like early Bitcoin days so let me just search Steve Davis basement um so yeah 2010 and his paper is called the trend towards the debasement of the American currency and he talks does that mean is that the bottom does that mean devaluing so so you know he he talks about the history of like you know basically uh you know I don't have my notes in front of me now but like uh one of the things he talks about is you know um did you take notes on this one just for yourself yeah um so I was like you know he's like one dollar or whatever you know one or so one ounce of gold was worth this many dollars before and now that same ounce of gold requires whatever like you know 100 x more dollars like basically like we used to be Peg to Gold we got off the gold standard and look at how look at how much the dollar is devalued relative to gold in that time and he's basically like there's a trend towards the debasement of um of currency and he talks about like people think this is like a you know overtime slow slow thing but actually like 95 of the debasement has just happened in the last like 40 50 years or something like that uh like it has accelerated quickly and this is not just like uh yeah this is not just like you know a slow thing um all right here we go so 98.3 has occurred from 19 1792 to the present time but even if you shorten that like still 90 of it happened in a very short window of time he talks about why he talks about how he talks about like what that why that's such a big problem and this is basically like a a cryptocurrency like you're not talking about Bitcoin in it but this is like this is crypto is a solution to this problem right like Bitcoin could not be debased exactly uh which is like the meme but it's it's also like uh the truth you know it's like these things are cliche because they're there's an element of Truth and then that's why they stick around in his acknowledgments in this paper so he says oh I want to I want to thank this professor or this professor I want to thank this person and at the end he's like I want to thank my mom and dad he's like finally thanks to the unknown Chef that makes great brownies at the small Enterprise Hall cafeteria hopefully they will one day become a topping at Mr yogato or its successor little yo-hai this guy's just hilarious man this guy is just so funny to me and uh yeah there's like 100 page paper if you want to go read the most impressive part is that you read this guy's thesis paper and you've got as far as to the acknowledgments at the end no no acknowledgment's at the beginning was for my friend that's like the uh the thank you at the beginning of a book uh so I didn't read the whole thing there's 162 page thesis I've read like 40 pages maybe uh step by step step by step where the debasement started it and how it happened and I'm like oh wow this is fascinating like I never knew any of this is that we have to do to become a PhD is to write a 140 page like original work on something that's amazing I didn't think I didn't know that thesis were that long not only do we not have a PhD we honestly don't even know what the hell a PhD is or what it takes to get one I used to tell people I had my PhD I thought I meant poor hardworking and driven uh like that was my joke I I play a hate and degree yeah I didn't realize that it's you have to write a hundred plus page like report on this that's amazing I'm not that hungry and driven yeah yeah definitely not that sounds really challenging uh by the way one of the great get to know you questions in the business world that's sort of dorky but actually is a good one which is if you had to give an impromptu 45 minute talk on a subject what would you give it on like for you it might be like copywriting or newsletters right like something like that the history of denim what I'm not joking I could do it you want to talk about denim I got you what would yours be there is no answer that is better than that answer I don't want to continue the podcast [Laughter] the things about looms is in the previous yeah shadow looms pre-1944 were particularly special but no I could talk all about it and then post-war what Japan was rebuilding Hiroshima they needed just a ton of machinery and that's what the shutter looms of America went to Japan I mean I could do it that's insane all right your your turn what's your topic where do we go from here um you want to do Post pilot I like post pilot all right let's talk about I invested in post pilot did you yeah me too um I didn't you know I don't like as you call it talk in your own book too much I don't like talking about stuff that I'm involved in but since we're both involved about it and we're up front we could talk about it we'll explain what it is first yeah so let's talk about it so our connection to post pilot is with the owner his name is Drew but he actually bought the company and the reason he bought the company was because he owned um he used to buy software company so he bought design and public.com he bought he bought karmaloop.com and then he owned this thing called AutoAnything which was an auto parts store and the thing about uh his whole like Playbook is that he would buy these uh time companies and he would be like well your email list stinks so we can like improve that we could do this we can do that and one of the things that he used to do with these companies that worked really well was he would email or mail them like snail mail them like flyers and Direct Mail pamphlets on the company however it was really hard to do it was like a painstaking process and so he bought this company called post pilot he bought it I think he bought it for sixty thousand dollars and what it does is if you're a Ecom brand you just sign up to post pilot and they plug in I think to Shopify to woocommerce to like a lot of the popular platforms and they have a done for you service meaning they'll help you design a pamphlet that you could send to not only your customers but I think some of your email subscribers and people who haven't already bought from you and they can send direct mail in a click of a button and so what he has found like this whole thesis is like look if I have an email list and some of these companies that I bought their email list was a hundred thousand people but ninety thousand people wouldn't even open the email ten thousand would but how do I get the other 90 000 people to interact with me well let's just send them mail and so they created a process that you can use someone's address that they've already supplied to or I believe what they do is you can um you can use someone's email and phone number and help use other data sources to find out roughly where you live and they'll send mail to you or that area or people who match your it's like a look-alike audience and they send you mail and they could track if you eventually bought something through their mail so it's a very Roi positive business Roi positive marketing channel and I think he bought this company in 2018. he bought it for 60 Grand it's making well over 60 Grand a day now I think that the last the the public information that they said was they crossed 10 million a year in Revenue uh like 18 months ago I think and it's growing like a weed and he sends amazing investor updates uh where like there'll be like a theme so for example him and his co-part or him and his partner sent an update where it was him and his partner dressed like Step Brothers uh and so like he does these really funny updates but the business is growing like a weed it's growing crazy and they're um it's really fascinating is that what what I'm not an econ guy is that what you what yeah so we use it so so we use it and like you know if you do advertise on Facebook or you advertise on Google and you know the key metric for any eCommerce brand is your return on ad spend uh when it comes to marketing so you spend 100 on ads what's your return are you gonna get 100 back you're gonna get 200 back and get fifty dollars back fifty dollars would be a point five percent on ad spend 200 would be a 2.0 uh original announcement you can be like getting a 2.0 return on ad spend at scale you're printing money right yeah you're putting in 100 you're getting 200 out every single day and um that's uh you know obviously if you could scale that up that's that's extremely extremely lucrative if you use postpilot you can get like a 10x return on ad spend it's not the most scalable but it is pretty ridiculous the type of return you get he said a lot of people are getting 5 to 10x um he said most retention campaigns come in between five and ten five and ten uh so like he kills it they I don't use it yeah these are these are like retention right so you're you know you're trying to get uh people to come back or you're trying to get a warm lead who hasn't bought from you but they gave you their their info to try to convert so it's you know obviously different for a completely new customer versus returning customer versus whatever but the Blended uh row as for these is really really good so it's very effective right you send a postcard it's got a bunch of it's got a photos he's got photos on it it's got an offer on it and uh the cool thing what they did was they basically took this they weren't the first to do you know how do you send mail campaigns we'll send it for you what they did was they're treating it like it's clavio so most people outside of e-comers don't even know about clavio except for the fact that it just filed to go Publix and now a bunch of people are paying attention to this like 10 billion dollar company that raised very little money email marketing for um for e-commerce actually it didn't raise the very little it raised 400 million it only Burns sorry net 15 million dollars which shows how Capital efficient that's what I mean yeah sorry um so every econ brand basically uses clavio at this point um it is like the the the dominant player in the space there's some others like send lane or whatever but they basically said we're gonna automate this so like we will take all your Co your customer data from Shopify and we'll be like cool um when somebody first joins we'll put make a welcome flow so automatically it'll drip out like one hour after they do after they sign up for emails they'll get this three days later with a look at this later they'll get that clavio yeah yeah and now what postpile did was they took the same thing they're like cool you want to send a one-off blast you can just go in our editor and do that you want to create automated flows that are just going to be triggered based on customer Behavior you can do that too so they basically did for physical mail the same thing that clavio did for digital mail which is very very smart um so yeah anyways I think they're they're doing really well and we'll see kind of how how big I think the only question of this one is just how big does it get it's a high floor unknown ceiling so it's like uh this business is definitely gonna work now the question is working is it a yeah even when we first invested it was like this clear this was gonna work and it was a delicious it was a low valuation compared to everything it was not low it was a reasonable valuation compared to everything else I think I have about 25 Grand in the company yeah I did something similar it was it wasn't it wasn't like you know massive massive bet but um you know the question is is this gonna be a 50 million business 100 million dollars it's a 500 million dollar business or a billion dollar business I have no idea on that one like we'll see but um but it's definitely like it was like a clear this isn't going to be a zero type of investment so I did this one personally not out of the fun because I was like you know you don't know the profile of this one I thought so I have 25 000 of my own money into the company I think I uh in my head when I was looking at it I was like I think the the the likely worst case scenario is that this will sell for 70 or 80 million dollars I was like I think I could 5x 4X my money I think in a unlikely but High outcome scenario I was like many many hundreds of millions of dollars this could sell for uh and I could for sure 100 10x this maybe more um that right that that was kind of my thinking with that investment and 25 000 of my own money is I I usually do small small checks that's a smaller checks that's a that's a good one for me right on um I have some other topics but I think we should save them one thing I want to do is I want to start doing episodes that are business ideas only so sometimes but basically if you take an episode of my personality you kind of don't know what you're gonna get there's a box you might get a billy of the week story about crazy people who have done crazy things you might get a business breakdown like we did with only fans just like here's a business here's the numbers here's how it's doing uh maybe it's a business like post pilot like a business you never heard of that's doing really well um we're kind of expose you to the sort of uh things that are under under the radar not not on your radar and then sometimes we do ideas and opportunities things that we think people could do that could be that could work and um Monday I say I proposing this to you Monday I think we should do uh when we record Monday we should do business ideas only I think uh I think we're good Monday and I have a good one which are people's favorites that the business ideas and opportunities there's definitely people's favorites um so we'll do that but you know if we're gonna do that people got to do something for us right like I don't know about you but if I kiss I like to get kissed back if I hugged back and if I provide value I like to get value Yes means yes and all we need from you to give value back put your wallet away you know we don't it doesn't take money it's not free though it ain't free it ain't free it sure as hell ain't free but but your money's no good here what we do need is for you to take that little finger of yours open up the podcast app click subscribe go to my first building click subscribe the next thing you're gonna do where do they do that YouTube where do they do that they do on Spotify any Spotify Apple podcast whatever whatever is your comfortable place I'm not trying to get you to go somewhere you're not comfortable right go where you're comfortable well just make sure you're click and subscribe Now go to YouTube go open YouTube type in my first million click subscribe hit the little bell so you get alerts we need both of those things from you we just need it and I don't ask for much but I ask for this don't let me down and if you want leave a comment you could leave a comment we read all of them and we even the funniest ones we send to each other particularly if they make fun of us yeah the most insulting ones definitely get the most attention and uh we can't resist we're not one of those we're not those people who are like nah I don't read the comments I don't read the haters read all of them yeah I think about you and I recognize usernames you're living in our head yes I've Googled some of these people I do a reverse Google image search and find out they're LinkedIn and here I'll actually leave uh I'll leave like a hint so for next Monday you you can see on here which company I'm talking about if you scroll down so I was going to start this with a business that used to exist that was way ahead of its time that I think should exist today now is the time now is the time if you could possibly pull this off you agree with me do you see what company I'm talking about I know what you're talking about I agree with you I can't wait to talk to you about that one and I have one that is um similar to one of the best businesses in Andrew Wilkinson's portfolio and I think you could create a new version of that that would work really well that's the teaser all right Manic Monday we'll call it I don't know we'll just go from ideas to ideas or where we just look at the comments and just stress out over like blemishes we have on our face but it's Manic Monday so you don't have to pay money for this show but it ain't for free and and you know how you know how to pay for it so all right that's the part [Music]

Andrew Tate is what men with no self-esteem think High self-esteem looks like unpack that a little bit so it's funny like watching the rise of Tate because he's like a copy and paste of 20 million plus copies sold the champion the no [ __ ] Champion official title I think Mark Manson welcome welcome thank you when subtle art came out and it blew up and it was like at the top all the best seller lists and stuff like everybody in the publishing industry were like oh you're like the new Phenom debuted author overnight success I'm like overnight success I've been grinding on a Blog for 10 years like what do you mean overnight success were you good at the beginning or did you stop oh dude that was a [ __ ] disaster I was a total disaster you obviously became a great writer but I want to talk about what you're doing now which is the YouTube video or the YouTube channel and it's not like the main thing when I saw Mr Beast a light bulb went off I was like I love Mr Beast and like I've been watching his [ __ ] for a long time but one of my frustrations with him is that it's all very [Music] intro to the camera here we got three-time New York Times bestseller I believe yeah we have uh 20 million plus copies sold the champion the no [ __ ] Champion official title I think uh Mark Manson welcome welcome thank you good to be here uh been a fan for a while um although I gotta admit I read like a ton of your blogs and I didn't read the book until like I said I've actually finished the book but until we booked this interview I was like I should probably go and read the actual book that he's most famous for yeah but there's something to like the fun of like oh I liked his his old [ __ ] you know like the cool band thing I was a fan before he was cool yeah that that whole thing yeah so when I was writing that intro I was like this is pretty great pretty impressive yeah but I always wonder this like when you were younger like let's say let's say a researcher was watching you when you were like I don't know between the ages of 10 and 20. would it have been noticeable that you approached things a little different even when you were younger I was definitely different when I was young for sure I don't think it would have been obvious that I would I would I was gonna end up an author or in the personal development industry or whatever but uh you know my whole life my teachers were like Mark's different he's special we wish he would do his homework uh we wish he would stay awake in class but he could do great things one day like that was kind of the constant refrain throughout my childhood because you just weren't interested in school or what was the situation yeah I was bored and and I would I would just whatever I was into that's just kind of what I like I used to bring poker books to class and read them in the middle like physics class and my teachers would get mad at me I'm like well I'm just like studying poker you know were you big into like yeah during like the Chris Moneymaker phase basically yeah that's cool um did you ever like go all in on it I tried so it's funny um early on in college I I decided to sit down and take it really seriously I made a few thousand bucks which when you're like 19 or 20. it's massive right I'm like oh my God I can pay rent all summer my poker winnings and then uh you were in college yeah so you're paying like you know 20 grand for school but ignoring school to make 300 in a sit and go exactly like I've stayed up till 5 a.m like I made 200 bucks last night right um and and then I hit my first big downswing and lost like half my bankroll in like maybe three days four days right and I was like oh [ __ ] I don't think I can pay rent this month you know I'm like this kind of sucks actually yeah it's like a very very unhealthy uh unhealthy life I love the game but the lifestyle that it requires like the grinding the the patience like the the emotional fortitude to like handle the ups and downs it's yeah after about six months I was like I don't think I'm built for this right and you there's a lot of like degenerates you end up hanging around around like okay uh doing it so you kind of look around you're like this isn't healthy it's like yeah yeah it's like they're not smoking but there's like a secondhand smoke of their like life that's like I don't want to be inhaling right now for sure for sure so I think we had kind of a similar um set of Interest maybe it's like very common for I don't know guys that are going through some Rites of Passage it's like yeah you think you can play poker or like count cards in blackjack I mean yeah yeah and then you sort of move on to like the next phase yeah exactly um where you know there's a I think 2005. a book comes out that I know influenced you it influenced me yep uh do you know what I'm talking about where's the game the game Neil Strauss yep ironically my girlfriend my girlfriend in high school before I went to college we were like yeah let's break up we're going to college and yeah two different places we were pretty mature about it but she was like here's a book and I was like that's the best backhanded compliment gift I've ever received it's like your girlfriend giving you a book called The Game and it's like you need this for college yeah yeah um describe how did you find it and what was like the next 24 hours after you started reading it you know it's funny it it hit me at depending on your perspective the exact best or worst moment possible um so my first girlfriend in high school had just cheated on me and left me for another dude and I was completely heartbroken just gutted you know weepy whiny and sucks even more in high school because like leaving you is like she's still there yeah right yeah yeah we're still in the hallway yeah well I Would by this time I was in college okay but like we had gotten together in high school anyway it was we didn't we didn't you made the right move so we didn't split up we were like oh we're in love we're gonna make it work I'm gonna drive back every other week and all this [ __ ] and it's like no that's a horrible idea and so of course she found another guy you should actually look in the camera be like to the person do that 18 right now don't do that it's not gonna work the long distance girlfriend when you both go to college you just don't do it and uh so anyway I I was absolutely heartbroken and distraught and just had like very angry and confused and I remember being in a bookstore and seeing seeing that book like on the table and I remember my first reaction was discussed I was like it's like what is this like who would read this right and then I'm like yeah yeah maybe I'll read a few pages and and I mean Neil's such a good writer like it talk about somebody who knows how to like hook your attention and kind of suck you into a world um yeah I just I think I sat down and read probably the first 50 hundred Pages there in the bookstore uh and then I think I read the entire thing in just a couple days and and that was pretty much it like I was like all right like you know the one girl who ever liked me completely [ __ ] me over broke my heart and every other girl I've ever met seems to have no interest so clearly I'm not doing something right you know like I'm willing to give anything a go at this point and uh so yeah I I kind of got sucked into that world for um well I guess four years five years uh and then it eventually kind of stumbled into my first business was in that world as well yeah and I want to talk about that because I think it's again like I it was like a formative phase of my life too and so today I think a bunch of people rightfully so you know like like you admire you follow you and you like add a lot of value to people's lives right like even though self-help kind of like sometimes gets a bad rap like you're almost by definition helping people with yourself frankly the most important thing but I would say like it's probably a rabbit hole you went down now and content you create now but that previous Rabbit Hole you went down and content you created was around uh there it is there it is uh oh yeah this is your first book right yep uh models attract women through honesty yep um at least that subtitle is like you know well we can get to this in a second but before that that was a very very intentional yeah that that's jumping ahead a couple years but yeah so let's start with okay so you read the game you get you know kind of the uh I always say this about Tim ferriss's book the four hour work week is like after you read that book you have the four hour fever yep so for the next four hours you reconsider your entire life and like a fever dream yeah and I just tell people that when I give them the book I'm like you're gonna have let's schedule some time you're gonna need this weekend to have the four hour fever um same kind of thing happens with the game and you become you start I guess you describe it you start practicing it so let's start start with like you start actually practicing it for people who haven't read the game and don't know the core principles of it like what stood out to you at that time of like oh I used to do things this way but this is like this kind of thing I'm learning this new skill I'm learning well so the there's a funny thing about the game which is and it's it's funny too because I would put the four hour work week in this category as well and that those are if I was to make a list of like the five most impactful books that I've ever read in my life those two would be on the list for sure right that said I don't actually like the majority of advice in both of those books I don't think actually was applicable to me or actually worked for me right it was more just showing what was possible right so um and definitely more so in in the game's case than for you know for our work week it it it's primarily principles and mindsets you know my my issue with the four hour work week was that it just it made it sound way easier than it was it's it's you know the the real four hour work week is uh you know work 16 hours a day so you can make money while you sleep um but with the game I think the the really powerful concept that was very life-changing was that social skills and dating are skills that you can practice and get better at right like that never occurred to me it just occur like up to that point in my uh my life like most young people I just kind of assumed like well either girls are into you or they're not right and if they're not you're kind of you're kind of [ __ ] right right or not [ __ ] in that case but like it so reading that book and being like oh you can actually go out and practice and get better social skills and get better at being sexual and flirting and and connecting with women and doing all these things like that those are all skills that you can practice like that was very revelatory for me that said when I actually went out and tried to do the stuff in the game which was a bunch of cheesy pickup lines and they call them routines like we're like stories magic routines stories you would memorize and all this stuff it was a [ __ ] disaster like it was just it was completely corny and and I felt very inauthentic and out of place but like what was impactful is that it got me out of the house and like talking to women on a regular basis and I realized like hey if I actually just get myself in front of a bunch of cute girls I'm actually I'm not that bad like I can talk I can make a joke like I can use my own personality as a starting point and just build from there right and so that's kind of what I started doing through throughout College and by the end of college I kind of had developed a reputation as the big party guy the player you know the guy who had four different girlfriends or whatever for me I had the same experience you had except for uh the lamest Moment The Rock Bottom moment is when you hear another guy saying the same thing because he read the same book and you're like oh [ __ ] there's like 100 of us running around yeah it's like this thing I was gonna say by itself was actually a little bit cringe yeah maximally cringe if she heard this from another guy and I was like oh okay I can't just like it there's no memorizing your way to success here but the principles I thought were good and you're right the forcing function of like getting you to like kind of uh believe the self-confidence to believe that this might actually work that you can actually approach somebody and have a good conversation and that that could lead to something yeah it was like pretty powerful yeah I even do this with podcasts like I have like a note of like what's the first thing I want to talk about with you like I kind of know that the next 90 minutes will be great either way sure but that first minute is like the social anxiety piece which is like the same thing with with these pickup artists which was like most people just aren't even approaching anyone yeah with anything that's a interest that might lead to a conversation um so for me that was like the bigger thing do you uh still have that kind of like do you think about that moment of social anxiety that first um that first moment in like was the game helpful in like getting those Reps for sure I mean I I had a lot of social anxiety when I was young and and it's funny because it took me a long time to appreciate that that you know because when you're kind of naive and a newbie you look at all the pickup lines and you think it's the pickup line that's working right and it's like no it's actually the pickup line is just the excuse to kind of get you through your anxiety to give give you the courage to actually go say something it doesn't really matter what you're saying right and uh I actually had a very Ford you know kind of like you hearing over here and another guy say a word I actually got very lucky early on because I was trying to use some of the stuff I read in the game I started I tried to do like some [ __ ] coin magic tricks and stuff like just total disaster and uh I remember I I I was having no luck whatsoever and I actually got very fortunate in that I was in a bar or something I was talking to these three girls and I was like trying to do a magic trick and they were like really into it and really excited and I kept [ __ ] it up and then like it kind of got awkward and at a certain point they realized they're like wait like you're just doing a thing like kind of hit on us and I'd like tried to make a joke and it was super lame or something and they kind of rolled their eyes and they started to walk away and I was like wait I have another magic trick and I remember one of the girls turned around and she looked at me and she was like you know you were kind of cute like you should just be yourself I was like you know like had to explode and almost and and that was kind of one of those first moments where I'm like you know what like why don't I just start like use my personality as the Baseline and then iterate on stuff that already feels natural and trying to instead of trying to be like some [ __ ] weird dude in a book right you know that I can't believe I spent ten thousand dollars in two years of my life studying all this [ __ ] I could have just like walked up and been like hi where are you from right and it would have gotten me the exact same results there's a book that's like uh food diet book I haven't even read the book but the last page of the book is like a summary uh you might know the book because you're you're an author um it's like here's the like after all the studies and all the diets because like you know there's like a trillion diets out there and like they're like some are super super complicated you're like you know peeing on a strip to see if you're like in ketosis or not yeah yeah you can do you can take it to the nth degree and it was like yeah so it seems like the rules are um you know eat real food like not like package processors like eat real food not too much yeah and like and it was like that was like basically the the core of the advice yeah and it's like oh yeah and like but if you actually intensely followed that you get all the results you want but like there's this thing where we sort of search for this like other answer the secret answer yes it can't possibly be just that there there's a weird thing that happens in a lot of these industries which is the concepts and frame Frameworks that sell well are often counterproductive right and you see this in diet nutrition you see this in exercise for sure you see this in social skills personal development self-help you see it in the pickup world like it's really sexy like when a guy stands up and he says I have a three-step model that works every time and you're gonna get laid like tile and you're gonna lose 100 pounds and you know it's really sexy and you really want to buy it and you like want to believe it and it works and it makes people millions of dollars but then it doesn't actually it's not actually good advice right whereas the good advice like this is the other hard thing about these industries is that the good advice is boring and so and the things that work and again this is true in personal development it's true social skill is true with diet nutrition everything the stuff that works is boring it's it's not the information that's hard it's simply doing it it's implementing right consistently over a long period of time that's the hard part and there's no easy way to sell a solution to that so the easy thing to sell a solution for is you know my three steps at work every time and I see this everywhere like because I'm mostly in the kind of startup business World um and like you know Warren Buffett uh they're like you know Warren you're pretty open about your strategies yeah um and they're not like that complicated um why do you think that more people don't do this and it was either Hammer Charlie Munger that were like because nobody wants to get rich slow yep it's like yeah we just did this in public and he's like you know I made most of my wealth like from the ages of 70 to 90. and like uh you know nobody wants to do that nobody wants to hear that yeah they want to hear that guy who's not done this yeah tell them that they can do XYZ faster or in a different way in a complicated way that yeah you know you just didn't have the info now that you got the info now it's all gonna work yeah all right same thing like uh you know Y combinator which is the most successful like you know startup uh investor and and uh accelerator their number one advice is just make something people want and they're like What's the great startup advice like well but the the way it helps is like if you just tell someone that they don't know how to use it yeah but the quest like the audit when you're like so do you think that people want this they're like of course it was like cool so what tells you that what what evidence is showing you that people want this and they're like well we don't have any dude it's it's like that bell curve meme where it's like you know genius like just make something people want and then in the middle of the bell curve it's like well you've got to have these 12 steps and figure out these strategy you know and then the Jedi is like just make something people want I love that man that's right across so many domains it's amazing yeah and I catch myself all the time and I'm like I need what would the Jedi oh the Jedi would just say like yeah do it because it's fun instead of like yeah you know all these other things yeah um when you look back because Ben's been flashing a bunch of your like I know it's been been oh God he flashes a bunch of your things that are like this is the cringe section of that don't worry it gets better the interview will get better but this is the Korean section uh but you have like a bunch of these things that I'm like they're like just amazing headlines we're gonna talk titles later because you're like a title Master sure but when you look back do you how what's the meaning you put or like what's the label you put on these things I think we're both of the mindset that like life is not really about what happens it's kind of like what you what you make of it and also what you tell yourself the story you tell yourself about what happened yeah um so like when you look back on that phase is it just like um cringe and I don't want to ever think about like I hope my I forget about that is it like no that was actually really useful for me in these ways is it just funny now like what's your reaction now it's a really good question I I would say it's probably like one-third cringe one-third I think it was actually really important informative in a lot of ways and then one third just kind of funny and just like can you believe that happened uh actually when I moved out here to La um I met up with Neil for the first time and we spent a day together and we spent like half the day just kind of being like can you believe that happened right you believe we actually did that I I look back though especially now that a little bit more time has gone by I really do think that there was kind of an underrated factor and I think this is very relevant because this is starting to happen again with Gen Z with I think the pickup artist industry is underrated as a cultural or social phenomenon particularly for young men trying to find Identity or find themselves in like a very confusing world with a lot of information uh because it's when I look back at that time like yeah like we in the industry Co our the coaches we used to joke with each other it was like yeah we all came for the women but we stayed for the for the other dudes yeah like it's it's most of the guys who really got into that it wasn't about the girls it was they needed to feel accepted and and and validated by other men and and just I guess I don't know their masculinity right there's like a very there was like this yearning for like a masculine role model and I always found that I was very aware of that at the time but I didn't really know what to make of it uh but as the years have gone on I look back and I think like I think it blew up to the extent it did because because of that I don't think it was really about the dating or the girls I think it was just it was a generation of kind of post-feminism a generation of like men who had fewer father figures fewer Role Models a lot more confusion about like who they're supposed to be in the world and I think we're that's that cycle is coming back today and you're seeing a lot of that happen again with a different set of role models and uh a different industry well let's talk about one of them uh so I think Andrew Tate is like the for sure uh you know poster boy right now that uh thank you pull up that tweet he has you have a great tweet about energy I want to ask you yeah yeah Andrew Tate is what men with no self-esteem think High self-esteem looks like as a rule narcissism is is always mistaken for confidence by those who have no confidence from there it doesn't take much for the dynamic to turn abusive slash exploitive yeah so it's funny like watching Tate the rise of Tate because he just he's like a copy and paste of half the guys that were in that industry right you know it's like all the [ __ ] he says I'm like oh yeah I remember you know this guy used to say that oh yeah that guy used to say that too oh yeah that guy made a lot of money saying that you know like it's all the same [ __ ] just recycled in a new package I do think Tate is uniquely charismatic and I think he is an interesting backstory that a lot of young men respect right and so that that is it's given him a lot more amplification it's also just a different era with social media and everything uh but and he like layered on an MLM yeah yeah right so he just combined like three of the most powerful forces in the world seriously pretty insane Charisma with like this like cocktail of like words that cast a spell on young men yeah and then an MLM distribution model where he's like look cut up clips of me and post them everywhere and like that's how you rise in the ranks and you get like you're gonna make money by promoting me it's which is insane it's honestly somebody really needs to do uh I mean it probably we probably need some time but like 10 years from now I want to see somebody do like a really good book about him right and like a a fair book not like trying to smear like take an honest look of like who was this guy why did he blow up why did this work right like because it's I think it's easy obviously you can take the worst things that he said it's no secret some of the bad things he said and you can just hammer on those all day but like I think that's way less interesting than just trying to understand like why is there such a demand for this guy again right like I thought we kind of got over this and this kind of ties back into my first book models so like the pickup industry by like 2009 2010 I'd really really become burnt out on on just the toxicity of it and I I really felt that there were kind of two strains of dating relationship advice for men one was basically promoting narcissism selfishness power dynamics right and sure that stuff can get you laid a lot but it's it's at the expense of preventing any sort of happy or joyous long-term relationship or intimacy with any female ever right so you're like giving up that potential to just like put notches on your bed post and brag to your buddies and that is a very bad trade-off like if if you look at just in the terms of a man's overall lifespan that's a very bad trade-off um and then so I was I was kind of like okay how do we like detoxify this this advice what does that look like um how do we and it's not just about treating women with respect but it's treating yourself with respect too because like what a lot of guys don't realize is that yeah obviously if you objectify women it's bad for the women but it's bad for you too because you're objectifying yourself you're start you're basically just measuring Yourself by how wet your dick gets and like that's a very demeaning way to view yourself and view your own self-esteem and so I was kind of fed up with the whole thing I knew I wanted to get out I wanted to Pivot out of the industry and I was like well if I'm getting out of the industry I might as well just write the book that everybody needs to hear and nobody wants to hear which is that this is all toxic and [ __ ] up and stop doing it pretty good at the beginning or did you suck oh dude I was a [ __ ] disaster I was a total disaster um you do you want me to talk about the content side or the marketing side uh whatever's more interesting you you tell me well I'll I'll start with the content side it's less interesting but I'll start with it because it's quicker which is just like most my content was bad at first and I think that's true of anybody and you just get those reps in you know I I you back in the day back when blogs were still a thing I used to get asked all the time like how do I start a blog how do I grow a Blog make make a living as a blogger my answer was always the same which is like write 100 blog posts come ask me again right and uh have you seen by the way Mr Beast has like almost the exact verbatim answer yes and I love it because yeah it's the exact same thing I used to tell people and it's a combination of like it's actually the right advice because you need a bunch of reps and you need to suck for a little bit and get better just try to make each of the next video better and nobody's also it's a filter it's like are you serious or are you not serious yes I will help you if you're serious yes but 99 of you are not serious this is the easy task exactly exactly and the funny thing is too is that it's like most people if they go write a hundred blog posts and try to make each one better by the 100th one they don't need the advice anymore they know what they're doing wrong they know what they need to get better at so was there anything that got you better what did you read something or follow some or you know model your stuff after someone like do you remember how you got good in terms of writing and content my two big inspiration I was a huge Bill Simmons fan back in the day wow we were like very very alive yeah back in the day page you know page two yep and um it's I remember reading his call I was like his column each week was like an event in my life it was like I was so excited to go read it and I remember thinking I was like I want my art because back then the meta in this is pre-news feed pre-social media everything so like in the blogosphere the idea everything all traffic was either SEO or um the blog roll type thing yeah like link farming like you know you would like write something spicy so that a bunch of other bloggers would want to comment on it so they'd link to you and like all this stuff and it'd be it was very much a volume game so like the the standard advice was always you know don't write one big blog post a day write 20 20 single paragraphs and post those as individual blog posts each day just that's what's going to make you grow and I always hated that that always felt very shitty and uninspiring and so and I loved Bill Simmons and I was like man I want to be the Bill Simmons of my industry right right like I want to have these like Epic 10-page posts that that guys just get lost in and like you know they like schedule their week around right and you end up feeling like a friend it's like it's a hang yeah and I think it that probably hurt me in the short run and it helped me in the long run see it I tried to meet up with him when uh so we came out here I was like I want to schedule yeah who's my dream guest I was like I would love to have Bill Simmons on this because I don't he doesn't do a lot of like where he's the guest I don't I've never really seen any to be honest yeah he's like uh he's a big deal at Spotify now so yeah he's you know he's yeah that's fine but like whatever who cares he's written so if you ever if people ever read this go read uh I think it's called the consequences of caring unbelievable post so good uh anyway sorry continue so Bill Simmons inspired you to be like I don't need to like sell out to the algorithm the algorithm of that time the meta of that time yeah and it's I also think it helped that I I was in a pretty niche in uh insulated industry like everybody kind of knew each other and everybody talked about each other and everything so it it actually I think it helped me get get my name out even more because I was I did have a knack for writing it seemed and I did eventually start posting some pretty good stuff and um and so that kind of got talked about and shared do you remember what was uh like kind of your first thing that broke out and really in that era I really don't I really don't it was so gradual man like my it's funny because you know subtle art is so massive like I it was funny this is jumping ahead a little bit but like when subtle art came out and it blew up and it was like at the top all the best seller lists and stuff like everybody in the publishing industry were like oh you're like the new Phenom debuted author overnight success I was I'm like overnight success I've been [ __ ] grinding on a Blog for 10 years like what do you mean overnight success right yeah I was doing like you know that's like the low status thing in society like yeah I'm a blogger yes exactly so you're unemployed like what is that dude I got stories I got story I remember uh like 2013 2014 and by this time my like my audience was pretty big like I had a few hundred thousand readers and uh I remember going home for Christmas one year and uh kind of got in an argument with my parents and my my stepmom was just like when are you gonna get a real job and and and she was like you know I know such and such like they're hiring like a web designer you know you could go do that and I was like that'd be a waste of my time and she's like oh you could probably make a hundred thousand a year I was like I already make a hundred thousand a year and she just looked at me and she goes no you don't it's like I was like do you want tax returns like Jesus Christ what do I have to do to get you people to believe in me but uh anyway we're jumping around now um you know the con yeah the content side I don't know I just I had this weird confidence of like I saw that Bill Simmons trajectory over the page two days and I'm and he did it differently than everybody else and I was like why can't I do that right and I I'm not gonna post 20 times a day I'm just gonna do like one Epic article that everybody gets excited about and that was kind of my Mo and it's funny because that eventually became the meta kind of the more Facebook era um in the early 2010s uh so I was like ahead of the curve I guess on the marketing side I was trash I was just like selling does not come natural to me at all it was very much something that I had to consciously train myself practice I took a bunch of copywriting courses um I like went to marketing seminars pirated marketing seminars uh like that was always it's funny because it's like the the psychology side the personal development side of everything the social dynamics the relationship advice like that all came very easily and naturally to me yeah and it was just it was fun it was like kind of a hobby so it was like I never really had to like work hard to kind of figure that out like anything I was working on getting better at in my business it was always the sales and marketing stuff right like figuring that [ __ ] out I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better [Music] so you've done uh so those content reps got in you obviously became a great writer and we'll talk about the book in a second but I want to talk about what you're doing now which is the YouTube video sure or the YouTube channel and yeah it seems like that's I don't know is that you're like it's not like the main thing is that like this is not my baby right now that's the new main thing yeah and so uh I think you dropped the first first like um video maybe a couple days ago and doing Super Bowl can you pull it up I want to actually do a little so one of my favorite little content things is this um this thing that happens in sports and football uh they like take quarterbacks that are about to be drafted and I don't know if you've ever seen they see they sit down they like look at game film with them just to see kind of how they think sure and um it's my favorite thing in any podcast is like when you can really like not like talking the abstract yeah talking the specific like like why did you do this yeah I think about this yeah um and we hung out with Mr Beast and we did that with some of his videos and the way he thinks he's like oh okay I get it I get like I learned something tactical but also just I get you more yeah um versus when you ask some general questions and so I kind of want to play this game I don't know how to work but we'll try I want to know the thought that went into this let's watch the first 10 seconds I wanna hear you talk about it okay what would you do if someone offered you ten thousand dollars to do whatever it takes to overcome your social anxiety could you do it would you even know where to start I decided to find out all right let's pause right there yeah yeah all right walk me through that well a lot was happening there what was how you think about this obviously some Mr Beast inspiration here he was very inspirational so let me zoom out for a second uh uh more broadly and then I can kind of come back to this video specifically so early in my career I did a lot of coaching first with the pickup stuff and then just kind of like life advice in general I stopped coaching for a lot of reasons but one of them is I was consistent I was very frustrated by it which was that I feel like the incent like the way the incentives are structured within coaching Industries uh in the personal development world are counterproductive right so it's like if you're paying me a bunch like let's say I don't know you have like self-esteem issues and you're paying me a bunch of money to like help you out it's first of all my incentive isn't to fix your self-esteem issues like my my incentive is to make it feel like I'm fixing your self-esteem issues even though they're still there like a pharmaceutical company right exactly assure you exactly and then on your side of the equation uh it's what often happens in practice like or on the customer side is what often happens in practice is people kind of show up they pay you say a thousand dollars and they're like well I just paid you a thousand dollars so you deal with it right like I've been dealing with this my whole life I just paid you a bunch of money you deal with it now right like that's actually what they're looking for and so I hated that Dynamic it felt very I mean it works some of the time but in a lot of cases it felt very icky and I've kind of found myself in like awkward situations with clients and stuff uh so I just got away from it uh entirely and just kind of stuck the books and courses and everything when I saw Mr Beast a light bulb went off I was like because I love Mr Beast and like I've been watching his [ __ ] for a long time but one of my frustrations with him is that it's all very surface level like I'll watch a Mr B's video and I'll get to the end and I'm like I want to know about the guys character yeah I'm like tell me about the guy we won or tell me like you're down to four people tell me about their lives like bring their families in like I want to see let's get some juicy drama going right I talked to him about this yeah and I was like uh because I was like he was talking about like a Netflix or like TV shows yeah and it was like oh like yeah what can you learn about TV show what do you learn from like TV shows that have been running for a long time do really well um and he he says he's like uh also I think they can learn a lot from us and he's like yeah he's like I'd love to see their retention curve um right they just don't know where people are dropping off he's like what we found was like if you hit him hit him hit him with like the more of like the action and the stakes and then the the quest and like the Curiosity you open the loop and like that's gonna keep people he's like but he's like but I do think the one thing TV does well is characteristic we don't do any narrative or character and I gotta figure out how I'm gonna do that yeah he's like I don't know how to do that yet but like we should probably learn that yeah so this is this is kind of another side statement and this gets more into like my personal strategy or like opportunities I see in the future but like it's the current media environment I think traditional media they've always had the luxury of having that lock-in of like you're in a theater and it's more it's like once you're in a theater it's more difficult to leave than to sit through a bad movie so everybody just sits through a bad movie you know it and it's and the previous era of Television it's you know you don't want to sit there and like flip around for 10 minutes looking for something else so you sit there and just kind of watch a mediocre show so it's like traditional media is coming from a hundred years of a luxury of just having that buy-in and having you like locked in and and so they can take the time it requires to build character build narrative build build build drama right and and create those very emotional moments that we've all had with our favorite movies and TV shows YouTube is kind of the other way around like there's always [ __ ] fighting for your attention and trying to get you to click off and so YouTube is just retention retention retention like it's merciless and absolutely brutal and so I think we're in an interesting media environment where YouTubers have become masters of retention and the content on YouTube is super hooky and click the rig right like those two two variables yes and super hooky very clickbaity like addictive but also kind of empty calories like you can just blow through like six videos and just be like wait what I don't remember a single thing I just watched and that's kind of unsatisfying traditional media is like caught in the other side of things of like wait [ __ ] like people are watching our shows now with like their phones in front of them and they're like they've now got five different streaming services they can pick from and they can switch easily switch to another movie like mid-movie right and so they're trying to catch up on the retention side of things and I think YouTube is trying to catch up on the the character development and drama side of things and I think whoever figures it out first is gonna like win really big but anyway back to the Mr Beast thing and the coaching thing so I was watching Mr Beast videos for a couple years and then like last year I was I was kind of taking this break and I was trying to figure out what I was going to do next in my own career and I had felt this about his videos for a long time and and I started thinking I'm like man like what if you what if you built the challenges in a way that like forced character development like what are the challenges weren't built around like you know stand in a circle or uh you know keep your hand on a car like what if it was built around on this Lamborghini yeah like what if it was built around like a real personal issue that like you have to investigate to like try to understand right and and that's when the light bulb went off because I'm like not only does that potentially create like very amazing transformative YouTube content but it solves that coaching issue as well because when you take somebody who's struggled their entire life with say anxiety or an issue the problem is never that this comes back to the information thing the problem is never I don't have the information to fix my problem the problem is they're just not doing it right like they're not [ __ ] going out and doing it and so and they could pay a coach a thousand bucks and the coach can say okay well you paid me a thousand bucks now go do it and sometimes that works but not always or you could say I'll give you a thousand bucks if you go to it and fix your own [ __ ] right like what does that look like right like what is like the most effective lever for Behavior change is financial incentive and so what if you actually create Financial incentive for people to actually go deal with their [ __ ] and like do the things that they've always known that they need to do and they've just never had the guts to do it and so that's when I was like holy that's kind of Genius yeah I was like [ __ ] I need to make this uh so this is our first attempt at it and it's funny because this was shot end of April early may this is we're recording this end of July um there are like I'm already aware of like 15 things that are wrong with this video and like they're like it's it's actually underperforming our expectations and like there's so many things that we need to fix but it's your first rep yeah it's the first rep it's like the first it's like the beta test but super super excited about the format that makes a ton of sense and uh also like even just mechanically like the things you just said so if you know coaching is getting somebody to like transform uh the way the Transformers not information just doing it yeah best way to get somebody to do is if maybe a financial incentive or even like the fact that they agree to be in the content there's a contract there to like do the thing um but you also how can you offer ten thousand dollars to why could you pay your clothes that's not a sustainable business but it is if it's YouTube content you have like almost the full loop to be able to make something it creates it creates a very beautiful flywheel of you're helping that individual so in this video it's a woman named Melinda so I'm helping Melinda and she did get amazing results uh you know she's finally doing the things that she's always known that she should do or has always wanted to do you get to all the people watching because I could easily make a video of me sitting at a desk talking about social anxiety for 15 minutes everybody's heard the same [ __ ] they've all like everybody knows what I'm gonna say now millions of people get to actually watch somebody overcome their character overcomes yeah it's like oh that's what it looks like oh that's what how people respond in that situation you know the difference between watching Rocky and then some or somebody sitting in a chair and saying you just gotta work really hard yeah yeah it's a different emotional register and a lot of people remember 20 years later and still think about when you work out yeah and the other one you don't totally so it's the qualitative feedback on this it's been honestly it's been some of the best of my entire like we if you look through the comments of this video there's tons of comments of people saying I cried right this was me oh my God like I was not expecting this this is so powerful you know it it's pretty incredible and so how did you think about those first 10 15 seconds I don't know how long we went but like what are you trying to achieve in those first 15 seconds of this video so that with YouTube content there's always this question of like what's the hook like what's going to get people to buy in what's going to get people to stick around and one of the challenges that we face with this format is that all of the all the stuff that we're having people do it's it's super abstract like social social anxiety is super abstract like how do you show social anxiety it's like not very obvious how you show that visually uh or like low self-esteem how do you show that visually so we were thinking about like okay what are like kind of like hooks or gimmicks that we can like Implement into the format that can get people bought in right and the first and most obvious in this in the current Mr Beast briefcase is [ __ ] money right it's like everybody on YouTube's doing it it seems to be working for a lot of people so kind of the obvious starting point is like okay well what are we Jedi right Jedi in the nums yes what if you gave him ten thousand dollars but the funny thing is is that it actually this intro did not perform very well yeah and so what is that what tells you that like you're looking at the curve you're like the retention chart what should it have been yeah for what do you think it should have been to be like good well I think though the issue with this is that even though it's money it's still it's still not visual enough it's still too abstract and so I think what we've learned from this one is that the new approach needs to be we just need to start like mid challenge so like the first challenge in this video is just approach we yeah we take her into a mall and we tell her she has to find somebody from Canada and like she by the way it's so funny because she it's it's so like relatable this is why I think you should have started with this I was actually gonna suggest this yeah it's so related because you tell her like someone in this mall is from Canada you need to go approach them and ask them and find them and she's like nervous laugh and then she starts like faking being on a phone yeah like which is everybody's done it like and then she's like it's like are you faking a phone it's like yeah I am I just I don't know it makes me feel more comfortable dude she was so relatable such a spaz right such a spaz it was really fun and and yeah in hindsight it's like we should have just opened up with that and then explain the format later yeah uh but like yeah I mean we're new we're we're Paving the road as we drive so cast yes which is hard and you don't know what's gonna happen and like this is kind of reality TV for sure and there's also like how this I would say this is a common theme from the pickup to uh subtle art to now this which is how do you avoid selling out so like yeah when you've been in the the industry you kind of know okay if I pull this lever I'm gonna get more juice yep like maybe maybe this will let's just pretend If This Woman's transformation was not that that crazy but like in the edit you could kind of like oh for sure make this video better it's like do we want to have our video be better or worse obviously better but at the same time we don't want to sell out how have you just dealt with that like how hard do I want to turn the knob or pull the lever of like you know manipulation to make something work the few that we've shot all of them have been very successful so far but I've told the team that I want to be eventually we're going to hit one that's not successful like we don't help the person it doesn't work right or maybe we help them a little but they don't get there right uh I think it's very very important to be honest about that and to actually make a video like have the video kind of explore why that is right you know um because it's yeah there's a credibility and authenticity that it's just so so important especially and that's it's been one of my criticisms of my own industry for 10 15 years of just like the lack of trustworthiness the lack of credibility because if you promise the magic pill that works in two minutes you're gonna sell more and if you say this takes you two years of tough work right right so you've probably dealt with that a bunch and like maybe now you know you got [ __ ] you money from the book and you're like no I don't have to do that anymore you know I guess how's that changed well I'm very fortunate in that the book did well first of all it is true the book did so well that I do have [ __ ] you money so I don't really care like this is this YouTube Project's losing money and it's probably gonna lose money for a year or two and all right fine with that uh but like it's I'm also very fortunate that I made my money being very explicit about that that like there is no magic pill there is no cure-all like it's funny dude like even when you dig into research on uh therapies like what modality of therapy is the most effective right you start looking at the research and it's it's startling because there's nothing that has more than a 50 hit rate nothing like not there's no form of therapy that is successful like produces positive outcomes more than 50 percent of the time which is crazy because it's like therapy is like the most tried and true like we've had it for 200 years like it's the one thing everybody's like is directed to go to so there's in the world of psychology there's just so much that we don't know what works like in what works for you could completely fail for me and vice versa because everybody's so individual so to your point about casting a huge part of our casting process is doing pre-shoot interviews me doing pre-shoot conversations and interviews with the person to really gauge of like is this a person I can help because for every video we shot we talked to probably two or three people and half of those people I'm like you know not really confident I can actually like right get them over the line whereas like with this with this woman you know I talk to her in within 10 minutes I'm like yeah right now I could give me a week with her I'm like I could get I can get something out of it you know did you um do you watch the TV show The Bear by any chance I have not everybody says It's amazing but I'm not yet yeah it's actually it's a little bit I would say it's a little bit slow but it pays off it's the thing you talked about which is like the retention curve for me was terrible at the beginning because it's slow it's like it's like one of those like cool shows where it's like you know we're not gonna like be clickbaity yeah and I'm like I'm kind of used to that hit so you know like if you're really gonna pay this off with character it's gonna take some time but man it does there's like a episode in the second season it's like such a huge payoff on character that like now I'm like telling everybody you gotta watch the show just get into the second season get to the end of it yeah you know it's so so satisfying but they're um but we so we reached out to one of the writers and we were like hey there's respect and uh just we like to learn from people like that like how do you do this how do you do this character thing um have you learned anything in the process of like doing these videos of like because it's new it's not writing it's not books you now have like casting and characters and stuff you probably haven't done before like first of all I'm learning a million things one of the reasons I wanted to do this too I should specify is like you know I came out of this period the post subtle art period of my career I did three books back to back to back I did a movie like a bunch of traditional media success like everything was wildly successful very busy lots of money I moved to LA I took it took a few months off and I was just like man I miss like the grindy Grassroots internet right stuff right and but what I also realized is like I miss being bad at something like I miss I miss just like throwing [ __ ] at a wall and being like did that work like no all right let's try this you know like and and in traditional media I don't you don't really have the flexibility to do that like you're you're being if a studio or a large publisher is bringing you in it's because like they know you can make a hit and you need to make a [ __ ] hit and so I I miss the internet days of like all right let's try 10 things and just know that like six are gonna fail and uh like that's just exciting to me and so part of this project was like I want to learn I want to get back on a learning curve and like experience that again and so yeah I've been learning a million things about video production about um storytelling visual storytelling in particular like one of the big lessons from this video is that I still very much just write like a book writer like a lot of the mistakes that were made in this video it's because it was organized in such a way that would work really well on like an article or a book right but it works terribly on video what's an example so an example is for is like the intro right it's like that's a great intro on paper it's a terrible intro on video because it's abstract it's not visually interesting you know it's like you start with the challenge right this woman spaz running around a mall like ask people if they're from Canada like that's super weird and you're like what what's going on and then it's like you slowly like drip context over the course of like 10 minutes whereas when you're writing a book or or an article like you have you need to put all the context up front of like this is what we're doing this is what this is about you know it's like the old school essay it's like you gotta have your thesis in the first paragraph and then you got to have your three bullets and like all this stuff so I still my brain still kind of defaults to that and I'm having like untrained myself in a lot of ways the funny thing is is like and again one of the reasons I'm doing this is I think my natural strength is story and character and narrative like that that's where I shine naturally what I'm weaker at is the retention the hooks the like uh gen Z [ __ ] the Gen Z [ __ ] yeah yeah actually yeah exactly there's something I've ever heard this term like the millennial pause no it's so funny it's like if you were to it's like what's up on your pause it's basically gen Z people if you watch the start of their video starts with them already they're already talking so they're like mid word oh yeah as the video starts whereas every Millennial is like they click record like hey everybody it's like that little like that little pause it's like you're already swiped on Tick Tock if you haven't like you got to be like mid interesting thing and I was like that's so [ __ ] true that's funny that's so true so you're doing this this uh series what's like the craziest or most interesting challenge I guess you can't give it away too much but like what what concepts are like oh I can't wait to see how that's gonna turn out or like I really want to try something like this a lot of the the social stuff is like the most interesting because it's you can do a lot of fear-based stuff I mean you can take somebody up in a plane and throw them out you know make them Skydive or whatever and that's exciting but like I don't know it it doesn't feel like there's as much depth as like the social stuff so uh we have a challenge in another video where I printed out Flat Earth Flyers saying like you know do you do you know the truth about the planet you know it's a picture of a flat Earth and I made her go into a public place and hand them out to people right and like try to convince them to be flat earthers and choose it's like absolutely mortified like just horrified and uh but it's super fun because then it's like well why do you care like you don't know these people you're never gonna see them again like why do you care why is it so horrifying right like it's just yeah it's super exciting for me this is honestly it's the most fun I'm having in my career and probably six or seven years which is a dope lesson because you know you wrote a book with Will Smith yeah a movie or you know you got to do a bunch of things that like I would say are like the on paper like the hashtag goals people think they want and uh like actually that's not where the source of joy and happiness comes from yeah I think you I think you had said something which was like happiness is from solving problems yep is that is that you yeah which is when you start at the beginning of a learning curve you're just gonna suck and solve a bunch of problems to make something good yeah and that's a lot more satisfying than uh for me at least it is you know I'm sure there are people out there who prefer like kind of a traditional media environment but one of the things I learned is that I can do traditional media projects and I can do very well at them but like I don't feel that same passion with them as I do with stuff like this like I like owning my own stuff I like experimenting I like the creative process like having the complete creative freedom and then also owning it and then also getting the package it and also like controlling the brand around it like it's also part of I mean we can talk about this too but um it's it's funny like so when my movie came out and I did all the press for the movie every single journalist I talked to was like so are you gonna do another movie and like in my head I'm like [ __ ] no absolutely not I'm gonna go make a YouTube channel because it's like that was actually my lesson from making a movie was like I should ask I should just have a YouTube channel like this because the economics of the Creator economy are fundamentally better the distribution is Miles better you've like complete ownership there's complete creative freedom like I I just don't see how this doesn't end up ahead right in 10 years it's like hanging by like a Prestige thread it really is right I'm like oh yeah Status it really is and it's I'm sure I I don't think like Hollywood's gonna die but I I imagine it's going to be very similar to like kind of what's happened with like newspapers and Twitter of like there's still prestigious newspapers and they still kind of matter a little bit like it's still nice to like be in the New York Times or whatever but the real intellectual debate and substance and like the stuff that drives culture happens on Twitter and sub stack and has for years now right and it's like I think we're coming up on an inflection point that that's that's also going to happen in video and audio based media I think it's probably already happened with podcasts and it's about to happen with video as well where it's like yeah there's still going to be like Marvel movies and stuff and Netflix is gonna have its TV shows and it's gonna be very prestigious to be on those but like culture is going to be driven by like it probably within this decade creators they're gonna grow up for one uh and two the production value is going to get better the storytelling is going to get better and it's gonna it's gonna hit an inflection point where it starts driving culture and not the traditional media if it's not already I mean I think if you're under 25 it is already right fair enough I want to talk to you about titles because I think you're a title master um do you think you're good at titles apparently I am I guess I don't feel good at them but the book obviously has a good title and it started with the book came from a blog post correctly it wasn't intended to be like a book it was like yeah here's a blog post why'd you know to turn that one into a book by the way does it like did it hit in a different way or yeah that that is that one I mean I had a lot of Articles go viral over that period like 2012 to 2015 like I probably had 10 or 12 articles go super viral but that one just hit on like a whole another level like it was so I had already written probably half the book when that article came out and then when that article hit the way it did my agent was like hey uh I think you could uh change the title of the book yeah and you hadn't done a book and years right before that no I just done models right so you're uh you're you're but you're already thinking about a book and then it was like yep oh lean into this one yeah so there's this a little picture or diagram that's is that did you make that or um the one with the guy floating away on the balloons oh that was is that a from something what is this that was an old meme back in the day okay so good yeah yeah I love it and that's that's like as good as that midwit Meme it's like yes this image can become like yeah you know transformational it's funny yeah I haven't seen that that I used that used to be around everywhere back in like 2013 2014 and then it's I haven't seen it in a long time right there was also the original article also because back then a big part of packaging an article for like Facebook and Twitter was what image pops up yeah that when you share and so we we used to spend a lot of you know kind of similar like thumbnails on YouTube we used to spend a lot of time like looking for the right image for the share share image on on Facebook and uh I think the other thing that made that article work was I think on Reddit one day just randomly on Reddit I saw somebody had photoshopped a picture of a kitten in front of like a bomb exploding yeah it's huge yeah and so we pulled that and used that as like the share yeah the share the share image and it was just kind of this magical combo of content title image and it just like all works do you remember how you thought of that title so the subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] where does that come from oh you're sitting down are you just hammering out a bunch of possibilities or I back then I used to keep a list of article ideas like just kind of a running list of ideas that I would just add to like I'd have conversations with people and something would pop up and I just pull out my phone added to the list um and it came from it came from there was a heavy metal song uh from a band called Lamb of God data data song called the subtle art of murder and persuasion and um and at that time I had just done I think two different articles with [ __ ] the time like I I had just kind of discovered that if you put [ __ ] the title it would go further it would yeah everything would go further so I was like adding [ __ ] to all my titles or to a bunch of my my titles at the time and so I was just kind of on the lookout of like cool titles that you could add add [ __ ] into um and I think I knew I wanted to do an article about not giving a [ __ ] uh because I was just an obvious topic uh and so when I heard that song I was like well subtle are not even like that's pretty damn good like I should use that let's pull up some of your other ones so you have uh the most important question of your life yep that's good that was a huge one because you gotta know I need to know yeah what is this jackass think you know it's like probably nothing but let me just check yeah the most important x uh like it's it's always gonna work you have uh life is a video game and here are the cheat codes yeah it's like a you know Master path that that's become uh I feel like that's become a it's so this is the other thing like I think a lot of I guess my skill with this just came from cranking out articles in the Facebook era of like trying to get articles to go viral because it was like so much of it had to do with the title and it's been interesting you know now it's been 10 years it's been interesting because some of these have kind of just become I guess classic yeah yeah like it's you just see there's probably 10 different brands that use these same titles all the time and like the life is a video game one is like I see that everywhere I wrote This Thread about um that the first line of it was everybody everybody seems to think Clubhouse is the next big thing yeah um but I think it's gonna fail and it's like uh grab some popcorn here's here's how I think it goes down yeah yeah and um that thing went crazy viral and like uh I like my hero Malcolm gladwells are following me Bill Simmons DMS me it's like oh [ __ ] this is like this is amazing I didn't know this could happen because like today the Facebook meta doesn't really work but like Twitter threads actually for a period of time last recently could could go viral and uh and now that same theme is like people just like AI is the next big thing but here's a you know he grab some popcorn here's how I think it goes down it's like a good copy paste but it obviously like loses effect of course as it goes that's the other interesting thing too that's kind of changed in the last 10 years like there was real and I I don't have any moral judgment around this but it's you know 10 years ago it was very much a sense of like if you came up with a title that like like a banger it was like that was yours right yeah you know it's like No And if somebody stole it it was like they're a piece of [ __ ] and then you call them out and your audience would call them out and like I used to get emails from fans being like this guy copied your article I'm like all this stuff like I never get those emails anymore like it's everybody just rips everybody off now and so anybody who posts anything that goes viral anywhere there's like the next day there's Half-Life there's 20 more versions on every platform and it's just like it's the way the game's played today it's that Meme that it's like you know I made this thing and then it's like they're like I made this I made this yeah yeah I don't think people even are aware of it anymore yeah um is blogging dead I think it it depends on how you define dead so there was an ERA in the early 2010s where a you a Blog could gain reach Beyond its own specific Niche like it you could kind of get mainstream audience like hit hit like a critical mass I think today you can still make a living off a Blog it's just you've got to have your Niche figured out you gotta like really be tuned into them and you're probably never going to scale an audience past like low six figures um whereas ten years ago I mean I think at my Peak I was getting like two two and a half million visitors a month that's right so it's it's a it's a different world now it is still possible but it's like I think it really only If You're Gonna Go blog route instead of podcaster video like it it you have to have a really good reason and it probably has to be a very specific Niche to do it did you podcast or do you podcast I do not is there like a reason or Why didn't I never started one just because of lack of bandwidth uh just like writing too many books um and then but now that I'm doing the video stuff like I'm probably gonna do something in the podcasting space it won't be something like this like last thing the world needs is another interview podcast don't step on my turf yeah yeah right I made this I made this this is mine yeah but um I do think it's I think it I would like to be in this medium in some shape or form so right uh you did a book with Will Smith and presumably spent a bunch of time with Will Smith yep you know when people meet celebrities I always ask like what do they like yeah it's not like I know it's just a real specific question it's kind of like that's what everyone how are they yeah everybody is like how are they as a person yeah it's kind of like you know like are they big are they awesome there's like that version of it but to me I'm sort of like what was this what was something you saw them do or like something you witnessed that was like just not how the common person would have approached a given situation so the quick answer to the the one everybody always asks which is like what's he like in person he is exactly like the Fresh Prince like that is I spent the I remember spending one day with him and then I went back to the hotel and and called my wife and I was like he did not act on that show like I said they literally just put him in a room and then put actors around the front like that is that is his personality will will is like there are a few Dimensions that I think he is like at the extreme end of the bell curve the the most obvious one that's not going to surprise anybody is just this Charisma like he is by far the most naturally charismatic bird I mean it can literally just be like me and him sitting in a kitchen at midnight talking about cartoon like he's so charismatic just like built into him and so it's not hard you spend a little bit of time with him and it's not hard to see and understand like oh okay I see why this guy's so famous his mind is is very almost delusionally positive like he kind of has this like you know we all have a little bit of a the psychologist Dan Gilbert calls it a psychological immune system which is like when bad things happen we kind of like rationalize or explain them in a way that you know makes us feel better or helps us his psychological immune system like it's just negativity just bounces right off him any sort of failure setback like he doesn't doesn't bum him out like I I've never really been around somebody who is so easily to like able to construe challenges and obstacles in a way that that is confident and beneficial like it's actually very impressive but it's funny because it also gets him in trouble like when there actually is a problem that needs to be addressed and you do need to be sad and you do need to like deal with it he just rationalizes it in such a positive way so quickly that it kind of like it can cause problems for him and that's that's actually one thing he and I talked about for the book is that you know he came from a very chaotic and like abusive childhood and he said he's like I developed that as like a survival mechanism and it's helped me so much throughout my life and my career like I'm just absolutely Relentless like anything goes wrong it never bothers me like I just get up and do it again but yeah it's like I'm a little bit untethered to reality sometimes uh so that that's like that was very interesting and and remarkable when you saw the Chris Rock slap or whatever that's obviously kind of like not like you know Mr positive or whatever in that moment were you like yeah what was your kind of were you like stunned uh like because you know him more than like everybody's shocked because it's a shocking thing yeah when you know the person you might have like either it's even more shocking than that or it's less because you understood it maybe it was coming from it was definitely less shocking for me um he slapped you once or twice yeah you're like yeah it's common keep her name out of your mouth uh no I mean like one of the things and we this is in the book he had a very abusive alcoholic father used to beat the [ __ ] out of his mom and he was the oldest he was the oldest child he was the male right so he felt responsible and very protective and so he has a lot of issues around women he's very protective he's very sensitive like the women in his life are his Achilles heel like that's if you want to get to him like that's the route like you can talk [ __ ] about him all day all night he's gonna sit there and laugh he fine whatever it's like you go after his mom his daughter or his wife like shit's gonna get real real fast and so I wasn't surprised it was funny actually I was watching it with my wife live and like my wife turned to me and she was like this is a bit right I was like no but that's not a bit like he's actually saying that right now she's like what she sent him a text afterwards or you like just give him space because the Uber famous people you like it's hard to even navigate it's like you don't want to be one of those people yeah girls like if I'm your friend do I just send you something like yeah it's weird that's a whole like we could spend an hour just talking about that that's like super weird it's funny too because it's like everybody who I've ever known in my life message me that night asking for like my opinion whatever and I'm like literally people like I haven't talked to since high school you know are like reaching out I'm like wait this is the thing that got you to reach out like all the [ __ ] I did you didn't like didn't bother like you know couldn't be bothered to say anything but like this this got you to reach out to me all right all right yeah that that was just I mean it like something can win the internet for the day and like yeah on the internet it has like insane reach it was insane yeah amazing thanks for doing this by the way I know you uh you know you kind of didn't know what you're gonna do I hope you enjoyed it have you had a fun time yeah I definitely did because you're somebody I followed for a long time and I think the people I respect the most like some people respect like Elon Musk the most some people respect because it's like oh he conquers like you know taking us to another planet yeah uh but I always admire thinkers like I think uh a great thinker somebody who's who puts out original thoughts and I don't know makes you think about the world a little differently those are my favorite types of people so I really appreciate you coming on thanks dude I'm glad glad we did it absolutely man where do you want people to go the YouTube channel I'm assuming is check out the YouTube channel there's gonna be more of those videos coming out Mark Manson what is that yeah if you just search Mark Manson on Youtube it'll it'll pop up and then uh parkmanson.net got a newsletter there um and I think that's you know buy the books whatever I don't give a [ __ ] yeah I don't give a [ __ ] buy my [ __ ] awesome cool that's right all

that's like eight hundred thousand dollars of recurring Revenue if I get two and a half percent that's two million if I do five percent that's four million and if you just think about what would I pay for a business that makes me that much money a year like this is like five ten fifteen million dollars of value and so I'm looking at it and going this is great I'd pay for what I'm getting [Music] all right what's going on everyone we have Andrew Wilkinson on the Pod today Andrew's one of our great great friends he runs this company called tiny which is publicly traded in Canada it's a holding company that owns like 40 different companies I think it's publicly traded at like a 800 million dollar market cap something like that does 150-ish in a year in Revenue so he's got a really good insight and we talked to him about a few interesting things one thing that sounds kind of like not that cool but actually is cool is he hung out with a few folks that are worth like 10 or 20 billion dollars recently and he like talked about what it's like hanging out with people uh in that sphere uh we talked about meta lab which was his agency that he started which provided all the profits in order to start tiny and how it makes something like 20 million dollars a year in profit and we just said how the hell does it make so much money and what did you guys do so he gives us a breakdown on that uh we also asked them which agency he would start now we asked him all about his new Twitter experience so why would somebody who is worth all this money run a Twitter experiment that makes 10 or 20 grand a month in sales and he gives it's a low down on how much money his uh that little experiment's making and then we asked him about when you take dividends from a company like what do you actually do with the dividends and where do you invest them or how much do you pay yourself and he got really transparent about that and so it was really interesting so check it out this is Andrew Wilkinson it's Sean and me Sam so if you guys like it subscribe on YouTube subscribe on your Spotify subscribe on wherever podcasts are and uh let us know if you liked it see you soon I was uh before you got on channels make it for the badger he looks like Kevin McAllister's mom in Home Alone mom mom he looks like he uh he looks like he's uh just taking up rollerblading in the night in the 90s you're saying I look like Catherine O'Hara well look at her character in The Home Alone she had a massive wave it was cool you're like a bully in a movie I think you look good I think it's cool it's okay man she was hot she was hot it's all right um well welcome back there's no podcast on Earth where you will just be welcomed with open insults like my first million yeah this is great you guys want to roast me for another 10 minutes uh yeah I was I was supposed to come on what like three weeks ago and then I got strep throat and dude I haven't been that sick in years I was like on death's door for a year I ended up taking like three different antibiotics so I'm I'm glad to be alive and you're on a health kick now you've been lifting weights yeah yeah I'm doing a muscle gain competition with a bunch of friends so that's been really fun Sean says he's Sean has like I think 40 days left to have abs how many days do you have left I'm just I say I'm perpetually eight weeks away from having exactly the body I want the problem is it's a this clock restarts every time um doordash you know Domino's or Taco Bell or something like that so have you tried just doing a zenpic because like I I have so many friends that are taking that and it's just like they're suddenly ripped yeah there's it just doesn't have it doesn't do it for me Sean's very anti like are you would you are you are you a vaccine are you an anti-vaccine guy too no but I do think that uh the covered vaccine was not a vaccine because I was like wait a minute so you still get it you still spread it all right well I that doesn't sound like Mexican to me you're like anti-putting stuff in your body it seems I don't drink caffeine I don't uh take like I guess I take some supplements like I'll take uh protein powder or whatever but uh yeah I try not to be dependent on anything and you know the weight loss thing for me I'm already married I got two kids I don't really care to lose weight uh aside from conquering my mind and doing something that I wanted to do so if I took ozempic to do it it would not uh be satisfying in the way that it will be when I just do it myself yeah I've just always told myself at one point in my life I want to look like Wolverine even if it's like for one week and then it's over and it's unsustainable or whatever I just want to get there I want to have the photo to prove it um so that's my goal for the next year or you should do the um the Jesse itzler living with a seal thing I feel like that's uh in play for you why aren't you doing that that sounds so freaking miserable that was the David Goggins thing yeah did you read that with them no I just remember you guys had them on you gotta you gotta read that book it's pretty good it's a fun it's a fun it's called living living with and seal or something living with seal he writes it almost like a diary so it's just sort of like you know it's not like a long book with like a bunch of Flowery language it's very simple um and you know it's like any David Geiger gets you motivated but this is like secondhand Gaga you don't even realize the guy is David Goggins because he doesn't say it in the book and you're reading the perspective not of David Goggins telling you that you're soft and you need to be hard but like a guy who was kind of soft getting yelled at by David goggin so you're sort of secondhand at receiving the info have you guys seen the cover of this book it looks like you know remember like Ernest Goes to Camp it looks like the cover of like Ernest very outdated well we and we're having the guy Jesse on the Pod soon he's scheduled and I was thinking about it Sean we've asked our question of like who's like who has the ideal life he's up there man he's he's kind of nailed it well that's his thing the life resume what does he do so he just like has these experiments or whatever I know he went and lived with monks and he's done the Navy SEAL thing well before that he was like I think he like initially made a little bit of money by having like I think he had like a rap group and he like made songs for like the New York Knicks and he like that was his career was writing Jingles try to be a rapper was like all right maybe he can't be like rapper rapper but I could be like commercial jingle rapper hit it with that made a couple million bucks like sold the company for like four million dollars then he created the fractional jet share company uh Marquee Jets him and his buddy and then they sold that to netjets which Buffett owns and then uh he married the co-founder of Spanx um or the founder of Spain and she's like a billionaire yeah and then he also created like uh a coconut what's it called he bought uh coconut water is even coconut water zico ziko coconut water um early on and then help them sell to Coke so he basically just goes like kind of like Mission or passion uh to Passion but he's had like pretty good results like he owns a part of an NBA team he was like Oh I wanna I'm Into Fitness so he creates this running club he actually reminds me a little bit of you in that like I feel like you experiment uh like you like to experiment and you'll get into your experiments and the experiments almost start it's almost like oh why is Andrew doing this almost silly thing but it's because there's something in you that's like you've identified something that you're like right now Jesse it's like I love pickles and there's no great pickle company so he's like scouring the Earth to find the best pickle company to buy because he's like there's a big opportunity of pickles and he's like I can't believe you guys are all sleeping well there's a pickle opportunity like this and I just find it amazing how he's getting really into these like Niche passion Pursuits but then kind of pulls them off in an epic way I think I think it's really cool I mean I think we talked about him before but Nick Gray any of these people that build their life around the thing they actually love doing because I feel like so many of us were like okay I want to get rich I want to build a big business or whatever and so you get into doing something but you don't actually necessarily like a lot of those tasks you do or if you can build a business where your job is like to meet interesting people or be a podcaster and speak to really interesting people all the time time or do these crazy life experiments I think that's awesome but I think it's a double-edged sword I've made that mistake where I will get into a hobby or something like that and I'll turn it into a business and it will take the joy out of it so I think it's a little it's a little hard to find that that right uh in between spot well that's why I didn't want to do that Twitter thing because so you're doing Twitter subscribers you have like a community now I think you I don't know if you'll say the revenue or not but it's like actually kind of a business six figures a year in Revenue are you enjoying that you you told me you're doing it and I was like I don't want to do that that sounds hard yeah yeah well let me let me explain so yeah so I have about 240 000 Twitter followers I've never monetized it anyway I just you know I tweet every day and it's literally like I'm in the shower or I'm on the toilet and I think think of something and I tweeted out that's always been my life on Twitter um and it's been amazing like I've met tons of interesting people from it but the issue is and I know both you guys have this problem too you get endless reach outs from all these people constantly and for a while I had open DMS it was just overwhelming I was getting like 100 DMS from random people pitching me on like crypto scams and stuff but every like 25 people would be some incredible 22 year old who has this amazing cash flow business they want to sell me or they need money or something like that and so I had this incentive to go through it and I would spend like 30 minutes a day going through all these and triaging them and kind of hating my life and so when I saw this subscription thing I was like okay this is actually a filter so what Twitter lets you do is have um gated tweets so you can say anyone who pays to subscribe to me gets these extra tweets and so what I did is I was like okay if someone will spend 29 bucks which is the cost to basically buy me lunch then they can DM me then they can message me then I'll you know then I'll respond and so I used it as a filter but it kind of surprised me as I started doing the math um so basically what I did is I said okay 29 bucks I'll do an AMA once a month which you know I enjoy doing anyway video or writing just video like a big video group or whatever and then I made a telegram group and that's it and I said I won't even respond to the telegram group um you know that's it you got the AMA and my tweets or whatever but when you do the math like it's pretty crazy I have about 550 um paying subscribers today that's growing pretty consistently um that's about 16k of mrr so about 200k a year uh it's basically pure profit I probably spend an hour a month two hours a month doing the AMA or whatever and if you look at the math like a one percent conversion rate on 200 um what is it 240 000 people that's like eight hundred thousand dollars of recurring Revenue if I get two and a half percent that's two million if I do five percent that's four million and if you just think about what would I pay for a business that makes me that much money a year like this is like 5 10 15 million dollars of value and so I'm looking at it and going this is great I'd pay for what I'm getting I'm getting people being filtered out dinguses are filtered out um I'm making money and I'm actually getting deal flow so I've like higher I've literally hired two or three people from this I now go to this group and I'm like hey I need a CEO for this business or I want to buy a business like this and so it's been awesome um and yeah I'm loving it Sam do you pay to follow uh Andrew no I will I can just text him but I will I'm a dangerous I guess you're in the Dingus I'm a paying subscriber so I I are you of course all right I'll do it are you gonna do it Sean no I'm never gonna do this I paid literally to just figure out why the hell is Andrew doing this and then I my mind started going with conspiracies I texted Andrew can I share my conspiracy theory as to why yeah yeah okay so I assume I sent Andrew a voice note I go uh this is my logic you're way too rich to be doing this so there's got to be another reason I said why would why would Andrew start using all the paid features of tour these new paid features of X um why would he be doing these subscriber experiments and he's speaking so glowingly about how this is so cool how he's discovering his true fans how he's getting all this value out of it I was like this just doesn't add up it's too much work for too little money for this guy and so then I was like I know what he's doing I've seen Andrew do cool moves like this in the past where he uses he throws his weight around in order to meet the cool people he he likes and admires and wants to hang out with I said oh this is the long game because guess who really wants cool interesting people like Andrew using all the paid Twitter features in order to uh to to build a small business and and would love that they're telling the world how great this is Elon freaking musk and I thought oh this is genius actually Andrew is using this feature on blast he's the most legit guy who's doing this um with a unique use case and he's got a big following he's going to be the gold star example he's going to get a follow he might get a DM he might get invited he might get invited to come out to visit Andrew's going to end up friends with Elon Musk from this whole thing that's my prediction and so I I sent a voice note to Andrew like I cracked the case like I found you know whatever the shooter for JFK and I was like ah I know what you're doing you're trying to become friends with Elon and he's like no uh just like yeah right and I was like damn I almost wish that was the answer that would have been a better answer is that true I actually I have no and I I um I've invested in SpaceX quite a while ago and I have a ton of friends who are friends with Elon and know him and stuff I honestly I don't know what I would say to the guy right like I feel like he's like a super genius engineer like super kind of Asperger Z guy I don't there's a lot of people I would love to meet Elon I'd love to be at a dinner table with him but I actually don't I I don't know what I would say to him it's like meeting Thomas Edison like how am I interesting to this guy who would you like the most boring businesses uh I really want to meet Larry Ellison I've been trying to meet Larry Ellison for like probably two years and I went to Lanai and he owns the entire island of Lanai it's insane like everything he owns they're all the businesses all the hotels all the real estate and while I was there I was trying to find a mutual connection and he kept driving by me in here orange the guy the guy drives an orange Corvette and he just rips around Lanai and I just couldn't I couldn't meet him but anyway he's super fascinating dude it's so funny that from the outside so we'll do an intro to this because we just jumped into it but so Andrew you're in your mid are you maybe late 30s now 30s now and very very successful company uh in the ballpark of a billion dollars publicly traded and you still can't meet some people and so good looking it looks like the mom from home alone and we still can't get it done it's insane I claim to fame I want it to look like Wolverine and instead I look like the mom from home alone I didn't tell the story on the podcast yet but I went down to LA and um I I did a bunch of these like pod interviews that are gonna be coming out but I did some meetings that were not podcasts just like really interesting people but I didn't I didn't record I just wanted to go I went to their house I just wanted to meet them and see what they're like and uh one of the people so I can't say who one of the people they were showing me around their house is a famous successful person in La you know just uh use that General character and they said something really insightful they were talking about trying to um get something they're trying to get their kid into a school and like this is a person who's rich and famous it could kind of get anything they want but there's you know these schools in La there's private schools that like they're they get their thing is that they're like Harvard for kindergarten they like reject everybody and so they got rejected at the school and he's like he's just saying this he goes he goes I couldn't tell you that morning he's like I felt something that I hadn't felt in seven years rejection he's like nobody had told me no in seven years and I was like wow that's a kind of amazing that uh you know you sort of feel rejection and so anyway this is my my to your Larry Ellison point I think it's great that you have certain things that that didn't didn't work out or you got rejection because when we were in La we met Maybe 20 people during the week that we had meetings with and I would say a very common thing was so people were out of touch with rejection which was either one of two things they weren't trying enough new things so they're just in their comfort zone or everybody around them just said yes even to their bad ideas even to like request it didn't make sense and um you could see firsthand how that's not a great thing how you don't want to be in that position has I I don't know if you've been single and successful but Dan Bilzerian has this line I actually read the Dan Bilzerian book which is shockingly good and he's like being famous is so much better for meeting girls than being rich is like it's 10 times better to be famous than it is Rich have you found being successful has helped you with women or do they mostly not give a [ __ ] uh well I haven't been I haven't really been like single for a very long period of time it's definitely helped um but I mean I think It ultimately comes down to status in the room you're in right so like if you're in a club you know the DJ the guy who's making less than the bartender and is getting paid in drinks he's the man he's the guy that all the girls want to sleep with right so I think you know whatever room you're in and so you know if I was at like a like a business conference and a bunch of people knew who I was yeah maybe that would help me with women but when it comes to day to day I mean yeah you're way better off being like an Instagram influencer or something that girls actually care about um I think it helps though I mean it helps to have your your [ __ ] together for sure uh how do you play the status game if I had an experience recently where somebody I know I have to be really really vague about this somebody I know went to someone's house who is a billionaire that's also famous and that person um entertains a bunch of people during the Summers and has a bunch of people at their house at the same time all of those people are also rich and famous and the person I know was a regular person no you know not not like uh somebody would recognize or somebody who's been in People magazine or whatever and so they felt very intimidated in that social setting uh to the point where they're like you know I I'm just gonna go eat in my room because it's like I don't really wanna I feel like if I go here I have to engage I don't really know how to engage they're not gonna care about me they're really like talking themselves out of it and I think that's a very common situation I know because I've definitely felt that in a bunch of social settings I think there's probably more common than I realized I thought when it when I experienced it I thought this was something that was just happening in my head then as this person was telling me about it I realized okay this probably happens to a lot of people how do you guys deal with that like kind of social anxiety where you're in your own head about the status of the people in the room and how you fit in and where where you fit I've just realized that everybody wants to talk about themselves and it's the Dale Carnegie thing find out what someone likes to talk about and then talk to them about that and just keep asking questions and I realize that if they if I make them feel good if they get to talk about the thing that they're interested in they will leave that experience thinking of me as a very positive person regardless of status have you read that book Sean do you know what he's talking about yeah I I have yeah there's like a famous story where this like young guy is hanging out with this like rich guy who has the power and the young guy just asks questions for 90 minutes of the 100 minutes and at the last 10 minutes the rich guy finally like asked him just a little bit and the rich guy leaves conversation being like that was the best conversation I've ever had that person sure is great and the other you know the nobody was like dude I barely said anything that literally happens to Ben Ben the business partner all the time he'll come back from a meeting and I'm like how'd it go he's like yeah it's great guys you know I ask a bunch of questions uh you know he's like he literally I really didn't tell him anything I didn't say anything he didn't really ask me too much he's like uh I just asked him so many questions that I was interested in about him he's like at the end of it the guy stood up I was like man this is one of the best conversations ever I really like you and I was like you did it again like you know he is that he's like the walking version of that book and you leave and you're like you know nothing about me you didn't ask any questions and I think it's great if the person is really fascinating what the status stuff though where I get annoyed is um so I remember I was at a conference uh probably like 13 years ago and at this point my business is making you know a couple million bucks a year uh in profit you know it's pretty successful and I sit down at this table next to this VC and he seems very disinterested and you know then he says what is what does your startup do and I say well I don't have a startup I have a business and it's profitable and he literally just goes oh a lifestyle business and it turns his back you just literally just turns his belt away from me and just starts talking to the guy next to him and I remember who it is I will one day there's gonna be like a comeuppance moment but I always think about that and then the other thing that happened to me recently um so I was on this yacht I'll tell you guys about that later if you want do it now okay so so basically um I got I got invited to go on like 100 million dollar plus uh yacht which I was actually really really excited about um just always been curious like it's this bizarre thing that you know you really don't get to see very often um and so I thought I'd love it but I actually found it incredibly odd um it's something that I feel like is very desirable because others desire it and we all have this idea of it but in reality I just don't get it like you spend this insane amount of money to be isolated in a floating Hotel away from all the plebs basically right what was the what was the net worth of the guy in order to have a hundred million yeah you're worth like five or ten billion 20 billion plus like very very very wealthy guy um I won't I won't say who but someone who's like a subscriber of yours on Twitter let's just say somebody yeah that's right exactly um but you know you know like you do you ever like you ever have that feeling of like um you know you're on this you're on this like floating Hotel it's shaking rattling it's swaying lightly which is like in my opinion not not nice and then you like have you ever been like on a really really nice RV like you go on one of those bus RVs and you're like holy crap I can't believe this RV has like the shower I can't believe it has like a king-sized bed but at the end of the day it's an RV king size bed it's not as nice as being in a hotel and I felt like that's the rich person equivalent right like everything on this boat is amazing but it's not as nice as staying in a Four Seasons and it's a hundred times the cost and you've got this thing that costs you 10 to 20 million dollars a year to maintain no way really 30 staff for 10 people literally this whole boat just has 10 guests on it right it's just crazy but anyway while I'm on this yacht whole bunch of people there and there's this guy who runs a publicly traded company and um you know I'm doing my thing I'm asking questions and chatting with everyone and he kind of like um he's kind of the serious guy he seems very unimpressed by me and he goes oh so what's your business and I say oh I've got a you know holding company and he goes oh is it public and I say yes it's public and he goes how big is it and I go uh I don't know trading at like 800 million today and he goes oh okay and his is like 10 billion he's like oh lifestyle business he's haunting you yeah exactly it was like that same feeling right and it's like I still get that same irritating feeling and I just feel like I'm not gonna play I'm like opting out I just can't deal just lifts up his legs it just walks away like dude soup's up that's that's the that's the weird thing with the status game right is like there's no end of it there's no end like the build I remember I was talking to a guy who's a um multi-billionaire and he goes oh my god um you know Laureen Powell job Steve Jobs Widow she's so [ __ ] Rich she's worth like 20 billion and I look at him and I'm like what can you not do that she can and he kind of goes glassy-eyed and he's like super yacht I can't do a super yacht yet and it's just like that is the most pathetic insane thing but you're yet you're falling into that trap as am I and I'm sure Sean is as well where you know I'm not a billionaire but I'm sure someone looked at what you know maybe what I have and they go why would you want more and in my head I'm like of course I want more and I'm angry at myself for wanting that but it's never enough yeah it's like leaving a party and you go to the and you move to the next room and then they put you back at the kids table and you're like God I just want to be at the adults table right now and I just keep ending up at a kid's table no matter what level I get to we were at an event that was um a basketball related event and um I've said this before Ben has like some facial recognition software or something like that because he's like that guy over there is the minority owner of this NBA team I'm like dude how do you even recognize the minority owners of these teams like that I don't even know who these people are you see them at an event you're like that's him he's standing alone he's talking to nobody and um so we walk over we're like oh let's introduce ourselves walk over and uh introduce ourselves hey what's going on uh I'm sorry what brings you here you know whatever something like that so he we kind of approach him from the side he turns he's got two airpods in I was like all right double airpod all right nope that's okay he'll surely take one out he looks at us we say the first line he kind of just looks at us like are you gonna leave or is there more oh there's more okay I see him he takes out his phone and he just slides the volume slider down halfway and I'm like oh [ __ ] he's still got he didn't even pause he's just temporarily gave us like some airspace and we and we we actually know a little again because Ben knows this guy he's like oh yeah he he's really into this and he's his business was doing this so I'm like asking him about his thing for a second and you know this guy if there was a cologne called leave me the [ __ ] alone he would have been spraying it all over us in that moment it was just so obvious what this guy did not want to talk to us so fair enough uh we walk away next day uh we see a picture of him like on it on Instagram or something like that he's smiling and we I texted our friend who approached it with us and I was like oh this somebody snapped a picture of him when we walked away like that's him smiling so bright uh you know as that interaction was over but I feel like it's like um you know you have to experience these things so that you won't do it to others right and I always wonder like what's the moment where I kind of did that to somebody now like I I never want to become that show me where I'm going to die so I don't go there I want to ask you I want to ask you a question that's unrelated I think Sean put this here it's actually his last question and I just read it and it's the same question of I I have had and we could see this now that um you guys are public so Andrew's company is publicly traded tiny.com you could slash investors you can find all the good stuff I think you guys even did your annual meeting was a podcast which was cool Sean has this question how the [ __ ] does meta lab make so much money and that is a similar question that I have um it's astounding how how your your services part of tiny does so well which I think is it's I don't know where the exact numbers you can clarify but it's something in the range of Chinese making 50 or 60 million dollars a year um with really healthy margins which is just a very big agency so yeah that's the question Andrew how the [ __ ] does meta lab make so much money yeah I mean agencies can be incredibly profitable and um they're incredibly hard and I think that when you do it for almost 20 years and you have a niche so for example um with matalab and we own you know the numbers you're seeing are the Blended collection of I think six or seven different agencies what's the public number I thought it was like 60 or 70. yeah I don't know I mean this is one of the downsides of being public right I don't want to say some number and have it be wrong and then sure you know whatever but but you know anyone can go look at the filings and see um but for the group of those agencies um you know they can be incredibly profitable um if you find a really really good Niche and the nice thing with metal lab is that um you know we basically own product design and building like MVPs for startups and stuff in 2007 and we worked at it for a really long time and so when you have that reputation people will pay up to get you right and there's really not that many people that do it and do it well and have the capabilities we do so you can charge a premium uh and have really healthy margins now that goes up and down depending on what's going on in the market depending on how much uh you know how hard it is to hire a designer and developer that kind of thing and the problem with an agency is that it's the most variable business in the world so you know they're wonderful they produce a lot of cash flow but for the last 20 years we we've actually been aggressively diversifying away from agencies and the agencies have just been The Little Engine That Could they just keep on growing and growing and growing we didn't ever expect that metallab would get to the scale it's at and um you know it's been like an amazing surprise Sean and I were just sitting the exact same way yeah I know I had to stop myself because I was like oh man we're both like little Shirley Temple right when I saw that I was like I'll let him go first but I know that there's so many things here that we're good well simple question does better lab get most of its or like how many sales people does metalab employ or people that like their core thing is to go sell medalab as a service to other people bring in new accounts bring in business well so we they don't really do a lot of outbound um so it's mostly mostly inbound demand and again that's another reason why the businesses the agencies in general have been profitable like we've basically focused on reputation and organic whereas a lot of the big agencies and people that have much lower margins so like a typical agency will have 20 margins 15 margins even five percent margins if it's poorly run often they have to have a whole bunch of people out there cold calling and selling we don't have that problem to the same degree people come to us and want to work with us so I think the sales team is maybe six or seven people or something like that um the whole company is about 150 or something you have had a bunch of agencies you've had meta-lab which is product design was that I don't know that's how I would classify it um you've had a no code agency you have um a Content agency you have like a bunch of different agencies meta lab seems to be like the biggest winner by far like if it was like there's like a power law right inside your portfolio and and uh and metal lab is bigger it's been around for longer um is it because you started at the right time is it because you were there as the founder sweating it and grew it into something big is it because that Niche is better why is meta lab so much bigger why have these other agencies not had the same sort of uh scale that meta lab was able to achieve well we really only um started based so here's what happens so metalab was the Golden Goose that provided all the cash flow that we used to build tiny and buy all the other businesses and to be honest we really were kind of saying we don't want more agencies um you know we're happy to own that one uh we'll hold it forever but that's not an area we want to focus is that is that beam is that is that division called beam so here I'll just read it's called beam I'll read here this is from your 2000 this is from your one of the reports so founded in 2006 with zero dollars invested never raised a cent of equity in 2021 it did 62 million in Revenue with earnings of 21 million 20 uh sorry that was 21 2022 it did 81 million with about 20 million in in operating earnings so those are the the public numbers yeah so um so anyways so we have this problem so metal lab was getting to the point where they could only do projects for like 500 000 and so we had tons of leaves coming and we had nowhere to send them we would just say no um and so we went out and we acquired a small agency in Spain we spun up 80 20. we kind of basically said look we've got um we have a sawmill we've got all the sawdust coming out of the Sawmill all this demand we should go form this into wood pellets and sell it and so we basically created like a whole constellation of smaller agencies to service the leads from the big one and then all of those agencies have kind of moved out of the house now so they're not reliant on metal lab leads anymore to the same degree um and we've had some amazing successes while they're not as big most of those we started for 25 Grand maybe or up up to the biggest one we bought maybe for 500 Grand you know that business today does two or three million dollars of ebitda um so there we've had some really good win wins but I have this whole framework of like one plus one equals a hundred and you guys had Syed on yeah what'd you think about that last week I guess I loved it it was great and there's so much about the way that he thinks we've read all the same books um a lot a lot was very similar and I was nodding my head along but what he did with wpbeginner where he goes hey I've got this huge source of traffic I've got all these users that want to be told what plugins to use uh and then he can go and buy these plugins that have a customer acquisition problem they've built a great product they're built by developer they don't know how to Market it they don't know how to Source customers when you put those two things together you're basically buying this business on historical earnings but you know you can 10x it tomorrow um and to me that kind of reminds me of what we've done in the agency space we've said look we have you know 100 leads coming in every month that are you know things we can't serve us we might as well spin up all these agencies to make a bunch of money from those two and I love that model you told me that the revenue and the profit I mean it's almost 20 years old that the revenue profit in some years it's been very lumpy where like it went down a significant amount the next year right oh yeah it's it's a roller coat this is the thing is everybody that looks at these businesses goes wow these are incredible I'd love to own an agency the reality of an agency though is that it's a whole bunch of people their hair is always on fire they either have too little work or too much work they've either over hired or under hired and the margins can swing around a lot if you're not very disciplined so these are very hard businesses they're not they're not easy but they can be wonderful businesses from a cash flow perspective and certainly I mean Syed said as well but if I was you know if I lost everything and I didn't have my Twitter subscribers I would probably go start an agency like I think that is the easiest way to make 500 Grand a year very very simply that's changing with AI probably but what Niche agency would you do if you had to start over from scratch would take away all your money and all your all your audience well I would do design just because that's what I know but um you know that's that's my world right like that's where I started um but I don't know I don't know how that evolves over time Sean are you think about doing an agency me hell no do you know anything about me I'm looking to get rich the lazy way I'm not trying to do the hard stuff but you can do it this is what this is what drives me crazy is you guys have look at Nick Huber Nick Huber has 300 000 Twitter followers and he basically said okay um I get five different inquiries people message me asking for SEO they ask me for property appraisal they ask me for web design and they asked me for no one asked Nick for web design yeah yeah super clear sure sure in promotion Nick is one of my closest friends he's doing an SEO agency I'm like big do people ask you for SEO like I didn't but he's what he's doing what he's doing is smart right so he's a human router so he's got all these inquiries and then he's writing them and so like what Sean did so this whole framework of one plus one equals a hundred like Sean what you did with Shepard right you have this business it perfectly aligns with you you know the product all you have to do is talk about it a bunch and it will do well you haven't but that is a [ __ ] hard business that is an agency right that's a recruiting agency which is a brutal brutal comp kid business that's just been all abstracted away from you and you could do that you could abstract away a digital agency if you guys want to buy a piece to one of my digital agencies and just promote the [ __ ] out of it I will happily uh do a deal with you okay I will do that because you know it's easy for me to tell people that Shepard lets them hire talented people for 10x lower price than in the United States it's easy for me to tell people that that they should go to support Shepherd com and go do that that's not hard right it's not hard for me to tell people how much insane value there is and how I use that for my businesses easy stuff to do yeah and how would the yeah good plug uh and I feel like I feel like you guys are like uh you know when I hear you say this it's like you're looking at it and being like Oh a car wash like I don't want to get my hands like all wet and like I don't want to scrub the cars and it's like dude you just own the car wash yeah but you have to make sure that the product is good enough that you want to promote which does involve brain power and worry sure before before I'm sure Shepherd I tested every product that does that on the market I hired through each of them I hired multiple people through Shepard met with Marshall I was like okay here's a deal that makes a lot of sense and it's a it's at the right scale where it works versus these like agencies from zero I think are a lot harder but I will say the shepherd experiment has been so great that I can't wait to do the next Shepherd because it is it's the perfect thing right their revenue doubles my income goes up without the operational load customers get a good service that they you know that they they need and they want it anyways that's that is like so much easier than for example my econ my econ business is like your agency business like you know yesterday I'm looking at the inventory forecast oh we were way under then we were way over and we're just constantly going to get this wrong we have we need so many people to do all the operations for this because there's a physical product and you have to do photo shoots and you have to do everything to make this business work um and I'm like man this is hard mode compared to you know the easy mode of what the other side of things we're doing totally and that's the that's the thing I think like to a man with a hammer everything looks like a nail so it's like you guys would probably both start newsletters I'd start an agencies whatever you know and is easy but it's not the forever business like I have this whole thing about um you wanna you wanna before you launch your rocket you need a launch pad build the launch pad this is the launch pad business right it just provides you the ability to go and do the things you're really passionate about could you explain the the one plus one equals 100 did you say what that is yeah so well basically it's the idea of if you have an unfair Advantage so for Syed it was he has WP beginner the blog he has tons of people that are asking hey what WordPress plugins should I use and then if he buys a WordPress plugin which he can buy for incredibly cheaply he knows he can boost it so it's like a guaranteed return to me it's like um you know imagine if you own an airport and there's like 10 000 people in the lobby every day you know that you can sell them hot dogs a hot dog stand is not a good business but if you put a hot dog stand in the middle of an airport I can guarantee you're going to sell a lot of hot dogs there's a story after the Syed uh thing I I started reading about Warren Buffett who I had I knew nothing about and I've been texting Andrew I'm like oh I get why you did this like this sounds awesome you know of course it sounds awesome when it's from the best person who's ever done it but there's a story in the late 60s when he was maybe 35 and he goes to a movie theater and he goes boy it would be nice to own a little bit of all these ticket sales of all these people coming to this movie this seems like a wonderful business and then he goes you know there's this company called Disney that's doing this they even have a theme park let's go check it out Charlie and so they literally go to the theme park to like figure out and they talk to like the the attendance at the attendance at the rides and they're like how many people come in this thing and they're like that's how they're doing their research is they actually went went to the theme park and then he ends up buying five percent of Disney I think he paid four million dollars so it was worth uh you know not a lot of money back then and I knocked out the park and then there's another story about this guy he's like yeah Warren Buffett was supposed to be this wonderkin investor and we had all heard about him but I was in New York and I saw him walking around New York like pacing counting his paces and I asked him what he was doing he's like oh we're going to invest in some type of real estate deal and I wanted to figure out how many Paces it made up of this Square block so I can guess how many like people are going in it was like something crazy like that it was really funny where he would actually test these things he would look at the financials and that was the most important thing and then he would go like in real life and actually test these things to see like all right is this cool is this legit what's this all about and or he would like there's a story of him literally knocking on the door at Geico like hey can you get can someone talk to me about this company tell me what you guys do because the financials look great and like it was pretty funny how he did some of that stuff he was very Hands-On yeah Buffett I'm so glad that you're uh deep diving on Buffet it now because it is it is the way I think about it is it's business abstracted to the ultimate degree you think about this guy he's got 90 or 100 companies he's got 375 000 employees and he sits on his ass reading in Omaha every single day and I just look at that and I go how do I how do I do that and I don't know that sitting on your ass reading all day is the thing you want to do necessarily but how do you take enough of Buffett do you have the freedom to spend your time however I I always heard people say that so I was like oh I could read so I've been reading like Thriller novels and stuff like that I'm like I'm just like buff it I'm just like Tom Clancy and then I read it's biography and it's like oh he's reading annual reports all day [ __ ] that I thought I could just sit at home and read all day so I've been reading like history books I'm like I'm just like buff it and then I read this book on him and I'm like oh he's reading like textbooks like it's way different yeah Chris when Chris and I started tiny uh maybe eight or nine years ago we were like oh we were reading all the Buffett books and we're like okay this is what we're gonna do we're just gonna read annual reports all day we print out all these annual reports and I think we lasted like four hours it's so boring and it's these guys are like they're they're so all they want to do is read right like Charlie Munger he just reads all day I think Buffett said 500 pages a day that he would read it's crazy it's insane that's a book a day a 500 a day uh it's so boring I like I also try to do that when I went and looked at the edible reports and I'm like they're using the same words over and over again I don't even know what these words mean uh it's challenging uh you have some interesting topics on here I want to do them so um what is the give me these two cool businesses so cool business number one no story lost what is that yeah so this is really cool so have you guys heard of the business story worth yeah I'm a big fan of it yeah it's super smart started by this guy Nick Baum he him and I worked out of the same office when he was starting it so he was he he I was one of his first customers I love him yeah he's awesome he's living living it up on I think he's on Maui right now just living there and living the dream but basically um you buy it for like your parents or your grandparents your siblings or whatever uh I think it's like 99 bucks and all it does is it just sends like a drip campaign of questions and so it'll be like hey like tell me about your childhood uh what was a moment where you struggled in a job who is your first boss all these things that you've always been curious to know about your family and you can choose all the questions or whatever and then at the end of the year it compiles it into a book that you can then print and share with your family or whatever and I thought like wow this is an amazing idea so I go and I spend 200 bucks I buy it for my parents and of course my parents fill it out for like three weeks and then they just stop and I talked to my dad and he's like well it's a lot of writing you know a lot of time and so I I was a little annoyed but I was like whatever and then I met this guy actually locally here in Vancouver and he has this business called No story lost and it's like the VIP version of story worth and so what they do is you just say okay Dad look we're going to schedule like three zooms you're just gonna talk to these people and they basically have like biographers they interview your parents or your siblings or whatever and then they actually write a proper biography of them so I'm about to get this book um professionally written book about my Dad's life and I'm so excited to read it and my dad was just so much happier because he didn't he just had to talk and like my dad loves to talk so yeah it's a really neat little business I think it's like two grand or something versus 200. do you know how big the biggest business is I don't I don't think it's very big wait you met this guy he has a cool business and you didn't strap him down and waterboard him until he told you his annual revenue I actually I invest I think I invested 25k in it um on basically like no questions asked give him 25k I think it's doing like maybe a million or something but I think their big problem is customer acquisition so one plus one equals a hundred here I am talk about it maybe blow this up and you don't need that many people to do it in order for it to do very well but I think their problem is that so Nick makes a [ __ ] ton of money I think off story worth you think so um because oh because it's automated right you don't need any employees you basically build it once and it and then you just Market it um whereas this you got to actually have a writer work with every single person that buys it so I think it's a much harder business model but as a customer I think it's a really awesome idea I feel like these are the businesses that AI is gonna like just really help all their margins because you can have an AI biographer like an antibiographer is like a very good use case for these llms where they can ask questions that they know will poke and prod they can take your responses and ask follow-ups and they can summarize all the audio that's coming in and transcribe it for so so that the writer then can come in take the source material and like you could cut the writer's work down by something probably like 50 to 80 percent did you guys see the book or the business called um it was called book in a box then it was called scribe and Sean was a customer of them but basically uh my friend Tucker Max started it and he hired a CEO to run it and basically you would talk to someone for I don't even remember how long and you pay 30 or 40 or 50 Grand the prices have gone up throughout the years and they write a book for you and it's mostly business people who want to write a book and eventually like it's paid speaking in Consulting gigs but I thought it was doing great and all of a sudden out of nowhere not only did go bankrupt but like there was like petitions from the authors who were who worked for the company as as uh contractors are like revolting and like it's caused a lot of controversy but they owe you Sean a book right you paid them like tens of thousands of dollars and you just forgot about it or you bailed on it yeah it was like you know I bought I paid I was like oh yeah I want to write a book great these people help you write a book they'll you know I'm a guy with more ideas than time this will save me time fantastic let's let's try this and it's the same sort of idea like they you have the book idea the concepts they hop on the phone with you they help you flush it out it's like great I want to collaborator with that and then as you're fleshing it out you're basically you can talk and they're taking all the notes and then they'll draft in your you know in the voice that you want and you edit right and I was like oh that seems like a good idea but I was so busy like we we started the milk road I was like okay I'm if I'm operating a business I have to like do this well and so I paused it and not not just an iposite we have like five friends who all bought books and then pause them for various reasons nailed not bailed in our mind the door was always open and uh and yeah the door's still open I guess we just have to pay a little more money to get it finished now if we want to well you know um I think I can say this because they tweeted it but enduring Ventures uh Xavier and sieva they bought it yes just uh yeah today I wasn't is that public yeah he tweeted it like he tweeted it out I've heard I'd heard about that but I wasn't sure if he was going to do it or not I don't know what's going on behind the scenes but for a company to go bankrupt that quickly without like any type of signs I wonder if something's going on um but I I it seems like it might be a headache but maybe it won't be we'll see yeah I actually did it too like years ago I was thinking about I'm working on a book actually right now I ended up not doing it with scribe but um I tried it and I just found that it's great I think if you want to write like a a corporate handbook that you can hand out to like your employees or something like that like a Cheesy business book but if you actually want to write something like really really serious and legit I think it's a bit hard I know David Goggins is like their their hit he's their hit but I think it's just hard again for the reasons we talked about with no story lost how do you guarantee quality when you have that much demand and stuff like I think you'd have to move up Market I've been waiting for you to mention that you have doing the book thing because I wasn't sure if it was public or not Sean you should read his first chapter I read the whole thing normally people ask me to prove stuff and I'm like I don't want to and then I started reading his and I was like okay I'm actually into this it's pretty good it's been quite good yeah I can't wait I think it's gonna be amazing oh thanks dude how far yeah I'll share it with you I just sent the publisher my rough draft it's still I'd say it's still in the phase where like I'm embarrassed by it um but I know that's the important step to making it amazing um so yeah I think it'll come in 2024. what's your motivation why write a book honestly kind of to like muddle through like a there's a lot of lessons that I haven't read in other books around um business and stuff that we've learned so it's kind of the story of building tiny but also just to kind of muddle through the exact thing we were talking about before about how everybody wants more um you know it's never enough they're always trying to upgrade they're always trying to get bigger they're always trying to do the next thing and play the status game or you know comes from childhood trauma or you know something else and so for me it's been about pulling that string for myself so it's been a bit of kind of personal exploration and stuff um it's been it's been fun I've really enjoyed it it's probably the thing I've enjoyed most over the last couple years our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better do you want to talk about some of these other companies I know you have routines on here you have I don't even know how to pronounce this one it looks like a Hawaiian name yeah let me let me Buzz through both um so routines is really smart so you know when you listen to Tim Ferriss interview um it's like two hours and sometimes you're just like look dude like look doctor you know gut microbiome doctor just tell me what you do what do you do what do I take what do I buy uh and I actually was talking to Tim Ferriss about this and I was like dude you've got to add like a little segment at the end where you just say here's the books here's the one book recommendation here's one product recommendation here's one habit recommendation from each guest he never did it too bad um but that's the Jew that's the stuff that I ask people when I'm one-on-one with them and so my friend Hamza who I think you know too Sam yeah I use this agency it's good Tampa yeah there are agencies called Tamba t-a-m-b-a uh they do really good work but um so he created this site called routines so it's routines.club is the URL and what it does is it basically runs you through the day of successful people and so they do like huberman Tim Ferriss Peter attia uh they actually just did one on Andrew Wilkinson yeah yeah and and basically breaks down my entire day from start to finish and it's all these things that I wouldn't even think to share it's like you know how do I organize my email how do I um you know what supplements do I take in the morning your shower and skin routine is huge right shower and skin all these random things what's really funny is he's used he's used um uh mid-journey or whatever to generate images for all the things so it's this like terrifying hey you look like first picture I mean this is just a plus I mean mid-journey is like you know the world's greatest wingman here second picture now you're you I feel like this is like these are two different people these are not the same person uh but that's you know one of those challenges so you wake up six to eight a.m all right big window um drinkable it's depending on if my kids wake me take a big glass of water with electrolytes if it's sunny you make air press coffee nice nice plug um if it's overcast you use retimer what's retimer it's like these little goggles that you wear and they blast your eyes with uh bright light they're to help you kind of wake up in the morning like if it's not sunny out you know how huberman is like go outside and see bright lights oh this is great you don't have to go outside yeah so you don't have to go outside I'm looking anyway there's like if you read through it it'll take like 20 minutes because there's so many freaking things dude you take you take 10 supplements uh yeah like on and off depending on what they are well here's you have a good morning routine by the way was it coffee you snort coke uh yeah I shoot up I shoot heroin right between my toes and it actually says where which foot to do it in um but but so here's what's cool about this business is people want to share this stuff right it's like a very infinitely shareable like listicle of like here's this person's routine or whatever but throughout it if you look at the huberman one for example he recommends ag-1 he recommends cold plunges supplements it's all affiliate Revenue yeah and so it's just like one of these amazing build the content ones update it occasionally focused on SEO make like thirty thousand dollars a month plus of um affiliate it's just a perfect we talked about earlier like the launch pad business it's not the sexy business it's the launch pad this is cool I like this uh I like this example do the Maui Nui one what is that so this one is really I I thought this was super goofy uh when I heard about it and so basically me and my girlfriend we were visiting Maui um and huberman was like oh you should meet this guy um Jake who runs Maui Nui and so this guy picks me up in this like ramshackle truck he looks like a Navy SEAL he's like the super jacked guy Ai and he starts telling me he drives us into this huge Ranch that they have and he starts telling me about the business and basically um there's these deer called access deer and they're from Asia I have a on my Ranch yeah some Hawaiian royalty brought them to Hawaii to hunt like 150 years ago and because they had no natural Predators they're just an invasive species they're like rats they're like everywhere and it's actually an environmental problem so they're like a pest they actually destroy the ecosystem and so the government literally flies helicopters and takes like you know machine guns and just guns these things down that's their current solution to this and so Jake was like hey we could this is great meat a lot of native Hawaiians hunt the meat and it's super healthy and delicious they sell it locally but the FDA doesn't let you sell meat uh commercially and so he basically spent the last seven years getting approval to actually hunt and sell this meat and it's this like super complex problem so there's this interesting moat in the business it's going to take someone else like seven to ten years to compete and basically what they do is they have a bunch of professional Hunters go with sniper rifles and they in the middle of the night they just shoot these deer in the head right and it has to be the FDA is like it has to be in the head like so imagine this you're a deer you get to live this awesome life you are eating organic food you're running all over Hawaii and then one day in your sleep you just boom you're dead right and so I was like okay this is really fascinating uh so huberman Tim Ferriss attia they all invested too um and here's what's crazy about the meat so not only is it like the most ethical meat you could possibly have because it's like a past these deer like killed super ethically and stuff but they've tested it and it has crazy micro nutrient content so a piece of salmon is like 14 protein this is 20 protein like beef is like nine percent it's good for the environment the animals live natural lives and then one day Boom headshot gone and so if you're like uh you know you're not eating meat for ethical reasons or for health reasons this is like an incredible business and so these guys sell like I think like 10 20 million dollars a year of pepperoni sticks and all this stuff so anyway go check it out Maui I'm ordering this stuff did you invest in this I did yeah can you tell I mean I'm giving you the full your sales pitches are good um Sam how did you you said you have these uh these same deer on your Ranch randomly in Texas he just told this story about like how this Japanese royalty brought it to Hawaii and it's like this whole special thing you're like yeah I got I got what are you talking about well so it's just I I don't know anything about animals or hunting but out in my farm you can only hunt normal deer I think for two or three months out of the year but we have this thing called Axis deer I don't know if access deer is like a category of animal or what no I'm looking at it looks the same they're basically deers with spots on them and sometimes they have like tall ears or uh and so they kind of look different but they're called Axis deer they have spots and they're all over Texas I don't know if it's like the same thing um or if it's like a category of animal but yeah we have them in Texas I love how this random guy in Hawaii just told a fascinating story I got it guys they're rats that are everywhere actually that's like you know totally like they just needed to get this like waste product off their hands or like you know this thing's got 20 protein 80 look and 100 power of oil I'm buying this I love this man this is great like yeah and I'll be like oh you need an access deer I got a guy you know like every everyone like 20 years ago was really into like drinking milk right like got milk and then it was almond milk then it was oat milk you guys are gonna love my next business it's rat milk are you serious no I could have I'm gonna order some of this beef I'm uh so like over the last two weeks I've gotten a little soft you know I had a little injury so I didn't work out like religiously over the last two weeks and I've been eating a lot of ice cream because it's hot so for the next 30 days Sean you should try and join this with me I'm only gonna eat meats and or uh planted animals I gotta get I gotta get back to basic planted animals oh yeah that's good I like the way you branded that that's nice plants and animals that's for the next 30 days I gotta get my action together because I've been eating too much ice cream but I'm gonna order this stuff uh I'm gonna order it this actually looks great is this a fun business to run it looks fun to run but it might be a headache you gotta ship this [ __ ] all the way from Hawaii I think it's super complicated I think they can charge a premium because I think they're the only people that are FDA approved to sell it and you know they have the story and the brand and the investors and stuff but it's a hard business for that same reason right I mean there's a lot of people there's a lot of hunters um on the Hawaiian islands that want the jobs and stuff but logistically you know these guys are basically going on these like uh hikes in the middle of the night to go and do these like you know they're sniping deer and then they have to shoulder carry them back to the truck and then they've got this whole facility there to process them and stuff isn't the problem isn't the problem with this so I I've got a lot of like I've got a bunch of the funny thing about Austin is it's full of like crazy Health people like like you know you don't even know like are they actually insane or are they being serious like you know they're afraid of Wi-Fi but every once in a while some of these guys will say something that's like really interesting and like turns out they're right and one of them being is like do you know butcher box butcher boxes bootstrapped and I think it does like two or three hundred million dollars in Revenue but my health nut friends hate it they talk trash about it they're like this is the war first you should never consume that meat these guys will also say like Whole Foods they don't even touch Whole Foods Chicken they're like you can't it's Gotta like if it's not it doesn't look a certain way I don't touch it you're hanging out with Justin mares too much I didn't want to name names I don't know if Justin if if Justin has said that explicitly but yeah they're in the same Circle it just sounds like something that Justin would say for he's probably correct though he's probably but that's my thing it's these guys I'll be like all right but are you being like a conspiracy or are you being like truthful and they're like this one's a little closer to conspiracy but then with like the meat stuff like this is close to truthful but the problem with this business I would think is the bigger it gets the worse it gets right well I think when I talk to him about scaling and stuff he was like look there's a lot of Hawaiian Islands there's a lot of deer is there though I think is it yeah oh yeah well there's six or seven of them or whatever right and they they basically they do this on a tiny amount of land as it is right now so I think they can't really I think you're thinking about the signal it's not a business investment there might be a business here this is a Larry Ellison investment this is a this is some rich people do which is as you make money you start investing just in things that are interesting you start you start investing in dinner party conversations it's like I can't have my whole portfolio of like healthcare SAS like even if that's where you know like the most money is made I need to invest in things that are interesting to me that are cool people that I want to hang out with that do businesses that are worth talking about in life and there's like there's like a positive EV associated with that that people don't really understand until you you start doing it and then you're like oh this is nice you just gotta keep the check small and do a bunch of these and so you have this portfolio of like interesting this one day I think I I would say I would say you're wrong um so uh so so imagine like you're saying the same thing about athletic greens right okay so I come to you and I'm like hey guys there's like these these guys they're like a vitamin but it's powder and you're like that's the stupidest thing I've ever heard what makes athletic greens amazing amazing is that they spent the last 15 years building relationships with all the most influential Health people in the world so it's one plus one equals a hundred right they have Tim Ferriss they have all these people who not only they buy ads with but they also have all these people owning equity in the business so a million different competitors can come out but if in your brain the winner is ag-1 because that's what you've heard and all the people that you respect do you will do it and you will pay a premium right yeah but that's different like vitamins were a thing uh vitamins were a thing greens green smoothies people understood oh I should eat my vegetables that's been around forever I don't know how many people are like oh man the protein content on my salmon is too low I need to eat deer I need to eat this bread it's bigger than you think it's bigger than you know what I'm looking for a deer that was shot in the head that's what I know but there's a huge there's a huge audience though for people who go I want ethically sources I do that right that's why I don't like buying a lot of speech is because I I don't like how they kill cows Sean you actually kind of turned me on to that uh about like about the treatment of cows well I think this is very hypocritical I think you know anybody who's like ethically sourced meat it's like uh you know like yeah if somebody's like I ethically killed your dog or I ethically killed your your brother it's like you know no but there's a big difference well it's not necessarily killing it's raising I think and then killing and then correct think about it think about it correct think about it this way so there's there's a broad spectrum right so you think about like industrialized meat is like concentration camps for animals right they're literally in these pens and they're fed this horrible stuff and they have these miserable lives I don't feel good about eating that do I feel good about eating an animal who lived a great life and then got sniper rifled in the head yeah I feel fine I actually feel fine there's definitely a spectrum just to be clear though this is still in the murdering for our pleasure uh for our mouth Pleasures part of the spectrum and there's a there's a lot more part of the spectrum that you go to if you chose to I'm I'm uh I'm totally a bit of a hypocrite on this as in I do eat meat so I'm not like I'm not like a vegan telling you this but at least I don't lie to myself and tell myself that oh man I'm doing so such a good thing morally here by uh a Kill by killing them the best way the nice way yeah you it's like it's like you might drive an electric car and it's better than driving a gas car but you're still producing tons of toxic chemicals because we made the batteries and stuff it's just a little bit better yeah that's right I agree with you though I do think like in 100 years we'll look back at eating meat and be a little shocked yeah 100 um that's my my opinion Sean would you would you if we went somewhere would you like for example for Thanksgiving did I tell you for Thanksgiving we killed our own turkey no you didn't tell me that how was that uh yeah and so would you do that no wow okay not that I wouldn't do it would I be excited am I excited to go do that no would I do it if that's the thing we wanted to do sure I'm not like anti the whole experience but uh I'm not like pumped about that nor would I like see that experience out also turkey massively overrated it sucks separate issue and by the way killing it and eating it it did not taste good at all the fake [ __ ] like the Butterball turkeys taste way better and turkey is a is a horrible meat but yeah I agree um what do we want to wrap up with one or two more things yeah let's do uh well you have a question for Sam I think that's an interesting one why don't you do that one Andrew yeah I was curious so Sam like I look at Hampton Hampton is a business I mean I've said this to you privately but Hampton is the business that I've thought about starting for 10 years so I joined something called entrepreneurs organization uh 15 years ago and I was like this is a very very good business every member of EO pays five thousand dollars and there's all these local chapters they self-organize basically and these guys just must be making an absolute killing and you have this total lock-in because once you like your Forum group you have these like core core groups like you do at Hampton or whatever people don't want to leave they're locked in they pay their five thousand dollars a year or whatever it is they go to events Etc and so I for years have been like someone needs to start the new EO and you have and so I look at it and I I go freak damn I wish I owned that business um what are the things though like just like you guys being like Oh my God like you know these agencies Andrew Owens are the best businesses ever what are the on the flip side what are the things that we we should know about Hampton that are make it hard to run or surprise you about running so the thing about Hampton so Andrew joined and Sean John has been like messaging like maybe I should join and I'm like Andrew wanted to he's like yeah just take my money and just let me join I'm like no no no you have to get interviewed I just want a little VIP treatment I just want a little past line it's like we've not done it to go to a friend's restaurant and you just get treated as a normal Patron how does it feel good it's not the same I agree that feels a little bad wouldn't you think well because we have to have we have to indoctrinate people we have to like get them into the values of the system we have to like teach them how to be a good Community member so the thing about Hampton is that in terms of like the physics behind it this is going to be a massive company I think uh like there's I always tell our team there's nothing holding us back like there's like very little like outside factors that are gonna ruin it but the number one thing that sucks about it and that we we 100 can screw it up and it can go to zero is if you start letting in too many people too quickly so you cannot scale it like crazy fast um I think you can scale it fast but I think you can't scale it like you could a software you're not just throwing bodies into it and so we have to be super thoughtful about it about who we let in and why another thing is is that the feedback loop is fairly short so people in Hampton have monthly meetings and then now we have Retreats that people go on once a year or twice a year so we don't get feedback that quickly and in order to like I can't just like make an assumption or I can't like have like an MVP of a retreat because someone's flying across the country to go to a thing so it has to be good right away and that's very stressful that I can't like just like you know if I own like a Shopify store I can't just throw up a product up there and have someone buy it and then just return the money and be like sorry it'll come soon or this sucks maybe but it'll improve with tech um so that's scary about not having MVPs but you it the the thing about Community is once you screw it up I don't think you can fix it and so it seems like it's high stakes all the time and so that's why we're trying to be meticulous about growing slowly um I don't know Andrew what am I missing you've kind of like no I think you're right I it's interesting the thing that made me leave EO um so the chapter um the guy who ran the chapter super nice guy like amazing I love the guy but he let in a couple people who I really really didn't like and I found myself dreading going to some of the events and just kind of just sketchy people right like people that ran a bit dicey businesses and gave me bad vibes and stuff and that was actually the thing that caused me to leave EO and do my own forums so I now have four forums that I just managed myself um but I I don't think most people are like me I think most people will stick with it but you do really have to be thoughtful about who you let in and I I think the hardest part and I've had this experience I've ran a lot of forums over the last 15 years and been in a lot of forums if there's someone who's toxic the cancer has to be cut out but that is an incredibly awkward conversation and it can really piss people off obviously and we've fired a punch but we've kicked people out if they like talk about confidential stuff publicly but um also another thing about this these businesses the thing about EO YPO Visage do you guys know vistage I think I mentioned them they sold for like 1.5 billion recently they're already doing like half a billion in Revenue dude they last so long so YPO EO and Visage I think all were either started in the 50s or the 60s and so the cool thing about these companies is if you nail it right you can have it for 50 or 100 years and so that's why I'm really fascinated by these types of companies because there's zero technological or there's zero Tech like Tech everything can change with AI it will have zero hope I think how does how does it feel to be sitting on a winner like does it did you feel the same way with the hustle does this feel different yeah I I felt like the hustle like with with Hampton I'm like well there's a clear path to get to 100 million dollars you just got to give it 10 years if you want uh in Revenue like I just have to like it's just a Time Horizon thing you just gotta sit and wait and you have to work but you have to wait whereas with the hustle it felt a little bit more like we were making we are innovating in a very small space where I'm like I don't know if the math shows that this will work it might it might not but I'm we're still learning with this business I'm like no it's 100 gonna work the only thing that screws it up is ourselves that's why I say there's no like physics allows this to work perfectly you also have an unfair Advantage right I think that if you I mean I guess you launched Hampton privately you didn't promote it but now that you did it's so unfair now that you have talked about it you have like you have free customer acquisition yes you you almost have 50 million dollars a year versus a free marketing by going on podcasts on this podcast and other podcasts you're on and just talking about Hampton and then your brand value as a person being associated with it it is that one plus one equals 100 yes and right now we've had five or six or seven thousand people I forget apply and so that makes it like the easiest thing ever but if you look at on deck on Deck had that as well and they totally [ __ ] it up they [ __ ] it up because they they treated it like a tech company where they weren't thoughtful and enough and they try to just scale and that is my fear of like getting greedy and growing too quickly well they raised they raised Ventures why would you raise Venture it's like this is a business that pays for it's got you have negative cash conversion cycle right people pre-pay you for services delivered over a year and like it's insane yeah so it's like a great business I think it's going to be like I don't think we'll ever sell it but I think it could be like a they can be billion dollar companies I think um so it feels good well tiny if you ever decide to sell it tiny bro I I or if you ever want to take money off the table I think I hopefully it'll be big enough that we'll be buying you I I mean no but and seriously when I was looking the reason Andrew even though we're friends I really admire you because when I people have been asked to invest and I'm like no dude this is my meta lab baby like this could like this is what I love I don't ever want to sell it but it might make a [ __ ] ton of profit and we can just use that profit to buy stuff that kind of uh supplements it um and I don't want to take any money because I don't want to have to feel guilty about doing that we're gonna I'm gonna uh be on a helicopter and it'll land on Sam's yacht and then I'll I'll get there and he'll be like oh what's your market cap and I'll be like oh like five billion and he'll be like oh Hampton's 25 billion that's cute no I don't know I remember when we hit five those are things the come-up is always the most I got a lot of advice for you earlier I think it's cool but it it feels like I haven't talked about it publicly too much is because this is the first time where I'm like I'm just gonna shut the [ __ ] up and just be quiet and just keep on going um because it's working nicely I think it's actually quite hard to replicate though you have to have an audience it was quite hard to like get the uh early customers but yeah it feels good well it's it you're reading the right book right like reading the Buffett stuff and moats because that I think that's like the ultimate like people think investing is numbers there's a little bit of that there's napkin math but at the end of the day it's like assessing like what is the mo what's the competitive advantage and you just have such a crazy competitive advantage in terms of customer acquisition and then also customer life and Sean I know that you're exploring this business even before I don't even think you told me so it's the big learning it's a logistical nightmare so not nightmare but it's very challenging like in like imagine let's say we have 10 000 members and we're doing all these Retreats that's basically a retreat a day you know what I mean like yeah it's quite challenging logistically what we need to do is go and hire a bunch of McKinsey nerds and it's like here's how we do it by hand automate it uh but I don't I don't agree with that I think um so what EO does is they've outsourced everything so when you EO has chapters there's a Vancouver chapter for example uh all the members pay their dues and then there's a chapter head and they are managing that whole thing and then when they have Retreats they're just told hey um you know the budget typically is this you guys all self-organize one person from The Forum is responsible for managing it here's the handbook on doing it and they just kind of do it themselves so I think there may be there's a better way to do it but I don't think you have to scale up headcount legit no I don't think you do either but you still have thousands of people flying places and you want to make sure that the experience is optimal so there's still some quality control are you gonna do like a massive conference like a super Conference of all the people in Hampton with like insane speakers and stuff or is that just too much Logistics yeah we want to yeah I'm just trying to figure out how to do it Andrew what is this uh profit first methodology that's that book that you like I love this so yeah one of the guys um one of the CEOs is actually the CEO of beam um he sent me this book and um I love the idea so basically um you know there's this concept of like if you eat your food on a smaller plate you're gonna eat less you guys know about that um so basically what you do it's very simple let's say that you earn a hundred dollars in your business and you want to have a 50 profit margin you just take the day the hundred dollars comes in you take fifty dollars and you put it in a bank account that you can't see and that's it you just put it away and so then you and your team are left with fifty dollars to run the business and you know you might have to adjust the number and figure out what's sustainable but what I learned running um all my digital businesses was that we had businesses with 90 net profit margins and if you had looked at that business and said okay well it's this kind of business it should have twenty percent profit margins we easily could have run it that way but because Chris and I were incentivized we own the whole business we paid a lot of attention to the p l and what was possible we would try and run it at the maximum profit and so this basically allows you to achieve the same thing psychologically as the smaller plate You're just showing you're basically budgeting for fifty percent profit and you're saying figure that cause issues with your CEO of the company but we don't do it this isn't something that we do this is something that we've sent out to all of our CEOs as like hey this is really interesting this might be something you might want to do but I think it works better for small businesses I know a lot of people who um they talk to me and they're like oh you know I have an agency too but we just can't figure out how to make it run at X margins and I'm I kind of go like rip the Band-Aid right if you want to make 30 profit margins take thirty dollars of every hundred dollars that comes in you move it to another bank that's what you told me to do and I've not been comfortable with it yet dude you yeah don't even get me started [Music] Sam Sam and I have had like Tech screaming matches me just being like dude you have to Dividend your money out because my whole thing is um you don't want to leave excess cash burning a hole in the CEO's Pockets or making them complacent so let's say you own a business that has a payroll of five hundred thousand dollars a month a lot of people will leave like 20 million dollars in that business and I think that just lets the CEO feel relaxed I like them to basically have a month two months of cash but you're spending you're spending cash that you haven't earned yet well sometimes but if if that's the situation and they need more then they just say hey shareholders uh send me some of that money back but you say I'm the bank so for example in tiny tiny the holding company above is the bank and we basically say look keep your money with us and um if you guys hit a snag and you need a little bit of extra money for payroll or r d or whatever we'll send that right down in you know 12 hours so for prepaid meta customers which you I don't actually think you do prepay but let's say you did let's say someone prepaid for a project that will take a year and it's a hundred grand and you get that up front you're happy or you're willing to spend that 100 Grand before the years up and the service has been fully delivered well not always but I think if you can model it and like so for example the argument we were having so someone pays ten thousand dollars for a year of service in Hampton and so you guys have all this cash sitting in the bank the thing is you guys have new members constantly streaming in so you have ten thousand dollars flowing in x times a day you have very predictable cash flow from my perspective I would basically just say all right what's your what's your uh expected margin and I just take that and dividend it out immediately um and I and again it's trying to create a feeling of always always paying attention to the bank account always paying attention to the balance sheet and the p l and I just think that when you have a year of cash just sitting there I think you your CEO will naturally be like oh we could do this you know we could go do a super conference and spend 10 million dollars on it or um you know what it's okay we didn't uh do that great this month because you know we've got all this money in the bank I think psychologically you want everyone eating from a smaller place and when you say dividend out what percentage is Andrew Wilkinson taking home to buy a home in cars and live versus dividend out to reinvest into your own stuff I had like a well so it's different now that we're public what I used to do is I would get I owned 80 percent of um of beam basically and I would get so I'd get 80 of those dividends those would go to my holding company I would buy stocks or invest my general framework for this though is I want to spend five percent of what I earn at most and so whatever that number is if you're in you know 10 million dollars a year 500 Grand a year is just living doing whatever and everything else should get invested so you live on five percent of your of your income and the rest goes to Tiny or whatever is the setup for your holding company or is Tiny considered your holding company tiny is my well so I have a personal holding company where I have my personal assets but you know 90 plus percent of my net worth isn't tiny hmm so and has it always been five percent so when you're earning a million dollars a year when you're earning a million dollars a year were you only spending fifty thousand no I was well I wasn't spending a ton but I was what I was doing is starting a lot of businesses I would I would say maybe it was 20 or 30 back then but over time it's come down to about five percent or less and it's been there for probably 10 years um but um but yeah one of the things I see that a lot of people do that's really quite stupid is they don't let themselves live it up so they'll own this amazing cash flowing business and they don't let themselves you know go by the beautiful house go buy the great car and so they end up acting in this way where they go well I've got to sell my company I've got to have an exit and I have I have had friends where it's like dude the exit was right in your bank account you know you could have just dividended the money out to yourself and then you wouldn't have had this really stressful horrible experience with private equity and been through all that stuff um so I'm a big advocate of like living it up living a nice life you know don't go crazy and buy Faberge eggs but like buy a nice car in a nice house and whatever and then just invest everything what percentage of your income do you spend Sean uh I don't know I don't even think about like that um is that like is that are you allergic to that or or would you I'm not allergic to it but it's it's like you said like you know uh I would say my income has 10x and my spending has 2x so as long as that ratio stays about right that's fine yeah I don't really look at the percentage versus versus earnings so much as like you know before I guess like at the beginning when the earnings were lower right like for a long time I was basically earning like between I don't know like in my 20s I was making like 120 to 160k a year roughly uh for a bunch of my 20s and you know during that time I don't know I was probably I was living in San Francisco paying California taxes like you know I was probably spending uh if you include taxes you know I was spending the bulk of my money I wasn't really saving that much probably saving 20 of my money 30 I don't know something like that um and you know the uh Tim Ferriss said this thing on this podcast I really liked he goes um unless Something's Gonna Make a [ __ ] ton of money give it away for free I think that's a great rule in business and content and a great room for creators like us I think the uh which is partly why I don't like your your Twitter experiment although I understand the reasons why you do it um I think there's the same thing for sort of like you know where do you put your mental energy around finances it's like either needs to make a lot of money or save a lot of money or I'm just gonna like not pay I'm gonna give it zero budget mentally um because otherwise I'm just using my mental Budget on too many things I'm just not gonna think I don't want to think about things unless it's like a a large swing so for most of most of my 20s I was just trying to figure out how do you make way more money like I'm not trying to go from 20 savings rate to 30 savings rate it's like how do I 10x my income that was like the first you know like it's all I was thinking about it took me a long time but like that paid off because once you do that you don't you're you're so glad you're never worried about the the smaller thing yeah ramit Sethi has a great book called I will teach you to be great and he talks a lot about that right people obsess over like oh you know I used to spend six bucks on a Frappuccino and now I just buy a black coffee and save three bucks and it's like you're so much better off focusing on the macro you know your mortgage all those sorts of big expenses and then just focusing on making way more money to the point where it really doesn't matter he goes don't focus on three dollar problems like a cup of coffee focus on thirty thousand dollar problems like getting a raise notice this with hiring too like you hire somebody and um I'm negotiating like a 5k or 10K salary difference and I'm like okay um so you know you're this basically like an 800 a month gross uh difference net to them after taxes is gonna be like 500 a month difference okay fair enough not saying that that's nothing but like the percentage of their concern around that difference versus like the role who I am what they're going to learn from this like how like they don't really think about how do I use this opportunity to be able to make 10 times more money in the future or or better what are the terms on their stock options how are they struck what's the valuation is it reasonable yeah or like yeah what's mine what is my incentive if I could do a great job what does a great job even look like here and then how much is that worth to you and can I structure an incentive where if I really knock it out the park I can make three times my salary this year versus this kind of like 10K you know salary Gap um but you know I I guess obviously not everybody cares that way or thinks that way but uh I don't know it seems like of of 100 of the population it seems like at least 20 of the population should be asking themselves those types of questions more often um in the same way that like before I met any business people I just thought like when oh after college you go get a job I didn't think there were other options and only once I saw that there's these other options in that man there's people doing business they seem to be having a lot more fun and making more money like okay I guess I could go do that it's like you just sometimes need to see it or hear it and then it changes the way you think and I think more people should see or hear the question of like how do I make three times more in half the time how do I make 10 times more total how do I have twice the fun on the same salary how do I twice the time on the same salary it's like there are just better questions you can ask yourself that the ones really although I will say one thing that I really miss you do you guys remember we started that business called buyer where it was negotiation that was an awesome idea yeah amazing idea amazing guy who ran it kimya um we ended up selling it to ramp um I didn't really want to sell it but for Kimia it was like his first big access so so it made a lot of sense and we're really excited for him but I really missed that business because that's one thing where I'm just too busy running my business to negotiate things and you know when I'm buying like a car or you know doing a um I don't know any like a big buy of furniture or like a renovation or anything I still want that so I really I put this out to the audience someone needs to restart that business negotiation as a service that's in the cube that's a great Nick Huber business I agree are you gonna make money on the stock of ramp ramped is does good I think we we didn't we didn't take stop stock we just took cash because we for us we could just take the money and invest it ourselves so we knew we could get a good return within tiny dude these are the best podcasts these are the best podcasts so we're just what we're just hanging out uh I wonder if the listener prefers these where it's uh like it just hangs but I like those better personally yeah that was super fun guys if you like it compliment us into YouTube comments if you don't like it well you're probably gone by now thank you [Music] foreign

what was reported I think was 30 to Connor and 100 to Floyd was that what was reported I think it was hot for certainly higher for Conor that I know and and you know for Floyd I would imagine it would be probably around there or higher just depending on what he did again wow do you really think that 100 million was true well I mean I I Connor was on you know I'd say just under a hundred right when it's all said and done so that's his part so again he has a part we had a partner in the UFC so and I will get into the specifics but yeah so for Floyd's side it's very reasonable to think that he could have pulled in a hundred uh assuming that he he didn't take it all [Music] Audi I I I see all these interviews with you I see you on the UFC like behind the scenes stuff and you're always wearing slick suits and you're dressed nice right now but I just saw that you're drinking out of a Stanley mug just to remind everyone at home that no matter how fancy someone is we all have a little basicness inside of us you know I always say like you know it's business much like sports you have to you know you wear your uniform to play the game right okay but we're all human at the end of the day we all have our casual clothes or you know our at home I've only seen one interview you and I've watched a bunch of interviews there's only one interview that you weren't wearing a suit you're wearing like Lululemon and a hat the only time I'm gonna have to switch it up now man that's it you know I have to switch it up but it's a pleasure to meet you guys man you should Zig and zag the other way because I think a lot of people in the like agents talent management they all are all like very slick looking you should go the other way right like um you should go athleisure as your main thing because you were an athlete so I feel like you can pull that off and a lot of guys in that space will all look like suits to you know in comparison I'm gonna have to man I'm gonna have to to make people remember that I was actually one of them before I became a suit exactly well there there was some bum out there in San Francisco who was the first person to wear just like you know pajama bottoms and a t-shirt instead of a suit you you just that's that that's your burden now I guess I was from Cali too so I gotta start just rocking flip-flops you know what I mean just just all good with the flip-flops in the shorts in Silicon Valley uh it's like the opposite like I remember when I first moved here I went to like this nice kind of like Club Speakeasy type thing and everybody's waiting in line and a guy walks up with a hoodie and you know it just looks completely disheveled and the bouncers know like all right this guy's either homeless or a billionaire we don't know which one we gotta just err on the side of maybe this is like the next Mark Zuckerberg let him in let them in first and go that way I realized oh the status game is different here that's funny I heard a lot about that yeah certainly uh Counter Culture if you go to business the noble the New York the New York hustle is all suit and tie whereas the San Francisco hustle is definitely flip-flops and and holes in your T-shirt you know so your introduction here is it's it's it's there's you've got a bunch of stuff so so you've started Paradigm which is uh and you just call it an agency a sports agency sports management company I'd say it's a Sports Management entertainment platform it's what it is platform all right with uh the most famous guy being Conor McGregor but I also think you have Izzy do you have one more champion on there I thought you had three so Izzy's a former client of ours but definitely was an amazing client while he was with us uh Michael Bisping uh Stephen Thompson Michael Ben and Paige Rico verhuven uh past clients obviously like Chris Lytle who's actually one of my first clients that's how I got into the sport um but yeah very fortunate to work with some of the the greatest fighters of all time though yeah so just a bunch of Ballers but then you also co-founded proper 12 which we're gonna ask you all about it but according to the headlines it was like a 600 million dollar exit so you've had some maybe even more success there than the main thing what's cool is uh so you run a a talent kind of like let's say what part of your business how talent management talent agency and that's cool there's a bunch of our audience that also owns agencies which I think is great but what I liked about you is that you have also kind of the Venture side so you're like creating Brands and business ventures off the talent and we've talked about these kind of Creator brands in the past we had uh you know Mr Beast on here and he's got all these kind of like feastables he's got other uh you know corporate Brands underneath it we had a Instagram star Danny Austin come on and she's got Divi like a hair care brand that's doing you know way more money than she can get kind of just in in versus like influencer brand deals and so what I like is that you've got and Rob Dyrdek yeah Rob Dyrdek you've got both and that's been a theme that we've kind of been been playing with so I think we'll we'll try to hop around a little bit but I definitely bless you bless you I mean I'll be remiss if I didn't give you those two sorry oh wow what a gentleman look at that hello John May edit it out and and then yeah that's that's a character shower right there I'm like I'm talking if Sam's dying over there I'm gonna finish my point I don't care oh yeah he's good he'll come back yeah exactly no no I appreciate the recognition look I mean we we certainly I feel were one of the early um you know platforms slash agencies if you will that really saw not only um you know an opportunity but more so wanted to do more for our clients right we wanted to disrupt our respective industry but also think far beyond that and not just think transactional and for me in mixed martial arts it was an underserved market and we wanted to not only advocate for our clients but advocate for the school for it really push fighter fighter uh not only earnings uh higher and higher which still have a long way to go but they've come a long way from when we first started and back in 2009 in in the sport and we were very fortunate because we came in right before the first um you know rights deal was was actually paid you know the UFC was paying to be on Spike prior to the fox deal and and as you know most people know that's the main economic driver of any professional sports organization whether it's the you know NFL the NBA and now obviously from from a mixed martial arts perspective the UFC they were paying Spike to put themselves on TV that's a that's publicly no they were actually you know paying for that air time so the original Ultimate Fighter and then all all that was broadcast on Spike back in the day um yeah they were not only funding their own production but they're paying for that air time and and fox was that really first paid deal that the UFC uh garnered you know and which was a Monumental uh milestone for the sport and and for the promotion and sport of mixed martial arts you know is is it wouldn't be here without the UFC which is the Catalyst but where the sport is today now you have other promotions that are competing and promotion is very synonymous with leagues right so when you talk about leagues um you know it's there's certain terminologies within the sports world that are very similar although there's a lot of differences as well right in terms of you know athletes in NFL MBA being employees and then Fighters being independent contractors so for us we saw an opportunity of it not only being the fastest growing sport in an underserved market for the athletes but then also really Thinking Beyond just management how can we create you know more value for the clients and you know it takes a special client and a special personality like Conor McGregor so I was very fortunate to sign him 10 years ago and you know and and we had a vision and he was very very bullish about that Vision as well let's rewind let's rewind to that so you uh your story is kind of I'll give the first part very fast so you you play football at UCLA you end up getting injured you move into uh management side of things you got you got some kind of football players as your first clients and then you Branch into MMA and you discover Conor McGregor can you tell the story how did you how did you discover Connor what was what was his situation like at that time and uh well what was those kind of the first meeting it takes us back to those days yeah sure so um I think taking it back to the first days the early days is really working with guys like Chris Lytle right getting into the business um we're working with the guy that I got to work with him for one fight and he retired so then it was being able to sign Michael Bisping which was a massive opportunity for me and someone that I'm so proud of not only as a client but as a friend as well who went on to be the first British uh Champion first champ UFC champion from uh from the UK and you know he was a pioneer of mixed martial arts for all the up-and-coming athletes within Europe you know Ireland included so um I was very fortunate enough to start to work with Michael and and other clients as well earlier in my in my uh career in in the UFC and mixed martial arts in particular um and so when I signed Conor was when he first came on to to the to the UFC scene right he was fighting in the region no promotion in Europe cage Warriors which is still around and he's still uh you know they what's called a mid major if you will and these are these are to some extent they're professional promotions but they're feeder programs and the larger promotions if you will and um he had just signed to the UFC and we were introduced uh interestingly in us like through Facebook and you know at the time it was he was you know looking at signing with one of the agencies in the sport and I got an opportunity to uh pitch him and and Coach his coach John Kavanaugh as to why I felt that we would be the best fit for him and so you gotta you know put you know put your best foot forward and and give it a shot and and hopefully you win that business and I was fortunate enough that um you know we got first opportunity actually to work with him heading into his you know his first fight we were saying okay well let's pause now let's talk after this first fight so he beats Marcus brimage was that the uh baby yeah that's the famous line that fight and after that his second flight was his U.S debut actually against Max Holloway and we started to work with with one another um heading into that fight and so um the rest is history but one of the things you know we recognize is not only his athletic ability but then he had special special not only talent in inside the Octagon but you could tell he was very special and charismatic he had that it factor that you know is is you know I think it's it's once in a it's once in a generation type of of an athlete as well not only from a physical perspective but a qualitative perspective and so you know the sky was going to be the the limit in terms of what we could do together and was that I mean I've seen all the there's these older interviews where Connor still has acne he has no tattoos and he says like you know mark my words you will see me in the UFC you will see me as a champion one day and then coming up leading up to that Marcus fight and then I think it was Dennis silver in Boston if I remember correctly like in the early days you still see that he has some type of star power on camera but behind the scenes uh even at a young age in his early 20s did you notice that uh the confidence and the star power was there just in your normal hanging out sessions yeah you could definitely see his Charisma behind the scenes and uh you know he was like I said he was very witty uh very very confident but also very engaging you know I think one of the things I always Chelsea Bros you know majority of people in the world uh know who Conor McGregor is and I would argue that most of them have never seen him fight they've actually seen more of his interviews and and and um and him talking because you know when he talks you can't take your eyes off it awesome right he's just so fun and whether you love him or hate him you're watching him you know and that's that's I think what makes him special yeah you find a Conor is kind of like we've had guys on this podcast that are like yeah I discovered Uber I was like the fifth investor in Uber or you know like they're early investors in Facebook or something like that right it's like a it's like an angel investment that goes on to become this is what we call in Silicon Valley like a unicorn right that's like this billion dollar brand that you discover at that early age were were other people pitching in for business at that time because I remember that first brimage fight there was like a hype around him like even his entrance people were like really excited about him and I didn't know who he was at the time so I don't even know how people were so excited about the guy at that time so I imagine that you know there were other agents trying to win that business at that time um do you have any good fun anecdotes or stories of like your hustle at that time to get him or was it like no people it was kind of like a like an ignored asset people didn't realize that this was going to be that he was going to be a big deal and it really was it didn't look like it was like this hotly contested thing no I definitely think that people were were um you know hot on him but I think everybody was pitching him on the same idea it was more transactional and I think what were um I stood out surely was because I I had a broader Vision I had brought a vision of creating IP you know and creating media and content but also creating uh business ventures right and I really was bullish in on that idea uh and I I remember even when I first launched Paradigm 2009 my business plan was not only to be the best in class from a management perspective but build uh clients media and IP where whereby building more brand equities for them and that will yield not only more ants they wrote up and used from a sponsorship perspective but increased their value from a from their playing contract or prospective athletically and also leads to to business ventures and you know I I was laughed at when I first had that business plan it's too busy focused on what you could do you know like and and I think that that's what stood out to him because he had that vision for himself as well and um it was even if you think about what we did back in 2017 with the Floyd fight I mean everybody thought we were crazy you know that that fight was never going to happen and everybody doubted us everybody even some of those ended up doing the deal and partnering with us so ultimately you know we had to believe in ourselves and and more importantly go out and actually execute right because you could have dreams you could have visions you could start something but if you don't execute successfully it means nothing and now that trend is common those exhibitions now are commonplace you see everybody now taking place in these exhibitions and there's an appetite from a consumer perspective for these unique matchups where people are are uh matched up from from different sports just uh to compete in Combat Sports um and then we even launched our Venture on the back of that we launched proper 2018 and so you know again at that time I think it was maybe uh George Clooney and and maybe Puff Daddy at the time you know but I don't think anybody else now it's like Spirits everybody has some type of a liquor brand that they're they're hopping and and then Ventures is commonplace as well so you know to me I'm proud of the fact that we had this vision and we were able to execute more importantly you know because um it's very hard to do it's hand-to-hand combat every day entrepreneurship I uh I want to ask you about the proper 12 stuff but before that so like I grew up watching Entourage and so you see like Ari Emmanuel or Ari Gold dealing with like crazy young actors who have monies and money and it's like you know drugs and sex and then Ballers it's like uh drugs and sex as well but the difference between uh you know Ballers what's NFL but then there's the difference I imagine with UFC fighters where it's you're not an actor you're not a player you're gonna get out there in your underwear and fight to the death in front of millions of people can you like tell me a little bit about the difference between managing someone like Connor or an Izzy like these like because I imagine them are they crazy what's that mindset like on a daily basis in that mentality particularly when it comes to business are they have you found that you have to hold them back from being so aggressive sometimes or what's that like with that type of athlete well first of all I don't think they're crazy per se so it's not you know because of the profession or the sport that they're in that that they tend to be maybe a little bit um you know crazy so to speak right I mean like when I say crazy I mean like high risk or whatever high risk I think look it means depending on the field you're in it's that's subjective what you think high risk and not most totally most people that come from let's say if you're a neurosurgeon you're going to think the Combat Sports is super high risk right but ultimately I think every human being is different they're certainly there's certainly when you're that competitive you're gonna be driven you're gonna be more aggressive and I think I see it even in business at the same at the highest level there's there's that chip on the shoulder there's that edge that that every high level competitor has whether it's an athlete in different sports or whether it's a businessman or woman in at the highest level of their respective field so obviously business Acumen varies right so if you're talking about an Institutional Investor versus a professional athlete diverse but even within the sport you have athletes to have a very high level business Acumen Founders not trained from an Institutional perspective he didn't go get his MBA he doesn't have that that academic background if you will right but he's a very natural businessman what's a what's a story as an example I mean his story is proper 12. I mean could it easily taken a check from a sponsorship perspective and been so short-sighted as opposed to putting up our own Capital initially finding the right operating partner finding the right strategic Capital supply chain rapid Market going out and creating our own working without getting the sponsorship checked for x amount of posts or why amount of appearances if you will for an ultimate windfall that changes life and is generational well so that in itself is a great example did you guys have like Jameson we're like hey we want to sponsor you and you were like dude this Connor let's do our own thing he's always had a desire to get into whiskey it's it's like he's Irish it's part of the DNA right and his his grandfather was a was a whiskey man and we always had the idea when we were approached by a sponsor and and it was like do we go and pursue a sponsorship and take a check or do we just go and own our own business and when you study the category and looked at the tab and you looked at the opportunity you're like we could this is right for disruption we actually could really come in and do something here right and so that that's a perfect example of his natural business acting right because it's hard to do that especially at that level he wasn't making you know a ton of money yeah up until we got to the Floyd fight which is by the way when we announced our entry into the market we announced our entry into the whiskey Market in our post by press conference yeah I remember he's cold in the glass we started though the process in 2014 and we were doing a lot of research and development and pivoting from different groups and and ultimately we we found the right you know formula if you will on the right team Etc right um and and the rest is history and that to me takes a lot of a lot of intelligence for an athlete to do that's not trained how does it have the experience of building a business and you know more moreover the patients right to really bet on himself how much of your guys's Capital did you put up to get it off the ground and do you remember what your first year sales was what what was well I'll tell you I can't disclose all the information just through the strict confidentiality Provisions that exist with our partners and our acquire so I I got to be safe but I can tell you that we put up probably a few hundred thousand of our own Capital initially I could say that right um and that's you know I mean that most of that went to lawyers if you will just before or you can get started so um but it's like strategically I think the way we set it up and we have great Partners you know one of our partners is uh and is an operating genius and is a wizard in the spirits business can Austin so I gotta give him a shout out because I yeah he had another company right I mean he did Avion then he yeah probably does he's got a terramata now he's in the Lolo he's a he's a he's a Jeep when it comes to experience business you know and when you find people like that are you doing just like a like a 30 30 like you know you guys all split Equity evenly I can't go into the details of the cap table I wish I could but again the strong confidentiality Provisions in all agreement but it was a it's a fair deal and I think everybody's happy in the end but moreover you bring on a black belt that knows what they're doing because at the end of the day that's part of operating a business and being successful it's like you know what you don't know but essentially no matter what cap table looks like you're gonna make sure you bring on that the right expertise right from an operational perspective you have to have all the right ingredients to be able to execute successfully so even with something like that let's say uh just to put this in perspective is it the decision to say well we could just take a straight sponsorship deal get a check make a few Instagram posts and and you know cash that check um versus we're gonna do the entrepreneurial work and actually build a brand the payoff difference I imagine you could tell me from I think it's probably a hundred to one would that be approximate so like you know if you just say okay over a few years we would have a a kind of an alcohol sponsor and we're we're doing you know kind of these these scheduled posts with them or commercials with them or whatever it may be I think it's probably something like 50 to 100 x bigger return by doing the work is that I would say it's a more it's a multiple of that you think a few hundred dollars how much would a sponsor should have been I mean I mean back in that back at that time you know when we first started the process it would have been like 250 000 something like that that would have been a big one by the time we launched he probably was in the seven figure range yeah in terms of sponsor sponsorship annually right that's like an annual deal annual deal right yeah okay so a million some some Millions per year in order to promote yeah a whiskey versus hundreds of millions yeah exactly so I would say I would say like it was you know you could run any you know analysis even in an npv and look at like how we won and won big you talked about the Mayweather McGregor thing how that came to like how that nobody thought that that was going to happen and then it it actually happened and it was kind of amazing I remember vividly where I was I remember I was I was in Australia and I had to get up at a certain time I was at a bar at like five in the morning or something like that to watch that fight um but I also remember the build up like there was the kind of back and forth almost flirting on on social media talking talking trash to each other to try to generate interest because I think both guys Floyd and Conor are probably the two smartest businessmen ever that come through Combat Sports and they kind of knew okay this is the right dance partner from for us to like execute something orders of magnitude bigger than what we could do and um and I remember at the time it was seen as almost like the the Elon musk's Mark Zuckerberg thing today or it's like wow that'd be crazy if it happened but there's no way I mean just to get all these people to get them everyone to agree um seemed impossible can you take us back like uh you know like I see all these videos of you like hanging out at Connor's house or whatever and like you get you know the behind the scenes stuff there had to have been just like a couch conversation where you guys are like okay could we do this how could we do this what what was that early days like before it came to fruition so I to your point I think you know you have two of the smarter s and Savvy businessmen in Combat Sports that really understood you know the modern day fandom of both sports right and early days like he wants to do it and then it would be shot down by UFC by by members of the media by whoever that just doubted that it would ever happen um and I think that the the banter is really what allowed it to happen because once they started going back and forth and you could actually see the level of Engagement and interest from a market perspective and from a consumer perspective it was hard to deny it right it was hard to deny it because it was like this is real it's viable it's a it's a win-win scenario and a win for all parties should be involved why not right the fans want it the fighters want it and and moreover the numbers were speaking for themselves from an analytics perspective so that allowed us to really use what the two fighters were intelligently doing on a very instinctive level right there wasn't planned there wasn't scripted it was very instinctive but moreover I think what what my job is is to look at the data and be like right there's something very viable here there's something that you know you have to be able to take and continue to to Advocate and push for your client because you could effectively have a successful business opportunity even for the UFC and so that I think it took them a while to come around but eventually they did because they realized there was just such amazing and intense interest around this event that it was real it wasn't a gimmick it was something that everybody wanted to see and so I think that was uh credit to them too because again it went against all their their their normal business practice they'd never done something like that before and it took you know I think for them to see the substance of it all to then move forward with us and ultimately it was a huge success I mean over four million buys I mean I think there's probably there's a something there was some um report I remember receiving it was we had like hundreds of millions of illegal streams I mean like and we still did over 4 million buys you know what I mean like so could you imagine if like it was the most bootlegged fight ever yeah if we would have just been able to even just plug some of those holes and how many more buys we would have had right but I mean it was such a commercial success I mean can I ask you a quick question about those buys yeah so you said you said four million buys I'm not I'm not attacking this strictly about this fight but when I see pay-per-view numbers like what the headlines are I think most of them are complete I think that with a fighter says like for example I remember Floyd has multiple times said he's earned nine figures so 100 plus million off of one one fight and uh I think I think Connor say I think he was just talking but he's like oh I'm making this much money off this um uh cowboy Cerrone fight I think those are nonsense and the reason I think they're nonsense is it's almost like a rapper bragging about how much money they have it's like part of the brand you're not he's part of your brand and also no one's incentivized like Dana or Showtime or HBO they're not incentivized to like tell the public that yeah this dude's full of we gave him two million dollars he didn't earn 20 million dollars off this thing oh boy no look let me just look at that public information that's a loaded because there's certain elements of that you know could be hypothetically true but for example compensation is not fully reported when you're talking about UFC particularly MMA like but that's not fully reported what the persons really are at the highest level that yeah you know what I mean so so it's actually more it's even that true because I it's just what's reported to the commission and assuming that they don't have let's call it another agreement so that's actually in terms of pay-per-view there's a speculation so for example May Mac in particular There Was You know I think there was rumors that were starting to trickle in that it did over six million buys or something to that extent you know what I mean but it landed in like the four three four four range and that's that no that's actual right I mean ultimately you know that's those are not fudge numbers and so what you were hearing about what potentially uh Conor made and potentially Floyd made on our side I know it's more true on the Floyd's side I don't know if he divulges who he splits it with or if you know what that what that looks like on his side so I can't comment on on his right but UFC was our partner so I know what they're what we're reporting for kind of was Connor's what was reported I think was 30 to Connor and 100 to Floyd was that what was reported I don't think so but maybe I mean in terms of what you're talking about reported to the the commission of the papers no no journalist ever actually like breaks that down you know what I mean so that's what I'm saying like these numbers are so high and I hear that and I was walking around for I think it was hot for certainly higher for Conor that I know oh and and you know for Floyd I would imagine it would be probably around there or higher just depending on what he did again wow do you really think that 100 million was true well I mean I I Connor was on you know I'd say just under a hundred right when it's all said and done so and that's his part so again he has a part we had a partner in the UFC so and I won't get into the specifics but yeah so for Floyd's side it's very reasonable to think that he could have pulled in a hundred uh assuming that he he didn't take it all didn't have partnership but that's right you're a business guy so you see what Floyd did in the boxing business where he basically became his own promoter runs his own runs his own ship so that he can take the Lion's Share of of the the revenue or the profits that come from an event where like in the past guys like Mike Tyson and others sort of got screwed because they're out there fighting generating all this demand then they look at 10 years later they're like where's all the money and the promoter is basically enriched themselves in that way and obviously the UFC is totally different it's like a league it works differently but a guy like Connor is essentially as big of a brand as the USC or UFC uh like you know let's say it's debatable they're in the same like the same like air and if Conor McGregor was to go do a fight on YouTube pay-per-view or whatever he wanted to do he could pull the same numbers as a UFC card without the UFC's promotion do you think like I guess when you see what Floyd did do you think anybody's ever going to do that with the UFC or in MMA where they're going to become their own promoter and have their own shows I think the sport is still young and is still evolving right and while the UFC is to some extent synonymous to Lee is a promotion it's still structured to some extent you know like prize fighting right there's still pay-per-view and even though there's rankings sometimes you'll see the rankings are not it's not a true meritocracy because it's still prize fighting and entertainment to some extent right um and and I think that they have come a long way but they still have a long way to go in terms of how much Fighters should could earn should earn um but at the end of the day too from a boxing perspective I think that's why boxing has been on the decline it's still fragmented right and there's at the end of the day there's not uh a true promotion that's that's stood the test of time I know top ranks been around forever right but who do they really have matching seems to be doing more obviously Premiere is still around and still PBC still competing but you see it kind of fragmented right Canelo fight for matching one one for for a couple fights tonight fighting for PVC for a fight um and I and the difference is though I think in boxing promotions could fight each other and so they have to agree on that right I think in the MMA it's going to continue to evolve right you now have um the ability can Conor do that of course I think Connor is one of probably the only person could carry his own show it's very difficult to do right it's hard to go how many million pay-per-view sellers are there in either sport not a lot you know it's like it's it's not that easy to do so I think that from a from a UFC perspective they've always looked at it as like look we're we're building something that's sustainable and they are correct in that regard but I think that Fighters definitely should have a bigger uh piece of the revenues as this thing continues to grow which I think they've come a long way but they still have a long way to go right this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated well I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a test from three days ago I totally missed HubSpot grow better yeah I was going to say you know uh the other group that's trying to do their own shows is the kind of Jake Paul Logan Paul style thing where they're doing these kind of like kind of celebrity matches High interest uh fights and getting people to buy pay-per-views for that seems to honestly be working like you know like uh I don't know what you think about those guys but I personally used to be like oh you know kind of wrote them off as this like kind of like they were like in the jackass crowd of like the YouTube generation of the fine generation and then they said they were going to do this boxing thing uh let's see who knows how serious it'll take it but honestly like they've done a good job of actually like building up interest and pulling these events off and being like respectable showing up very respectably uh and winning several of these fights um you can't hate on them man you can't hate on them they're they're putting in the time actually our client Dylan Dennis is fighting Logan Paul coming up that's right Dylan Dennis is your client yeah oh my God that is so funny are you the genius behind his uh current marketing strategy is that your did you sign off on that no no that's all I'm doing um I thought you might have been his client there's there's a famous video where Nate Diaz and Dylan are getting into it and Nate throws a beer on Dylan and I saw you in the video trying to be like the the father in the whole like you're like hey Nate Dylan if you guys please walk away is that good it didn't work out my kids do it listen you know so um uh but no I you know you got to give those guys credit I mean look I think they're they're putting in time in their crash they're they're going in there and and they're not only you know taking a shot risk it you know I could argue that they're not really doing it against Real boxers that's true you know I think they're being more strategic and but you know again credit has to go to Connor right who created that Trend who started that it was less versus Mayweather and then now I mean even if Floyd goes and fights someone else he doesn't get the same result without it being another two two a side guys facing each other and well I give all of them credit too I don't think you've seen this Blockbuster event that anybody's been hoping for so so at the end of the day you know there's a market though there's an appetite from a consumer to go look at you know me and you Sean I don't I think we may look at 100 people that tune in but nonetheless there's a market there probably streaming on YouTube Sam is gonna have to pay he doesn't get it under you underestimate how many people want to see if we get my today my friend I think you're right you're right so what are the they've been begging to get Connor in that I think that that's the white whale that Jake Paul's chasing what is the percent chance that a fight between Conor McGregor and Jake Paul ever happens I mean right now College focused on Michael Chandler I'm saying I can tell you floor and exploit the rematches is there Logan Paul wants to fight him Jake Paul not as well of possibilities not zero yeah it's not zero it's just not top of mind right now right so you need to take up your sports jacket you need to have a proper 12 you need to like I want the non-polar politician answer that you you jizz are so good that's funny it's like I wonder if I just wore freaking Street wearing and you know and and dyed my hair and bleached my hair like I used to when I was a young punk rock kid you know if everybody would really just hear what I'm saying this D is not I'm just telling you the truth like if he's gonna fight Michael Chandler next right it's not and we're not thinking about that you know what I mean but ultimately of course we know he wants to fight of course we know it's there and of course I think if everybody keeps doing their thing it's gonna be a market for it right so well let's talk about the the biggest of these freak Show fights right now is Elon versus Zuck and it was one of those things that like in our world's like that's that's never happened in the kind of business and Tech world and then daily comes out and kind of certifies it he's like no they want it to happen we're talking to them we might make it happen which was yeah but he always does yeah well exactly it's Dana White so you never know uh but you know it was interesting that it got a little bit more heat from that what's your take on that and again same question I don't know if data would have gone on a limb if he hadn't really talked to both right I mean do they well I'm sure he talked to both but I don't I don't think that he would have done that you know and and even Zuck training with freaking you know a bunch of different Fighters Izzy and bulk and and Jon Jones and and then uh Elon bringing in GSP and do you believe it'll happen and if so I believe stuck would be down yeah catch weight whatever it doesn't matter I agree like I think Zuck is down Zuck is a is is is truly you know training and regardless of this fight or not he's in there does that mean you think Elon might not be down because that's our Theory here on this podcast is that Elon wants to talk about it look from the outside looking in and all the information that I have which is probably less than what you have being in the tech world you guys have some freaking secret telegram groups and who told you about that dude for knowing you or like knowing what I think of you you're probably gonna be managing them no I mean like hey I'll yeah I'm definitely gonna pursue them you know but so long as we get some rights not just transactions we got to build something together you know but I know but I I I think it's up to Elon I truly think it's up to you about you know and I don't know do you think Dana came out and said if it happened they probably looked at the numbers though for both X and threads they're like this is great yeah but zuck's more serious like no don't talk about it I saw those text exchanges and all that kind of stuff that kind of were leaked and like I said that's about it he's not he's not bullshitting you know Dana has said if it happens it would be the biggest fight ever he thinks it would surpass Floyd Pacquiao it would surpass Floyd Connor he thinks it would be that because it's just like uh you know the freak of all freak shows in that sense like it crosses over into so many different like fan bases or domains you get all the combat force people but you'd also get the business people to watch I think so I think so and I think it would also be the saddest fight ever yeah it'd also be really a lame to watch but it was actually it was it was actually it was actually kind of up the way Elon was all about it and then all of a sudden it's like it's not going to be to you on stage it's going to be charity like wait a second you can't play along all this time and then and then all of a sudden pull the rug you know what I mean like yeah did you see the video of him curling a 40 or he had like a 20 pound or 40 pound weight at his office and he did a live Twitter where he was he's like I'm curling to prepare it's like no dude I swear to God if you think doing curls at your desk is how you prepare you're this is not going to be good man you know oh I didn't see that that's funny that's hilarious dude I want to ask let me ask you about some other slick guys so basically a lot of people who don't watch the UFC they don't know that uh so Dana's the front guy you know he's doing a lot of the match setting and uh he does all the talking and he seems like a wonderful businessman but the Fertitta Brothers interests me most because they were uh I think I think Dana only owned like four or six percent of it when it sold but the Fertitta brothers owned most all of it besides some outside outside money because they were already wealthy but they seem like those guys they don't do a lot of interviews and they're a little bit behind the scenes they seem like sharks have you learned anything interesting from uh uh the two brothers and Dana uh about business well so obviously look the they sold their business now right Endeavor ended up yeah you know William Morris at the time they they bought it um but I I had uh pleasure of being able to to you know deal across from Lorenzo Fertitta on particularly uh on a couple clients particularly Connor obviously at that level um and they're very Savvy businessmen very very composed you know I I it's not it's the the dynamic when I'm on the opposite side naturally it's adversarial a lot of the time right and so um you know at the end of the day I'm advocating for my clients so it's it's I'm not their best friend right it's not like they're going to invite me over for Christmas and and uh but but we do have we did have a respectful relationship and I really really enjoyed dealing with someone you know that that has been not only successful in our Sport and the Pioneer in it but was a super successful businessman in the casino business and other businesses as well so you learn you learn from the interactions and the dealings and the negotiations that you're you're you're doing like for example when Mayweather McGregor it happened and we we basically got what we were leaving or striving for from a negotiation like Connor and I really we had that moment when we walked out of Lorenzo's office we're like you did it you know it was like a moment right and so do you guys like keep a straight face until you get to the parking lot yeah you get like Giddy and start hugging it well in the meeting in in the office you have the smirk you know you don't give it away right and then yeah when you get in the car yeah you celebrate you know um but yeah man I think it's the human I think that's what people don't realize I mean it's like it's the same in all sectors all sports and even the most composed person that doesn't do any interviews I'm sure I've had those moments in their own you know Journeys as well right I read on um front office Sports I think it's called it's like a sports publication that the final exit for uh proper 12 was 600 million dollars and I think that was only four years after you started it it's 600 million dollars in the ballpark three years and I can tell you you listen if it's probably printed then you've got to go with that because I can't necessarily comment on the specific numbers but we're still involved too it's not you know at the end of the day it's it's we we're still you know part of the team we're still pushing it to grow the brand we just came out with a news flavor our Irish Apple flavor which is amazing um you know dangerously amazing amazing too because I you know you just it drinks it goes down so easy uh but yeah man I'm super proud of that was that was that like a new level for you wealth wise and what I mean or were you able to make money a little bit along the way you know I think that was a whole nother level right that was a whole nother level where you're able to achieve you know your your your your your you know your ultimate goals right but ultimately too you're you're you're proving your content you know what I mean like ultimately like we're not having to go sell the platform we're creating liquidity events by creating opportunities um left and right not just for clients now we're creating Ventures that are you know creative to the platform we have a a smart basketball technology called hoop we have uh you know some other adventures in the pipeline that are coming out that are very very much focused on on advocacy for the entire Sport and creating something where we're putting our own capital in these things to create opportunities for everybody else right and so and and there's other things that we're creating specifically for our clients right so so you know in lieu of of uh of of of of you know having the opportunity to invest or you know an athlete not maybe not having the brand Equity to go start their own Venture how can we bring them along to ride with us you know for for the next Paw Patrol if you will right I always like to ask people this because I remember you know when you start out in business typically you have kind of nothing to your name and you've got this literally nothing credit card debt like exactly nothing so you start at zero or usually you go below zero you dip below zero for way below zero well the funny thing is and this is what people don't appreciate like my wife now she was my girlfriend and she had a job and we were literally maxed out credit cards and for the first seven years of Paradigm I didn't take a paycheck I was paying team members and staff before I was paying myself and I think people lose sign to that you know it's like but but then when you have huge success you still try to do right take care of people but even that's sometimes no good deed goes unpunished right but ultimately the it's a war of attrition you have to be able to withstand all of it and really believe in what you're doing and you know eat sandwiches daily right on your way there you're not a meeting at you you eat these sandwiches for in your case seven years in my case I remember like sort of eight or nine years straight of just uh like in my case it's just kind of failure but like in your case at least you're building it up um and then you finally have the moment where it's kind of like validated realize a Payday comes in you get a windfall along the way and like financially sure that's exciting and things change at a logical level but before it hits the logical level there's kind of the emotional level of like what does that feel like um what thoughts go through your head at that time we had a guy come on the Pod he's like dude I used to just every day for the next week I just drove to the bank and I would just go in the ATM put my card in and say print receipt because I just wanted to see it and he's always like I didn't even have anything James Hong he's like I didn't even have anything I wanted to spend it on he's like I was just amazed I was just amazing to look at that because I knew the seven year or whatever the the years that go into not not being there not having that and we had other people that are like you know this is oddly numb feeling I didn't feel anything and other people were like you know I had a conversation with myself I said all right now I'm here here's this pivotal conversation I had myself so I always like to ask people about that moment because I think there's usually something interesting that happens it's not just like just another day so it's surreal to me because you know on on one end it happened during covet so it was a real it was a weird time for all of us right and you know you you you you you you get there and honestly it's like you're pinching yourself and you know because it's a new age you don't have to necessarily go to the bank account to print the receipt anywhere you can just look at that I certainly did that a few times just like what you know uh but also like you have to make decisions like I we we hired more people we gave people raise we gave people bonuses that had nothing to do with them with that part of the business and and we invested back in the business and so I was first thing I bought was my mom my house and a car and so I like you know I I was trying to really you know stay grounded you know what I mean and more importantly like try to do right you know as best as you can um by for for those that are important to you both um family and on your team right and ultimately um still like just enjoy the moment and because we were kind of everybody locked in at home it was you know every night it was for my wife and I was just surreal and it's like you know then you start to think about okay well you tell your kids do you not how do you raise them the right way and how do you make sure you keep them hungry and humble and you know what I mean it's not about that and a lot of things change right because it's like you get there and you start to realize um you got to start planning thinking and and acting differently but then also other unintended issues start to come up you know like you know that was I forgot Mo Money Mo Problems is true you know at the end of the day uh what problems just a lot of different things I think people want people want people think that they deserve uh unappreciative people no matter what you give them you know they just unfortunately have a self-inflated view um you know I think there's there's a whole list of issues that come up with it right uh that's the reality but it is you gotta take the good the bad the ugly and just keep rolling punches and level up and level up and evolve that's what it is I thought you were gonna say you had a red panty night I was I was waiting for it that was the you said it for me I did and you had two bites of the apple right if I remember correctly like I think you guys did you guys sell a portion of the business early on and I think you sold half of it and then yeah another I don't know if it was the half or the rest or another big chunk yeah right yep was it a hard decision to sell or did you have 600 million reasons I mean it was I mean look any first of all it was an amazing at the time but I always ask the fact you're like now we still have we're still part of the business so we can still keep making a lot of money in in into the next decade or and longer you know at the end of the day um because uh it's always difficult to think about oh Woulda Shoulda Coulda right but you got to be able to count you know the fortunes of it all um you know and and be grounded and and that positive reality it's not a negative thing you know it's very easy to always Monday Morning Quarterback something like oh we shouldn't have sold because this this and now but you have those regrets which I think is normal by the way I think most people who no maybe most I think who they sell but you you all if you sell it right you tend to sell early right I mean that tends to happen I think I think the way we structured the deal allows us to really not only we made a ton of money but we just continue to make a ton of money and and you know ultimately have I had those thoughts sure you always think about it and because it's for me it's more so okay it's about execution right so not only did we execute but then how's how's the deal how's the terms how's this how's that you know so I'm kind of like constantly watching the film to make sure that I'm learning and growing as an entrepreneur because I'm not resting on my Laurels either I'm not done right and so I'm I'm still playing the game while you play the game you got to be able to not only celebrate the victories but watch the tape back and see where you could have gotten better right that's the only way you're going to be the best at what you do so I have a partner who a business partner who basically he was he was already successful before but his second company he was about to get a 200 million dollar check for the sale and it was a like a one of those like clickbaity websites on Facebook that showed like top 10 lists and then Facebook changed the algorithm and the sale sale dropped from 200 million to like 30 million and it was just a massive issue because of platform risk and there's a lot of fear of platform risk do you do you view Connor as like your platform risk like if he really because he gets in trouble uh sometimes and he gets accused of a lot of stuff sometimes maybe he actually did do it sometimes he didn't do it do you get nervous about platform risk with Conor of like if he does something really bad I'm I'm yeah well he's been accused of a lot of things and he's never been that's that's the the facts right uh but obviously there's always risk and everything and I think when you look at you know such a you know Connor's kind of like an enigma right so there's certainly going to be uh those that may be reverse and not want to do anything but at the end of the day whoever gets involved with us understands the McGregor brand right and understands inherent risks that potentially come with that but ultimately they also look at the track record and that is always going to win the day right because you could make all these claims accusation whatever but ultimately with the facts of the facts and the results are the results and the data is the data so I think when you look at all those things some of all parts is why we have a healthy relationship with all of our business partners and we continue to incubate and launch other exciting businesses and around the Connor brand for me he's the biggest client he's the he's also the top one percent you know pop culture brand in the world so it's like unless I go inside the other people in that small uh bucket if you will he's yeah he's always going to have uh you know that that let's call it you know uh proportionate risk value across my platform right but ultimately we're also you know much more than just one client and we're building something that for me is into the future right Sean do you see what happened with Barstool so basically Barstool Sports sold to a Betting Company a pen pen yeah and I don't remember the final sale 600 million plus Dave made a killing thank you guys stock nothing right a lot of stock yeah he got a lot of stock I think he got some uh I think he was able to sell some I know I know that the the on Wall Street you could see that he did sell a little bit and he um basically after three years pen was like you guys are insane like you're it's really hard for us to do like because we're regulated as a casino it's really hard to let you do what you want to do without hurting us and ESPN wants to do this big deal with us but they won't do it for with Barstool you know what Dave here look just have the company back and if you ever sell it again we get half of the profit cool and in exchange we're gonna do this ESPN deal which is going to boost our stock we're good it was like the the greatest coup of all time of like you know Dave getting uh Dave selling it and then them just saying here actually we don't want this uh you know maybe we have a world where the buyer of proper 12 is like hey this was cool and all but you know what you could just have it it's yours now yeah I think it was brilliant it's a great move for him and I think he still has pen stock too so then the stock goes up but he's winning again so good for him uh yeah that then that's a that's an interesting sector where we're getting ready to enter into it that's uh I'm interested to see what they do with it now right barstools and see what they end up through the end up you know partnering with to try to get that off the ground you probably I'm guessing you kind of studied other people who had Talent like this like I don't know if you're in a group chat with like Scooter Braun and like you know Don Shahidi or some of these guys that are managing you know the sort of the big scores those same top one percent kind of like people who can move the needle John's and John's of John's a friend I don't know scooter but John's a friend who's John what's his last name the guy who manages the health boys now um oh yeah yeah a dozen or so of some of the top podcasts and personalities you know he's a he's a he's certainly a entrepreneur I respect and he um and so you you kind of study them a little bit if somebody was studying you and they see what you're doing with Conor and how you built like I'm just gonna name them off so you did the Whiskey brand proper 12. you have Netflix documentaries and like entertainment that way you have Road House which is the new movie coming out you have the August McGregor the the suit lines you have title which is like the recovery spray you have the fast app which is like Fitness like app uh plus and I think like Jim's coming or whatever like you know something like that like a fitness brand that obviously fits there we have actually have a event based uh competition coming three called 3ko so that's gonna be you know think of of Spartan Race meets meets meets uh CrossFit Games you know very cool so you have that you have uh I think it's like a mobile game that he's in you do like kind of the the silver fight with Mayweather there's all these different things you've done around that person that brand and I'm sure some of them worked amazingly and some of them probably were too much work for what they were worth you just you learn as you go right you're not I doubt you were the one entrepreneur who just magically had everything right from day one no no way right so if somebody was studying you or somebody had you know it was it was hat was with the next McGregor was it with another star Creator would you what would be your kind of like advice to that person how would you advise them based on your learnings of the last 10 years of trying to figure this out yeah I mean first and foremost I'm still learning right I'm still learning I'm still growing what I would say is you know you have to be ready to uh you know not only dream but act on those dreams right and come prepared from a research and preparation perspective building out a plan and being fluid because it's not always going to go to plan right but if you're prepared and you do have a plan you're you're likely more you know you're likely to execute even if you have to deviate a little bit because you have to stay fluid with what reality hits you with right um You have to also have thick skin man like at the end of the day it's a war of attrition you're gonna eat sandwiches daily for a long time and so you got to be able to withstand that with a smile but be able to see through all the noise the pressure and more importantly have that ability to communicate with that with that client right because you guys have to stay in sync in terms of what you're building um I would say you know one of the things I wish I would have done build a team around you that's more experienced than you right because ultimately I think that that's what's going to allow you to accelerate your plan as opposed to Bringing people and then having to do other with other things like those people turning on you well what were one reason or not how big is the Paradigm team it's still Boutique so we're about 15 on the whole code level but then every brand Coast you will uh has has its own respective team right um and what I would also say is you know don't don't stop innovating right um don't stop trying to create new opportunities that have to align right with your client right organically but you got to make sure you're able to clearly Define that what's your criteria so like you've gone into these 10 different categories how do you pick which category to go into what what is it the line organically right and they have to have a genuine interest because you can't sell something that's fake I mean everybody thought and it's another thing everybody thought proper 12 was going to be a gimmick until they tried it obviously if you don't drink you don't drink but if you try it oh my God this is great make sure we created a substantive brand right it wasn't going to be just something that we just put his face on it and try to sell and that's important I know to him as well and that's why he believes in in in the ventures that that that that he's involved with he's very passive but it's they're of substance as well they're quality so you have to understand the market you have to understand the players in the market you have to understand how you fit in or how you can disrupt the marketing grab market share and you have to put a plan together that allows you to to have a higher probability of success with the black belts that are going to help you operate the business you know and then having all the other components that making sure that you could actually build a product or service or substance by the way did you ever consider just putting his name on it it's like you have like uh Jameson or Johnny Walker or Jack Daniels like McGregor's name is so famous it's interesting decisions they actually take it's taken I did think about that there's a the McGregor Clan I think it's the scotch I'm not mistaken so that that was certainly considered we we also considered notorious Irish whiskey at one point right um and and you know again even early earlier days a couple other things that were floated around but no proper 12's a good name Paw Patrol is good again what's it mean like the choice is it like the 12 districts of like Dublin Dublin 12. so each let's call it yeah Borough or city within Dublin is is a number and where he's from is Dublin 12. and so and proper I mean they always say that was a proper night out you know like oh it's proper good time and um so it's you know proper number 12. that just made sense for the brand and again after pivoting several groups and finding the right Partners you know we came up with the brand together and Sean and I are big fans of of words you know like we'll hear someone say something and we're like oh man the language they used was beautiful that was really good language whether it's writing or just someone talking the cool thing about Connors he he's got a beautiful vocabulary and beautiful timing and beautiful phrasing so he uses wonderful words and so like I remember when he was fighting Jose Aldo he would talk about like he was like if this was another time I would storm your pavilla and then he like talks about like what he would do to the and uh like he like you know the whole red panty night like he just has like really funny catchy phrases I guess Trump kind of did this too where he just like it was just really catchy stuff are you guys ever just shooting the and you're like oh that's a line we're going to we're gonna have to use that um very natural and going back to the Acumen I mean that is stuff that it's not rehearsed it's very much stuff that he just comes up with but we'd be there and he'd say some stuff like that was hilarious that's another that's another mcgregor-ism you know what I mean like you're like put that in the bank use that one I have two fan service questions that are around that number one yeah well during the Mayweather press tour uh which was just like that was that was so much fun but it looked like because all UFC press tours are the same you go you sit and they ask you questions and then you react whereas that one was like stand up and give a speech and it almost looked like Conor was almost ambushed like oh I just got to give a 20-minute improvised speech in front of millions of people right now and then they kind of did it was that an ambush I always wondered yeah no idea what the format was going to be like and Sam yes it was exactly at the time but just thinking back to it every time it kind of comes up from whether it's the annual anniversary whatever it may be it was such a great experience man and it was like once in a lifetime thing because you know Sean there was no format that's your point I don't know if you felt ambushed but certainly we're like oh what how is it for this one how is it for that one right but the energy of all of them was out of this world and so I think that they fed off that energy which gave them the ability to deliver these legendary lines and answered back and forth I remember watching it and it was clear that he was like wait there's no questions I just have to I just have have to go okay I'm a comedian now all right bet and he said this line he goes you know they they've tried everything they didn't tell us the format my microphone doesn't work they're trying to put me in a uncomfortable situation but they don't know I thrive in uncomfortable situations I almost feel like he was giving himself a pep talk during the speech I I really loved that line that was that was great but I also have another kind of fan service question on almost the other side of the coin so as you can tell me and Sam both fans of you of the UFC of Conor like we really it'll take a lot of inspiration from some of the you know it's just a badass thing to go out there and just fight and and put yourself on the line like that every single time there's something to be admired with that for sure and I think Conor came in with a very uh like at the beginning how could you hate the guy like he was he was bold he came from nowhere he was like you know this guy who was like a you know Apprentice plumber and then was like all of a sudden beating everybody exactly this way he said he would his fighting style was electric like there was nothing to dislike about the guy I thought on the on the come up uh I'm sure some people did but like the majority of fans I think were were on the come up were just like this guy's incredible and then there's sort of almost like a heel turn now where um I know a lot of people who I watch fights with they sort of feel like he's kind of jumped the shark like oh you know now he's this like first of all she's like super jacked now in this huge way he's like more of a boxer he's he hasn't fought in a long time you know he talks tracking maybe he's crossing the line too much oh he's getting in trouble like there's all these things honestly like I know he's your client and he's your friend and you're probably never gonna say a bad word about it but I think there are some Fair criticisms that like you know it's understandable why somebody who was a super fan might now feel like ah you know I can't really you know get behind everything that I'm that I'm seeing here um do you think about that at all and do you uh I guess like what's your reaction to that I I don't really know how to phrase the question but I feel like you're one of the few people on Earth who would have an opinion about this that I would really care to hear I mean look it's just like you are engaged with these conversations naturally I'm gonna hear everything right from people around me and you know whether it's my friends whether it's family and ultimately what I'll say is this like you know everybody's entitled to their own opinion I know who the person is and obviously I I do have an intimate relationship it's something that's more than just transactionals more than just a client a business partner someone that I I'm I'm loyal Tunes been loyal to me and so at the end of the day you know I know that history once it's done being written will be interpreted by everybody differently he's definitely not perfect he's definitely made mistakes but a lot of the criticism too is subjective it's based on where where you stand and what you believe in or what you want to see Etc but AKA never been legally all those accusations have not been legally found to be true right B it was the cleanest and the most tested athlete before he got out of these shadow pool and when he returns to fighting he's going to do it the right way and everything's going to be legal so everybody can say what they want to say there's nothing that was done wrong right and so he's he's constantly being vilified because ultimately the stuff that they love them for he still does the all outspoken they'll says what's on the top of his mind but maybe because he has the riches now and it's not the rags anymore sometimes we try to tear some people down I don't know why I can't tell you right but ultimately I do know proofs in the puddin he has to continue to go out there and show that he could continue to evolve be the best version of himself not just athletically but as a human being as well and ultimately that's on him to do and I can't do that for him you can't do that for him but criticism is going to come and when you're when you're in the public eye you got to be ready to to take it on and at the end of the day Heavy's the head that wears the crown you can't just want the good and not take the bad with it so ultimately that's something that we constantly talk about something that I know he says I say to him we talk about he understands that but it doesn't make it easy it doesn't make it easy because ultimately at least like you know you know you talk about that that aha moment I don't know how many entrepreneurs you've had on this podcast but when they have that big moment they don't need to be seen by everybody they're probably enjoying it with nobody watching them or if they go somewhere nobody really recognizing who they are right myself included so ultimately it's very desperate and um that doesn't you know you can essentially absolve him of the responsibility that he has to take upon himself in certain instances but more importantly it makes me understand pressure is real not only to win and succeed but on another level to live your life so visibly for everybody to just critique every little thing in today's world man everybody has an opinion you know you guys before you met me you thought I was a square suit because of how I appeared physically visually to you without ever talking to me before right so it's like very easy than fast judgment based on whatever your belief system is how you're raised your experiences with someone that look like me whatever it may be or your opinions of Agents just because you watch Entourage and parlors but I I can't change that ultimately right and so when you live in today's world like that for everybody to critique man it's gonna come with now just the good but the bad the ugly as well you got to deal with it I like the fan questions you know this is it's fun we've had Ariel hawani on here uh you know we've become friendly with Ben asper and I think we've talked to Mike Mike Bisping we've talked to a bunch of folks it's uh you know Sean and I are super fans so it's always fun to like get like The Insider how many fights have you guys been to in person I've only been to three or four the the the in-person event is definitely like the best in-person sporting event but in my opinion if you're like a uh like a a nerd and a fan fan it's so much better to hear the commentary and to see it on uh and just like to see like the replay of the Sean Malley uh knockout uh on Saturday like it was really awesome to be able to like see it close up you know one challenge with UFC which is that the cage and the cameraman on every post of the cage does kind of screw up the viewing experience depending on where you're at like I'm sure if you're right next to right ringside it maybe you don't have that issue but like we went to one event at the the Vegas Place uh the one where um mosvidol need Aspirin into like you know you know the next realm and uh and you know the guy I saw it but the guy next to me like literally couldn't even see the thing he missed the moment because it was like a split it was like in the first five seconds of the fight and secondly like you know just because of a cage like if you go to a football game or a basketball game it's open field it's you know it's very easy to see what's going on whereas you're almost watching on the dumbotron well it's interesting first of all I think look there are pros and cons to your both your points the energy of a big fights is something else it's electric I mean just the walkouts and the crowd and you steal it and then you hear the thuds and you know it's like it's it's pretty pretty amazing I was at uh Jorge and Nate and it was like spectacular right it just it's just nice to be able to like you got to go home and watch it again yeah yeah but then from A View perspective to your point unless you're like the first few rows of the floor it's actually that the the the mid low Riser which is the perfect view because you're looking into the Octagon but you're still really fairly close and I think that's the best you live right but um nonetheless no matter where your seats are I think for big big events you the the electricity of that place is something else you know so what's gonna happen like I'm following this whole circus with Dylan danis and Logan I have I've never even seen Dylan Danish train I went and watched his two Bellator fights but that was like years ago what's gonna happen like I don't know I've never even seen Spar or anything on like leading up videos what's gonna happen uh on that one said August it's August 14th Logan is is obviously has a uh uh a leg up having you know box before right yeah that was years ago I think he's bigger no listen listen I I get it uh uh you know the fight's actually scheduled October 14th but but oh October Dylan has made all the necessary necessary adjustments to his life to his preparation but this is his boxing debut so he has to go in there and really prove it right now I could tell you the banter that's going back and forth I mean you know he's confident in his abilities and he's definitely putting in the work so ultimately you don't you don't make you know you don't take that position with the banter that he's doing if you're not going in there with some level of confidence in yourself right so and and I and I'm sure it's giving Logan a little bit more training for it right because ultimately it's it's personal now I would imagine right um oh yeah not even Conor you know king of Trash Talk counter wouldn't even he never even went that far uh to talk about family I don't like that he's talking about family but I like it in the sense of like I'm gonna stare at it I have a kid on the internet and I think it's funny too you know yeah yeah like it's too far but at the same time like but it's there you know what I mean I'm watching that I think what's interesting is the you know love it or hate it the engagement for that is through the roof and you know it should help show the fight and more importantly like it's about now performing right because ultimately you can talk all you want now you got to go on the phone but he's made all the adjustments to his life personally professionally which which I'm very proud of him for doing that will give him that that high chance of winning this I think he's gonna yes and shock a lot of people people are not giving him enough credit I think when he gets in there it's it's just time to shine now he's putting he's gonna put he's gonna basically put his money where his mouth is because the mouth is getting it ready is going to make people want to watch him love him right well you're you're kind of implying you're like well it doesn't matter unless he loses and uh I kind of disagree I think uh I think he's already won whether he loses or or not like he's he's already kind of like from where he was starting to where he is now like you know he's already gotten he'll be okay he'll even if he gets knocked out right away he'll probably be better off than where he was oh this is a great opportunity for him no doubt no doubt thanks for doing this man uh where should people follow you if they want to get more just uh my first and last name at auditar Twitter Instagram threads sorry yeah sorry yeah at audience audience threads audiot Instagram I think one of three still remain all right Audi thanks for doing this man all right just Sean Sam thank you so much appreciate it and that's the pod [Music]

yes in the early days I saved everything I mean I did not buy a bed until I got married dude just to put in perspective even when we were dating no there's no bed [Music] [Laughter] [Music] what up dude this is a long time in the making episode here I think we've been talking about you for like two years I think you told us you're like hey hey guys don't put me on blast like this uh we were like you got to come on the show you're like nah you're just gonna ask me how much money's in my pocket right now and I don't know if I want to do that but somehow some way we convince you to come on Saeed bulky you're here uh first why did you just change your mind how did you decide to come on you know I was talking with Sam over Twitter DM and that's how it happened well what I told you a lot of people think that Sean and I are like really aggressive about questions but what they don't realize is like we'll ask an aggressive question but if you say I don't want to talk about that we just go all right cool we'll we'll move on like we're not like digging that hard uh so hopefully that changed your opinion that did that did so side you're kind of an amazing guy so let me just set the table here for people let me just give you a little let me just tease everybody with the appetizer so I think you are one you've done something that I don't even know five other people on Earth who have done what you've done which is that you've basically bootstrapped a unicorn you've bootstrapped a billion dollar company um you've done it you're only 32 years old so you did this by 32. you also didn't like invent the next big thing it's not like you did this because you're Super Genius you know you're not you didn't you're not like a you know vitalik you know creating ethereum on the blockchain or something crazy like that like you just did a very specific set of like prudent smart actions and it just added up in an amazing way we're gonna talk about it um but also I didn't know [ __ ] about you Sam's known you for a little while he brought you up on the Pod a while back he goes I know this guy or I met this guy he's really interesting he does this WordPress stuff have you seen him and I was like no we went to your personal website I don't know if you ever got this clip but like way back in the day we went to your personal website we were talking about you but we didn't know too much then we do Camp MFM which is my my basketball fantasy camp we're invited like 25 other Founders and we had an NBA guy come basically treat us like we were you know Pretend We're a pro for the weekend and uh when we were there there's so many people to get to know again I didn't really get to know everybody at the same time but then Mr Beast did something amazing so one night we were all in the kitchen basically we're all hungry after basketball and Mr Beast just sets a chair in the middle of the middle of the room and he goes I don't know whoever you guys are because he's like if we've just been playing basketball all day and now I'm curious like who the hell are you guys you Tech nerds basically uh and he's like sit out of this chair you sit down and then he would just interrogate that person be like all right what do you do who are you all right how does that work is that big what's your dream okay cool and then he would like go to the next person and I think you were maybe the third or fourth person in the hot seat and I was like oh this is great I actually don't know too much of science story and then you just blew us away you blew us away your story was so good Mr Beast was while he was interrogating you I thought um it was just like the perfect interview if we had just recorded that podcast I would have been happy so we're just gonna try to recreate that moment right now well inside you you were the one of the quieter more humbler people there and probably the most impressive in terms of like traditional business uh accomplishments and it was very fascinating what you've done I basically heard about you through my friend Neville midora and what I know about you is that you had this blog called wpbeginner which wrote really uh a ton of articles some of it really simple like how do I set up a WordPress site and I think that ended up getting or it still does has a ton of traffic and then if I remember correctly and this is just from an outside perspective you'll have to tell me if I'm right or wrong you basically started buying different WordPress plugins that I imagine you saw were popular on your blog so it was like how do I set up um a form to capture emails on my WordPress blog and you it probably got lots of traffic and you're like oh I should just go buy one of these or here are the best here are the five best plugins for this thing or here's the five best themes and if you put your cursor over the links on wpbeginner you'll see which of the links are affiliate and I just I'm guessing that like of the top five let's say forms for WordPress based off the URL you own like three of the top five and through that you've like built this into a business by the way you've never told me I'm just guessing that makes high tens of millions of dollars in Revenue no no Sam not tens of not tens of Millions nine figures of Revenue over 100 million dollars of Revenue oh I did not know that okay wow so just to paint the picture here you have uh WP engine and we'll talk about how you're sorry WP beginner so WP beginner and we'll talk about how you got to that but that's the content site that's just providing free help you know content to other people like you who are trying to make sites in the WordPress ecosystem that's the the Mainstay and so I'll draw an analogy here because uh we've had Andrew Wilkinson on the Pod I don't know a dozen times or something he's probably one of the most famous guests and most uh favorite guests of the audience of of our community so um you have a business that's a lot like his he's got a portfolio of companies you've got a portfolio of companies he had meta lab which was kind of his like Core Business Cash Cow thing that allowed him to buy these others you had your uh your WordPress site that the the content site that was your core engine um in but I think you've actually done I think your model actually might be a little bit better that's no knock on Andrew it's just to get people excited here so basically you I think have a more like one ecosystem you're like okay I'm gonna like dominate this WordPress ecosystem and the good thing is that WordPress I think power is like 30 or 40 of all websites so it's you know it's huge it's basically like you know a huge chunk of the internet um and then all your stuff fits together so you you know you have one customer they're trying to you know uh make a successful website and grow and and solve other problems you're like great I have the content that will help you then I have the tools that'll help you and you either buy them or you build them and you've created this portfolio that now does you know nine figures of Revenue probably worth a billion dollars you own the whole thing yourself with no no outside investors you're only 32 years old uh you know you've built kind of an amazing thing so that's the just to sketch out like the blueprint here for what what you've done um Sam does that do you think would you add anything to that description well then there's all his side hobby stuff which like I read his annual report and he's like I bought a gas station or I bought like eight or ten gas stations so that's like a whole another conversation but yeah that that's that's let's do a quick thing on the on the origin story so that people people have it you told me once on the phone you said I think you were doing consulting or something you had like an agency you're like I was helping people make websites and I was building like crms or whatever for them and then WordPress came out I was like oh this is way better they should they should be using Wordpress you started to help it you just were a service agency right and then you started then WordPress became your your core service and then you're like okay I'm just gonna help people make WordPress uh sites for their business is that right pretty much so remember uh the very first websites that I built were online proxies because I wanted to play games in school um and I was making ad revenue on proxies and some arcade TurnKey sites and I was helping small other you know local businesses set up their websites I tried making my own CMS uh with PHP by the way I can code I'm not the best at it I would say now I probably suck at it and what age what what what age was this 13 14 um so so I would I would build these websites super cheap call it like 250 300 that would make you a website uh back in the day and but what happened is that these clients would always rely on me to make changes to it changes to the websites and as I started doing consulting at a bigger scale um I didn't want to do this uh the small and small endings so and I discovered WordPress around this time this was 2006. uh and I said WordPress was only an Inception for three years so WordPress started in 2003 so I discovered it in 2006 to to put in perspective I've been I'm 32 now I've been in WordPress half of my life you know this is the result is compounding in one thing for half of my Life by the way you're 13 14 doing this are you like at the dinner table at night being like uh my clients are pain in the ass right now mom like you know what are you saying at home and also how are these people finding you are they coming to your middle school and you're handing out flyers what's going on no no no no so we moved from Pakistan to us when I was 12. okay my dad had the mechanical engineering degree but it did not validate when he came to us so he was working 16 hours a day as a gas station clerk attendant you know just swiping things 16 hours a day kid you not every day Monday to Friday and on the weekend he had his third job so I didn't really see my dad uh my mom was busy because there's three of us and the fourth one on the way right so my youngest brother was born in U.S so there was not many dinner conversations happening um I wanted to figure out a way to have some chunk of change in my pocket so I can buy junk food like Mountain Dew and Kit Kat and Snickers and all the [ __ ] that you buy it when you're in high school dude your dad was at the gas station man you had the hookup you just uh you just needed to ask [Laughter] my dad would never do that by the way you went to high school at age 12 also right yeah I started so I moved here I had just finished seventh grade in Pakistan and I came here in March so this this two-month Gap the school system is like well we can put you in eighth grade worst case scenario you'll repeat 8th grade because that's where you're supposed to be in anyways but our education system in Pakistan is far better than the one we have here in U.S so they're like you can go to high school so I'm like 12 in high school the youngest person in school I did not speak English that well um I would say probably very little English I knew how to read English because we were thought alphabets and such but my communication skills were not there um so yeah that was that was a pretty challenging time for me and I spent most of the time in the library during lunch time I was in the library and I wanted to play games because I'm like I can't talk to humans so I would just play on the computer and those game sites were blocked I'm like how do you unblock this thing and that you know drove me down in terms of how I was getting clients it was through these forums online right so you had forums like DN Forum digital point name Pros a bunch of these you know OG communities online where you can get you know business and my cousin got me into one of those they don't know you're 13. you're just a guy in a forum no yeah well like so we had like a family friend who needed a website and you know they had a bit local business they knew how old I was and they're like oh you can do it and I'll pay you 300 to build my website I'm like okay sounds good and then you know that's how that that funnel started so you do insights you're trying to make your own CMS you discover WordPress you're like oh this is way better here's a CMS out of the box uh what's what becomes the aha moment and uh when do you create the blog so had had discovered WordPress moved these clients over I had affiliate sites I was doing affiliate promos at the time I was discovering this um I had directories that I was telling you about earlier that um so I wanted to get more traffic so I had these I created these Myspace profiles they were fake profiles um and got hundreds of thousands of followers and I would send both you know DMS equivalent which were called bulletins on MySpace right so I just wanted more traffic and I went down the rabbit hole of SEO which brought me to Wordpress and and then because WordPress was Dynamic content so I added the blogs to the directories started using uh WordPress for the clients and I had the social media profiles uh on dig and stumble upon never superpower users and such and essentially when I wanted to get rid of this business the Consulting business I wanted to figure out how how do you do this I asked other agency owners and they're like well you know we just had these PDFs that we give to our clients and I'm like but WordPress updates all the time how do you keep those PDFs updated and they're like oh no we uh we updated the PDF I'm like that's dumb you should use WordPress to update those documentation so essentially wpbeginner started that way it was The Unofficial documentation for WordPress now WordPress had documentation but it was it was written for developers by developers nothing was for business owners and began what year was this 2009 well one good point here is that that's now six years after WordPress started and you're making the beginner site and there really wasn't a great one most people I think uh there's a lesson I've seen many many times as we talked to different guests which is and sometimes you feel like you're late but you're rarely ever actually late to the wave and uh Kevin vand Trump told us this one time he goes for all the best things you always get it was a second turn to get on the train like uh you feel like you're late you feel like you missed it but often uh you're not you're not that late actually don't talk yourself out of it there's almost always another another chance to hop on it look according to similar web right now you get like two or three million visits a month the early website shockingly doesn't look significantly different than how it looks now you kind of nailed it right out the gate it's like it was a simple website um where you just have articles about picking the right name how to install WordPress selecting the right theme picking the right web hosting but were you writing this stuff because I know you're in English as a second language person so were you are you actually writing these articles because a lot of them are long like look 55 of the Most Wanted WordPress tips tricks and hacks yeah like these are like pretty like in-depth articles as well as you're playing the game of SEO and like you clearly understand like English yeah no by by this time I was already in college right so I started high school at 12 started college at 16. by that time my English had gotten uh much much better so I was writing uh these articles on wpbeginner I had a team um of two other people that were helping me uh with with the website the website looks similar now and what it was in 2009 there was a period when when I changed it and there was a mistake people you know I changed the color scheme too much and the audience were like they didn't resonate with it so I changed it all back uh and haven't changed it since then because the big lesson was you know big companies don't really change their stuff because they know if it's working don't you know break it if it's not broke don't fix it don't interrupt compounding unnecessarily as Charlie Munger says uh so I made it go back to what it looks like and it's been that way since 2012. and what tools do you use to figure out well because I I imagine most of these articles are you're writing them based off of what people are searching for is that right yes uh it's a combination of that and what they're asking us through our contact form what they're asking us in our Facebook group I think our Facebook group has probably over 90 000 members um and support requests are coming so yes we have our own keyword generator if you go on WP beginners kind of hidden on the free tools page it's a keyword generator and you can put in anything in there like WordPress and we'll tell you what people are searching for um and do you have a lot of comments early on June in 2010 a year or two after starting you already had 26 responses on just I just clicked on a random article so you're like getting traction yeah so a couple of things happen that that worked out for me one do you guys remember dig.com yeah it was it was really popular so I had a power user profile there so what I like if one out of two articles that I would submit would hit the front page so of course I use that to my benefit and I use that Network to my benefits of your profile because uh there was there was legitimate ways and illegitimate ways to do that I'm curious how did you end up having that it's just a Social Circle right so there's these engagement pods that that you go on and back back in the day was on MSN Messenger and well um Aim so so we just had the engagement pods so if I submit something like you know it was a group chat and everybody would jump dump their items in there and you would upload it so say I was the engagement pod and and what year did this did WP beginner cross a million in Revenue in annual revenue how long did how long did that take maybe a year and a half or so oh damn you crushed it right away yeah so you know we had a good Revenue stream so let's let me take a step back so there was this business and the listicle business so collectively past a million uh in a year and a half so about 2011 2012. and so your early 20s uh basically at that stage you're a millionaire um that was my first million how does that feel you said you grew up your parent you know your dad worked you told me you were like yeah my dad worked at a gas station and I thought Pakistani guy says gas station I know you own gas stations I was like oh so your family owned gases you go no no he sat in the gas station he swiped the cards in the gas station uh and you were like everybody in my family I knew you were either you worked at a gas station or you're like oh you're you're real smart like you get to be a bank teller and that's all you knew in your bubble so tell me two things how did you get because you got to kind of see the possibility of being a business person or being wealthy before you're going to even do it uh so how did that happen and how did it feel when like the name of the podcast my first meal I'm curious how did it feel when that first happened what was do you remember your reaction yeah so I'll tell you how it how I knew it was possible so I used to play cricket um which if you have a lot of listeners in Pakistan and India you know they love Cricket We love I love cricket so I was playing cricket and there are many leagues in U.S and South Florida there was one and there's many now too I met this Pakistani gentleman and he was the sponsor for her team he's a crazy qriket fanatic and he became my mentor and now he's a family friend um but back then I just see this Pakistani guy you know driving a S-Class and you know just super humble super nice and I'm like what do you do are you like born into money or was it what's your Spiel I was pretty blunt as a kid um so so he's like no I have real estate I came to the US with like 500 in my pocket or 100 in my pocket you know those typical immigrant story uh and then he you know after we'd win the games he would take us out to eat sometimes he'll invite us all to his house which is like you know big Mega Mansion right you know 15 18 000 square foot house um and his kids were my age so we'll just kind of go over to his house hang out sometimes he would go over to his house to watch cricket games because they're happening on the other side of the world so time zones are different and in between breaks I was the one who took interest in his business you know and his kids were all roaming around but I was I'm like tell me how this works tell me how this works right so he would tell me stories like oh this is how I took over a Burger King for free or this is how I did this and this is how I started so I I absorbed a lot of the earlier lessons on business finance just hustle from him right and he was always super encouraging to ask me how's this going how you know and I felt like I could talk to him about it so that's that was the early stage of me knowing oh this is possible because nobody in my family uh had any any wealth uh they were just working at gas stations all my uncles everybody and if you're really smart you're working at the teller at the bank um so so that was the motivation part in terms of how it felt when I hit my first million you know you would think it would be like the joyous moment of oh my God look at this I was more scared than than uh than anything because I was is this gonna is this Gonna Last that's the question that you have you know in your 20s you're like you come from nothing and you have this thing you're like is this going to last forever like what what is the what am I supposed to be doing I have no guidance so there was like this inherent fear so I always lived below my means like way way way below I mean so when I was in college I uh I did not buy any furniture I just slept on the floor on a blanket because I mean that's how I grew up in Pakistan so I'm just like I'm not gonna buy any furniture why why waste time and money with this so in my in my apartment I had a blanket and I got a desk from Goodwill so that's what I worked on hahaha and and I mean what's amazing is you said I would have thought the first million came sooner than 2012 but because in 10 years you've thrown that from one to 100 plus or whatever it is when were the inflection points where you were like all right blogging is cool and it's working yes uh let's get Beyond yeah so I launched opt-in monster in uh 2013 list 25 in 2011. um these things started really cranking I had some really sweetheart affiliate deals with certain companies um that worked out really really well for me and so that was good in that time you know we were coming out of the economy the recession so real there's still like some real estate deals to be had so I bought my gas station the first one primarily because I wanted to offset uh offset expenses with an appreciating asset which was the lesson I learned from my mentor right yeah let's let's talk about that one real quick so just do a quick quick little monologue on why did you buy a gas station when you found out you're having a kid so one of the things I learned from my mentor early on I was like how do you how do you like justify buying a Mercedes because that's a depreciating asset and he's like yeah but you know when I drive in this people think of me better like you know there's the impression game Etc and how I justify it is I buy something that's an appreciating asset like real estate and I just use the income from that to us pay my lease payment so my principal never disappears and I was like that's a good idea your principal continues to appreciate and you're using something uh you know the income from it to offset and it also helps you stay disciplined because you're not gonna go you know overspend your money because normally when you get a raise or something like this everybody just thinks in monthly payments so this takes you away from the monthly payments mindset into thinking a little bit bigger so when I was about to have my son uh I was 26 by this time guys like I was I was doing all right you know I I had all these VC firms reaching out me you know I I could I could have had a a solid eight-figure exit like you know two or high eight figure eggs that I had offers for that at the time and I'm just like high eight figures as in as in 90. I was in 70 at the time 70. for the for WP beginner no no I had opted monster at the time and I had uh uh the gallery solution at the time and I had uh I had WP forms I had analytics so were you close to taking it and how did you decide not to yeah I I I definitely thought about it but then I was like what would I do afterwards like my son is gonna you know grow up seeing me not work because I'm like I'll be stuck with that bunny right like I would not I would not go do anything if you I mean if you have 10 million dollars 20 million dollars you put it in the bank and you're like hey this this is it I wanna but you're gonna have a lot more yeah I was gonna have a lot more than that that's that's what I'm saying even after paying taxes I I would have a lot more than I would be set so the the the the factor that my wife and I talked about was what instill my work ethic was watching my dad work and I wanted my son to at least see that right what was the what was the multiple on that for to get to 70 million is it as high as 10x multiple at that time um no it it was lower than that so so you turn that down and I turned that down you turned it down was it really you've turned it down because you were like I want my son to see me work yeah and also I didn't I wasn't ready to give up my baby okay and uh okay so fair enough so you you um basically so here's the thing so so at this time my son is about to be born and I'm like okay how much does a baby cost right like what what are the cause of this baby and you're like okay well you know you're gonna have diapers you're gonna have you know schooling and this and that and I'm like well no if I buy something that gives me at least five or six grand a month nothing that um and then the baby costs are covered first so like you know it's gonna give me 60 to 70 000 a year um and now I don't have to think about it and my family is taken care of no matter what happens to me so yeah that's that's what I I got for our baby shower most people take the money they make and then they're like all right that's what I have to spend and they spend it what you do from your Mentor is you take the money you make that has to now go to buy an appreciating asset that will spit off cash flow you and then you could spend whatever that one makes so it's kind of like a a savings program basically um so you you spend what the you go by the gas station the gas station's gonna pay you and you're like that will pay uh for this child you know like I'm gonna provide my I'm not going to provide my for my family this gas station is going to provide for my family I want to put food on the table dude it allows me to want sleep better at night and to be more bullish in the deals than I'm doing how many gas stations you have now ten and you own a bank too I I bought a bank yes in Wells Fargo Wells Fargo because you have a cool blog post where you're like uh I used to go to this Bank all the time and I decided to buy it this year yeah I used to ride my bicycle around it I couldn't even go to the bank I didn't have a bank out of time I used to ride my bicycle around the bank because there was a Sports Authority there and Office Depot there uh just like ride my bike into that and then I bought that building what amazes me is is how like I don't know if you're similar web estimates are right but can do you say what your monthly traffic is on wpbeginner no but you know it's it's in the millions okay so let's just let's just assume that similar web is roughly correct two to five million we'll give it a huge range a month that's a lot that's not that much like what's crazy to me is that I mean that's high intent traffic it's likely people who are coming for to buy something like they want to in the email software so they're coming for a review it's just amazing to me that that much traffic has created so much value I think when you start um your online business most people think about maybe a CPM model of monetization or a CPC model of monetization there is far there are other and better models of monetization right um you can have cpls you can have CPA you can have a combination of CPL CPA you can have recurring you know uh commission you're talking about uh CPM meaning just uh ten dollars per 1000 visitors for display ad versus cost per lead or cost per acquisition which is someone buys something they give you a hundred dollars per month if it's a MailChimp and it's someone's paying 500 a month they'll say all right you get a hundred dollars per month while they're a customer correct and there are verticals that are not available on wpbeginner because remember I was telling you I I did a lot of affiliate marketing as well um there are articles that will pay you on a lead basis and hundreds of dollars just for a lead not for not for a commission like as an affiliate not like you made a sale just to lead we'll get you hundreds of dollars and and so so I did a lot of those um and I still do so that's that's a good Cash Cow um so those verticals are available where you can go and promote something and get over 100 an elite has the wp beginner Revenue grown like the rest of the business or is that just like you're like I'm I'm perfectly fine with it just being a steady 10 or 15 million dollar a year thing and I use I bet you it's super profitable I'm looking at your team page I would bet you make 50 profit or something crazy and you're like I'm just gonna take that profit and buy more stuff and I'm okay with that being steady pretty much you know on a Content business you cannot compound it as much you know eventually what what happens is you will hit the traffic Mass that you hit um and you can unlock as many levers as you can but the compounding will stop because it's a reoccurring Revenue you know like the person that I referred this year weird or something it's not going to compound next year I'm not going to get that plus new customers which is what happened in a software business which is recurring Revenue so yes your assumption is right that while WP beginner has grown it hasn't grown at the same Pace as the software companies and that's like a very big you know mental shift in between recurring revenue and reoccurring revenue for all the creators that are listening um because once you understand that you'll start thinking about your business a little differently so I I took all of our profits and invested in um you know software and tools I I still have Niche tools that are not even related to Wordpress um that I bought off of Flippa and sometimes just private Outreach because I knew those verticals were going to be lucrative because I had a better offer than they were promoting and I paid like one guy I think like fifteen thousand dollars up front and in the very first month it made me 18 Grand and now every month it makes me over 10 grand like and it's pure profit nobody touches that tool right so I think about ad just as good as a gas station because like my hosting cost for that tool is maybe like eight dollars a month right maybe 10. um and that's it so so you can have these cash flow income streams that come through and that's how I was able to buy the businesses that I did without any outside financing without any outside debt I was also in a market that wasn't fully mature so so like there was that advantage that you know those shrewd pe's and VCS are not in in the market they didn't understand the market um and I could see what the potential of a business so I might buy something and you're you're saying well this has no Revenue it just has user base and I can come in and say yeah but if I do this and this it can it can be a seven figure business so I might buy something for like you know six figures and then in two years that thing will make seven figures in profit you told me something once that sounded almost like a real estate um philosophy so like in real estate they always say or some people say you make money on the buy not on the sell meaning like you should buy something knowing that it has both a margin of safety and that you have the plan for what it's gonna how it's going to be different than what the current owner values it at and I think you've had a similar thing I forgot what the example was but it was sort of like uh like let's say for example you're like great I buy this company and they're paying three and a half percent on their payment things but I have a contract with that same payment provider because I have more scale that's at two percent so now I know I have 1.5 off just off the gross from day one because I I have this contract uh and you kind of have these principle of like almost like you make the money on the buy because you already know well I have I know I can throw this much traffic at it maybe from wpbeginner I know I can renegotiate these payment terms because I already have the contract with the paper provider or the affiliate contracts with the companies on the other side is that uh is that accurate 100 100 so this was one of the lessons I learned from from a mentor right and who had the real estate background so the philosophy is very much derivative of real estate you make money in the buy you have to be otherwise if you're paying a high multiple thinking based on future I mean yeah that might work out but it has a bigger risk so from my perspective you know I want to have heads I've been tails that don't lose much and I got that you know formula from reading monish babri's book I was a huge fan of his now her friends um but oh yeah so that's very much finding margin of safety explain that more heads I win Tails I don't lose much um what what does that mean and what's an example so a good example would be if if a business in your perspective intrinsic value of it is a million dollars and you end up paying 700 000 today heads you know you're gonna win if this business continues growing tells you know you you'll still have so much of upside that you know because you you paid 300 grand less 30 less than market value um that in case something don't doesn't go right it has to be like 40 doesn't go right and you still only lose 100 Grand in that situation so you need to be able to look at the deal and say what are my downsides you have to invert the situation um think about like how you're gonna die in this and then don't go there sort of thing our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better you sort of have this like pay attention to the sense and the dollars will follow type of vibe where like you're really not you're not I guess I'm surprised at how maybe I don't know if it's still the same way I'm surprised at how small some of the things that you do and yet because you own 30 or 40 of them they're really accumulating exactly so dude when you come from nothing you have you have to have a good sense of where the money is going to go right and you have to be very conservative to not lose it all because I came from nothing I don't want to go back to that so I'm very very cautious the funny thing about compounding is that if you compound at a healthy rate and I I have a very very good compounding track record what what is it I've been compounding it in double digits in for for past 70 years what's that mean 20 like what would be considered good like you know like free for you you're like all right 30 or 40 that's like I mean that's amazing you can't get that in any normal investment right exactly so Market compounded well eight percent yeah um private Equity might give might get you in teens right you know I I'm way way I'm double private Equity more than double so so that's and that only happens when you can identify a mismanaged gem okay um when some somebody has a has a business and they might only be thinking about monetizing monetizing from one angle they're not thinking about it from a full perspective so I can look at it and say well yes this is the current Revenue today and I'm getting a bargain on today's Revenue but here are my contracts that I have but so many different partners and vendors and such that I'll be able to unlock Extra Revenue here here here here here here so I turned this business that has one Revenue stream having like multiple revenue streams um and and that's how you take something that was doing like no Revenue to or or very low Revenue to having you know five eight ten million dollars in Revenue um and you do it enough times and you just let it compound like these businesses are not rocket growth right so this is not a um business that's going to hit one business gonna hit a billion dollar in Revenue that's not what's gonna happen but these businesses are going to consistently come pound because more people are going to need websites the web presence just keeps growing you had a Tailwind which was WordPress was just going to keep getting more and more and more popular right that's a huge Tailwind that's like a generational Tailwind that's huge this is already it's going to grow faster than like an average growth rate because of that then you could do things smart operationally but I gotta ask you a question so our buddy Moyes has this phrase he goes the two sexiest words in the English language are distressed asset and you just said mismanaged gems as a as a catchphrase of something you look for I like that idea but also I'm kind of a lazy [ __ ] and when I hear distressed asset or mismanaged gem I think work oh I gotta go clean up I gotta manage this better um isn't that gonna take a bunch of work and a bunch of Mind share to turn things around versus it's kind of like the Buffett cigarette butt companies versus like just buying a beautiful business that's already working and letting it letting it grow for a long period of time um am I wrong I must be wrong about the the amount of effort that goes into fixing a mismanaged gem or a distressed asset what do you think about that so I think distress asset from a real estate perspective I would say slightly different than what a mismanaged gem is my real estate buys Sean that I did uh in in early days were distressed assets okay um but it was just the banks needed to get get this off their books right and I was a cash buyer um you know I'm not looking to finance anything I'm a cash buyer I had the right contacts so I was able to buy some of those gas station properties they were already leased out to uh to put at least out to like kushtard the Canadian multi-billion dollar company that owns Circle K all I had to do was just give cash to the bank and take take the you know deed over so those are distressed asset and I got lucky I mean I bought a gas station um money was all said and done I paid 90 grand for it and you're like holy crap how did you do that that was a distressed asset because you had to do environmental cleanup on that thing okay that was work so so those are distress assets when you're thinking about mismanaged gem this is a property where somebody maybe do the lack of effort or lack of experience have not fully understand the potential that is there what are the commonalities of not realizing potential or common mistakes so you know you might you might be a Creator and you have a lot of user base and you just haven't think about monetization from you know all the different potential monetizations that that can be had in that one business yeah we have a friend that was doing this they were just looking at business on Flippa or like you know websites you know products to buy companies to buy and they were like yeah I just want an owner who just cared a lot about product and thought 95 of their brain just had the word product stamped all over it and then you're like cool so what were you doing for marketing and they're like well it's word of mouth and they were so proud of the word of mouth it's like great as long as their answer isn't Facebook ads then I'm just going to start doing Facebook ads or even if their answer was Facebook ads like what's the budget like oh you know like eight grand a month it's like why eight grand that's like uh you don't want to spend too much and he's like I want to spend 80 grand on Facebook you know like and basically that was his entire like you think oh this person made 20 million dollars wow they must be a genius and it's like no I just found a business which was so common somebody makes a product and all they think about is product and they really care about product they don't spend much on marketing maybe none because they don't know it or a small amount because they're just kind of like they don't think what like they don't ask themselves the question why don't I spend 10 times more on Facebook ads what would that take and that's literally the only change that they did that's the good barometer the other thing that that worked in our favor was the ecosystem effect so if I buy an analytics software I can cross-sell out than monster and vice versa you know if I if I buy member press then I know that all the people who are creating a course will need to buy optinmonster to have lead generation or it will need analytics to track all the things so the Synergy effect uh compounds and and that that was a big uh big up for us and I read somewhere that you said something like I don't buy whole steaks anymore I don't buy 100 of the company anymore I try to buy 49 because I can't I have too many things I can't run all of them and then in the pre-call they did with Sean you have this really cool line it's in quotes it says how I manage a billion dollar portfolio without stressing out when I met him he was like he said something like you were like I travel I was like what are the you know what do you do with your time like how are you spending your time and you were like oh I love to travel my family we go travel and I was like I thought you meant like you know like I don't know LA or you know like we go to see the Grand Canyon and you were like we're going to Egypt and then we're going to like the Serengeti and everyone like I was like oh okay this guy's like doing like Exotic Travel every month that's cool he you said something like I don't know this is exactly right but my brain heard you basically stack a bunch of calls with your kind of operators in the last week of the month and like that's your only time to like stress out or think about like those calls and then the rest of the month you're not thinking about those things you're reading you're playing basketball you're doing other things and um so a is that accurate and B like I interpreted that as wow this guy's managing a billion dollar portfolio and he's not stressed out that's awesome yes that is that is fairly accurate now it now it didn't start that way I wanna I wanna emphasize that it didn't start that way um I didn't figure this out up until maybe two years ago okay so just just to put in perspective uh in in terms of like me being as chill what was like what were you doing before that you know I would have to go in sometimes clean the business and you know like oh this this is not doing right I would get get involved too much were you a hard ass yeah depending on who you ask yeah sure according to me no according to everyone I ever worked with hell yeah like you you seem like you have a ruthless side to you even though you're polite and kind you seem like you could be ruthless I I was sad I could be very disciplined uh ruthless might not be the right word that sounds so ruthless the way you said that that was awesome yeah that's a ruthless thing to say the [ __ ] ruthless thing to say I love it so so the trick is you know like if people say higher good people get out of the way but that sounds easier than it is so we use EOS in our companies and some of your audience might be familiar with it others might not be is entrepreneurial operating system um and as transparency accountability oftentimes when you know I found I sometimes bought businesses from the founders who who started delegating but they really abdicated and then the business went down and then you know that now they're like they're really checked out so now they're like ah this this thing sucks now I'm back in the business and it's a mess and they will come and exit to us that's a mismanaged gem by the way because all what you got to do is put back those accountability things and maybe put a right team member and this will this will start uh kickstarting again so you have to delegate but not abdicate so the EOS scorecards and good P L's uh monitoring will help you with that accountability piece so the P L's for all of our companies um are managed by my finance team at the HQ level that's cool so you um I want to talk a little bit about ideas so uh you've built this amazing thing uh and you've been basically kind of like building Cool Stuff making money since 12 to 32. so you've had this run um I'm curious you know one of the questions we always get is all right well you know now it's easy for you it's easy for you to just keep doing what you're doing but like I'm not you so that's you know it's inspiring but it's not entirely helpful uh what would be more helpful is like what ideas or opportunities do you see that like somebody else could do you're too busy to do them or they're too too small for you now um what ideas or opportunities do you see that other people can do I think about cash flow so if I had nothing you know of course it's a lot easier for me now I can say hey Andrew I want to spend I want to invest in tiny I want to go do this and I can do a lot of those with the means that I have now but if I was starting all over the first thing would be to go build cash flow again and the easiest way to build cash flow is Services um you know agency business right now uh content agency since I know content well using AI I would crush it you know because I already know that Brands like Shopify Etc are using AI agencies to create top of the funnel content so of course there's some human adoming involved but this changes the game because if an article used to take maybe four hours to write now you can do it in 45 minutes right because if if you know the game right so a hustler younger version of me that's what I'd be doing content agencies copywriting agencies all AI Power Plus human review I would I would use like tools like clay.com I'm not sure if you've seen clay.com but it it helps you automate your sales Outreach you dump a profile and it finds all the data on on that person so you can write you can use GPT to write emails to them and then just hit them up right just call Outreach cold Outreach call Outreach because so not everybody but a small portion will you know take take you up on it deliver a great service go above and beyond with them watch the word of mouth take you places you raise prices um and I think that's uh that would be the way to go for me if I if I wanted to start all over again step one build cash flow then figure out how I can take this cash flow to build some recurring Revenue stream because in agency you're you still only have reoccurring Revenue stream and so uh then you would uh would you buy versus build from there and talk about that distinction because you started off as a builder you've now bought like I don't know 30 companies or something like that along the way and I think you studied not just Charlie Munger and Warren Buffett but also um Mark Leonard at constellation and you had told me something like you read all his annual letters and there was one thing in there that really stood out to you about building for spying what was that yeah it was one of his earlier letters maybe maybe like a third one or fourth one or something something like that um where Mark talked about that there was three types of growth that constellation was experiencing one was growed through organic which is just your business growing organically in their case maybe seven eight percent whatever um the second part of Revenue growth was coming from Acquisitions um where they would just go buy revenue and the third one was initiatives and initiatives would be things like new bills I had this product and I'm going to build a second product and he was like these turn out to be very expensive because it required more resources than time that you plan for it takes away time of your senior people um and you're not even counting those things so they're distracted and he's like you know I'm a capital allocator and from a pure Capital allocation perspective the return on invested Capital isn't always great because bills have higher risk so if it doesn't work out it's crap um for the first year or so when you're building there's zero percent return on your investment in that time so the compounding return is lower um and this this was my take was you know you can have ad spend of three years CAC at that point might not just go buy a company that has guaranteed revenue and then you can cross promote so so that sort of took me away from the initiatives idea so most over focus and all of our focus is on um is on buying one thing that I I imagine Sean is a little bit like this but I'm definitely like this where creating products and uh new businesses is is part self-expression where like it's just exciting it's fun to do that [ __ ] and I'm not like the most disciplined person when like the reason I don't like real estate is I'm like dude I I'm not very great at just looking at this Excel sheet and unlocking value like that's not that's not what I'm skilled at and I don't know if I even particularly like that where did you learn how to like unlock like find Value that you could unlock and what are some of the like common themes that you see uh with that I don't know Sean are you like that too yeah I am uh but then I'm also a a natural shortcutter I like to find the simplest path to the solution and that so like while creating like you had this thing you said on the Pod that was hilarious you're like I'm an artist bro I'm just an artist I gotta create and I definitely feel that I have a creative itch to me but I also have a path of least resistance itch to me where I'm like oh there's some beauty in just finding a simpler a simpler way to win um you know like I agree with that I also think it's fearful or it's it's fear to out like to pay like with the internet you could start with nothing and spend time and you can get something yeah but I think that's or you could he's like you could build something new High chance is just not gonna work it's a zero it's also gonna take a long time if you're buying something that's already working yes you out like cash but are you actually taking more risk there's a difference between putting out cash and putting out risk and I think what he's saying is that but that's what I'm asking is the difference I'm asking the difference between putting out cat like how do you make that Gap small so I'll I'll say this so when I started Sam I was very much an artist like you I enjoyed my creation I enjoyed putting my you know fingerprint footprint whatever you want to call it on those so when if you were looking at the early days of atten monster or those products you would have my footprint on them and then you had like a twenty thousand dollar bill to the Serengeti with your family of five I was not doing Serengeti when I was building the business you know I'm not doing anything I was building the business I was very very much involved but a big mindset shift that happened in my career which has led to I would say tremendous growth for awesome mode is the mindset of going from a Creator and operator to a capital allocator right and this happened when I was studying uh Buffett Monger uh Monash Etc Buffett says I'm a better investor because I'm a businessman and I'm a better businessman because I'm an investor now you you read that and you're like okay sounds good shoot right but when you think about that from a first principal's point of view what's the commonality between the twos that both investors and the businessmen are resource allocators or Capital allocators so when you can when you tie that together that was the aha moment for me when I think about okay if I start this new thing yes I'll make X but if I buy something if I shortcut it and let's say I buy something that's doing two million dollars in Revenue I you know 20 or 30 of 2 million is always going to be better than you know 10 or 30 of 100 000 or 100 100 000 for that matter you see what I'm saying what's the biggest what's the biggest deal that you've bought you don't have to say which one but like uh what checks out what check made you sweat well check made me sweat none of them because I'm not buying like I'm not putting 80 of my net worth or my cash in any any one of those deals but if you bought things for tens of millions no no and have not bought anything in the tens of million dollar range but these are so single digit millions that is [ __ ] insane that you've built that much value with like these little small like what's that whatever Sean said the cigarette butts like you've made the cigar with it but um and are you doing all cash up front or I there's no way you do that you're you're you're you're way too sophisticated mostly mostly all cash up front you do do that there might be some pieces of like seller financing but one one of the advantages that that we have uh compared to somebody offering like a higher valuation is that we can make the price process really seamless for for the seller that also allows us to have get a better and more attractive valuation um but you know if you try to ever sell to like a private Equity or a VC mostly private Equity you you'll be on in on the hook for like six months they'll be dragging you asking you for all sorts of nonsensical stuff and by the time the entrepreneurs is burnt out and it's just a shitty feeling um with us you know you send you send me a message over the website my assistant Source through it I'll look at it and say okay yeah this is good um we'll like look at it and ask you for the P L's within like a week or week or so time will give you an Loi and then we can close in 30 40 days after that holy [ __ ] are you the only decision maker yes that's insane I I like to think that I'm the chief risk officer of the company and you told me a story about risk you because I was like okay you buy all this stuff um like how much debt do you have you're like no debt and you're buying you know with a margin of safety and you're like even with his mortgages he says no mortgages no mortgages and and look look there's gonna be a lot of financially Savvy listeners here and I have many many financially Savvy friends who are billionaires uh and they disagree with me on this you know but but the way I was raised in in Pakistani culture that is considered bad it's considered taboo and short leverage can help you grow faster especially when used in a smart way but it also takes away the margin of safety which in troubled times can really destroy your autonomy if you're not being careful so you know I'm okay with getting rich slowly um and I think I've done all right for where I am I see myself with a turtle in a rabbit race bro you're a 32 year old like pretty much billionaire dude yeah yeah you're slow I'll be okay um it helped me sleep better at night be more bullish I don't know Sean is Sam do you know about uh Charlie and Warren's third business partner no no tell the story you see nobody knows about the third business partner um so they did have a third business partner uh his name was uh Rick right Rick Warren or something like this and he was just as smart as them but was in a hurry to get rich and monish asked Warren about what happened to Rick at one of the lunches that he had and this is public I'm not sharing with you anything Lauren's like Rick's a [ __ ] no no no Warren said something along the line with like Charlie and I always knew that we would become like you know incredibly wealthy but we were just not in a hurry to get wealthy we knew it would just happen Rick was just as smart as us but he was in a hurry so like in the 70s like 7374 downturn what ended up happening was that Rick had margin loans he was highly levered and the stock market went down 70 so all those margin calls happened and he had to sell his personal your shares to Warren and Warren bought him for like 40 bucks a piece right so now the same share is like half a half a million plus I'm gonna get a frame picture of this guy Rick on my wall and it's just gonna be a reminder every day don't be in a hurry to get rich it'll happen don't don't be in a hurry I that's going on my wall uh Sean I cut you off what were you gonna ask him um oh I wanted him to tell that story but also I wanted to go back to idea so you had given us the first move uh if I needed a cash flow right away I would do Service Agency maybe something around creating content for Brands using and use AI for leverage or generating leads for Brands and create a lead agency using AI for leverage um okay that's the get started plan but you don't want to be in the service business forever and you want to you want to get that's just to get you know the escape from broke jail print plan okay now you've done that what are what's kind of like level two type of ideas or opportunities you see I I would look into the Quick Cash Cow of tools right now there are these AI rappers right so you think like upload your PDF and we'll turn this into a chat GPD there's several of those out there right now but you can make it vertical focused that's what I would do I'd like chat GPD for lawyers add all of your internal Sops and now your team can just talk to it um real estate internal processes you can do this my team built this internally in about a week so it's not very hard to build you can pay somebody somebody on upwork to do it and then work with the different uh AI influencers on Tick Tock IG Etc and this can easily get you to 10K plus a month I know as a matter of fact like several kids that are making 10K over 10K a month and some even over 100k a month uh doing Justice Just the AI wrappers so I think that's uh that's that's pretty easy um I would I would look at how I can um Leverage The Freedom of Information Act to my advantage um what is trying to go into the student businesses are you familiar with foia no what is that okay so basically in the United States this works only if you're in the United States we have such thing called a Freedom of Information Act that allows you to request any kind of data from any government run Authority so usually journalists use it so we used to use it at the hustle all the time so like when big stories break oftentimes it's because the journalists did that and they like uncovered some you know controversial fact so now you can you can get creative with it right so you can you can go and say um to a government agency maybe a university or whatever uh Hey I want to see the contracts of your last three or five construction projects that you undertook um and that that will give you an advantage um in terms of how to approach terms and pricing that was approved before so when you're submitting your bid it's it's better so but you can get a really creative uh like that I remember I was talking this was a while ago um I was talking to a guy he was in Atlanta area and he would request student information from University so public universities um and he was targeting like nursing school graduates and so on if you were coming out of nursing school you know he he wanted your information and schools have to give it to you and you might pay them like a processing fee like 100 or something like that but you get the whole graduating classes name email address that you know their physical address that the University have them filed they give they give that to you um and then he would send those students an affiliate offer for student loan forgiveness program that was passed passenger the Obama Administration right and so the affiliate offer was for a company that would fill out those forms for you right and they would charge to charge you like I don't know 500 600 bucks and they would pay this guy and he was like I just sent one email I make six figures and I move on so I would find Arbitrage opportunities like these to build up more cash flow um and then I would go invest so but you know Sam when you when you're talking about in the earlier days you're very focused on the wp beginner but there was a lot of creative things that were happening like this that was helping my cash flow um grow uh and that allowed me to invest in software or some fun creative cash flow things you were doing at the time I'm not gonna die about this there's got to be one prolific one that that is I've heard a bunch through friends of friends I'm not going to mention any of them but I've heard I've heard some of your things I mean like the space that you're in everyone starts sometimes black hat a gray hat and then as you like start making real money you're like all right I gotta go legit uh but I've heard some crazy stories about what you used to do that's good yeah Justin Mary's had a good phrase he goes uh do whatever you got to do to make your nut and then go on your Noble Mission and um and I was like I don't know if I agree with that but I like the way you said it um let me put it that way and I know several people who have done that where it's like okay what were you doing before this oh I was running um you know this dating dating site affiliate you know affiliate ad Network it's like okay cool Plenty of Fish like you know this is not really where you want to hang out for too long or like these poker uh you know poker arbitrages poker Affiliates uh there was one guy selling ringtones with subscriptions there's a guy who emailed me that was like uh I think he said you could say this on the Pod he's like yeah like uh I go on Sportsbook every sports book has a welcome offer so he's like I go on Sportsbook a and they have a welcome offer of like they'll match up to 20 of your deposit up to whatever a thousand dollars on it and B has the same welcome offer and I go max out both welcome offers and I bet on the same game for team a team B I lose the small rake but I take the whole welcome offer and I just let's do that again and again and again it's so simple and so funny that you do this what are you have you ever had liquidity from selling a business or is the majority of your liquid wealth come through annual cash flows and are you pulling out a significant Chunk from the from the business yes um I'm pulling up massive chunks from the business um in terms of liquidity event yes I sold uh two two businesses relatively small you know seven figure exits on both of those one was the YouTube channel business and another was a was a software photography software business um in terms of the cash flow you know we operate with a very healthy cash flow so I moved that out to the to the whole level um and then use that cash to invest um you know in a private businesses as well is in real estate and public markets if you had a pie a good question Sean always asks is what do you do with your money if you had a pie of your uh net worth what's that allocation looking like pie chart not just a pie a pie chart or a pie yeah or a pie it's still heavily skewed towards my business the online business portfolio extremely extremely heavily skewed um I would say then a good chunk is in the in the public stock market um and then I have cash do you actively manage your portfolio or are you uh are you just doing boring [ __ ] big chunk of it is boring and you know dollar cost average index um I have begun to play with you know a little bit of money to uh to see what I can do with it I've done all right like stocks or other stuff no no stock stocks this is only I was only talking about public Investments because real estate is separate you um you talked about like kind of coming from nothing literally sleeping on the floor uh because you're like why would I buy furniture I should not buy furniture even when you had money um yeah but I believe two things a money is a tool it's not the like end goal it's a tool to enable you to do something with it and B um there's no point to money except for to you know uh you know enhance your lifestyle other people's lifestyle you know and improve lives in some way right it would be a shame to just uh have the money and never use it have you and and spending money and spending money is as much of a skill as making money you just you know you just start it later in life um have you learned how to spend money and uh what have you learned what can you teach us yeah uh yes in the early days I saved everything I mean I did not buy a bed until I got married dude just to put in perspective even when we were dating no there's no bed [Music] ladies find you a man finds you a man with no pain so so you know I I met my wife in high school um so she's known me since I was broke and you know her her parents weren't that well off either so um so yeah in terms of learning how to spend the money yes now I have right for me and the culture and how I was raised we take care of family first um and my first thing was to ensure my parents are retired because my dad worked really really hard when I you know when we moved to us so my my parents are retired I mean they go to Pakistan maybe like four times a year they're in Pakistan you know like right now for example so um so yeah so that that was first thing first in terms of making that impact um in terms of traveling I I realized that I get a lot of creativity and joy out of just going and seeing new places um and I spend the money on those those things are you giving Equity to your uh people like is the structure where is there like a hold code that you fully own and then the whole Co owns 80 of this company 70 of this company yes in the early days that's what I did now I don't do that now you don't give Equity to the operator no do you regret giving Equity no I I enjoy working with those co-founders and I I don't think I would be able to do what I did without them what now you're only 32 like what are you gonna like how do you get up in the morning and feel motivated you know what do you what's what's driving you now I want to build a generational company sounds like you're there though no I think it's generational one like you know when my kid kids are older and grandkids are around I I'm I'm probably going to be doing this till till I'm dead um I enjoy the game I enjoy the fun of it um I know Sam doesn't get excited about uh about buying a business and fixing it up and growing it I I get I get a thrill out of it you know because for me that's the opportunity that's the hustle like finding finding the edge um getting that deal uh you you can say in in some sense um just just getting an unfair Advantage um but but knowing those tricks knowing those tactics giving me a head like you know like if you play basketball I mean we all play basketball and I sucked at it right but there were some people like Alex was amazing right because Alex had been doing this for a long time and he has tactics he could just cross you over or whatnot um I like having those tactics in in the business okay what's crazy is you might be like probably in the top 50 richest maybe maybe top 100 top 200 richest under 40 year olds in America I've kept a very very low profile and the only way this would be validated is if I ever was ever to race around or if I was to exit right um so right now what I can see in looking at are our numbers and what similar companies trade at and and you know exit at my assumptions are based on that um but it actually doesn't matter to me one way or another I'm pretty uncomfortable this model of buy don't build and um of becoming a hold Co and having a portfolio like there's a whole bunch of people who I know that are trying to do this right now I'm sure you get a bunch of questions I think I've called you asking you a bunch of questions about this um what do you think uh they get wrong what's the common mistake or trap you think smart people can fall into trying to do this path or what's a misconception that smart people have when they come into this one thing that I've I've noticed uh there's several things but this is the primary thing is that the excitement takes them away so they they'll overpay on a deal and then regret it later on when they find out because oftentimes they're taking investors money um they are on a timeline you know most of them are trying to raise a fund you know your typical 10-year plus two years whatever so they have they're not disciplined enough uh to wait and I have no rush like you know if I don't buy a company this year no doesn't make a difference um but you know so it allows me to be more measured and disciplined in the deals that we do um and that's that's probably the biggest thing yeah and and or underestimating the problems that exist in a business the first interview that I saw with you was it looks like it was on mixergy our friend Andrew Warner it looks like it might have been 2014 but I think it was even before that and Andrew was like how much revenue do do you do and go you go Andrew I told you I'm not going to tell you this and uh it was pretty funny and then I asked you to come on here and you're like I'm not telling you these numbers you've told us a lot of [ __ ] like it seems like you're you're you're in a different uh sphere than you were before where you don't mind talking about some cool stuff and I think that that's neat because you're like maturing from like this hacker probably gray hat hacker from you know 20 years ago 15 years ago to like kind of a tycoon I think you know when when I was younger I was afraid um you know just from a taboo things but also I didn't I want to fly under the radar and I still do but I wasn't very vulnerable um I struggled with vulnerability and that that change as my network changed as as I continued leveling up um you know with with I mean now my form is amazing and with my PO but it's not an IPO form but everybody's in ypf um and those kind of you know groups really really help you mature and find your blind spots and things like that so so I'm you know definitely appreciative of the friends that I have who call me out on those things and they have helped me become better I'm gonna have to use that little clip for my new company as an ad thanks we use AI to replace what the company you said uh no man I think by the way if your goal is to have a low profile I have a feeling that's going to change when the headline of this of this podcast comes out because uh I don't think honestly that he's trying to keep a low profile I just feel like you care about being humble and and you came across a lot of humility uh you know not false humility you know false humility is basically like uh I'm gonna downplay everything and not tell you anything and um that's actually like a different form of sort of uh you know I don't know arrogance or narcissism the non-flex flex yeah the not Flex Flex right or the it's sort of this close the door uh behind me on the way in so you know I'm in but you can't get in because I'm not gonna really do anything like you know I think the best people are the ones who sort of become the person they needed when they were younger and I think that like you know the younger version of you if you heard something like this all right this guy came from nothing moved here for Pakistan didn't speak English was like sitting in the library because he didn't know how to make friends in the school was like all right I want to play video games the library had a firewall so his first business was creating a proxy to get around the firewall and they started giving that to other the kids as a both a way to like make friends and make a little bit of money and then he took money and like he was like okay how do we get more customers and it's not like he's some business Savant he just kept asking how do we get more customers oh what if a directory posted about me how do I get them to do that what's in it for them and like you do you just one foot after another so I think you uh yeah I think you did a good job of basically like without um putting yourself in a position where you said something you're uncomfortable with you know you you did share stuff that I think is you know for me at least pretty uh pretty inspiring you're somebody that uh you know I gave Ben a list of like five people I was like you know who are the five people that we've met because we met a lot of people last two years I said in the last two years who are the people that we've met that were kind of the most inspiring they seem to have a blueprint for life not just business that was working for them yeah their business part of their life was working but they were also like content and they weren't you know like in the first five minutes of meeting them like weirdly bragging about stuff or like saying something that revealed some like weird insecurity that's driving them still and they haven't gotten over it's like I don't know those people are their characters they're fun to be around but like I'm not trying to be them um you know like somebody who's you know has a family life that they actually care about so we put you on that list um and I'm glad you came on because for sure I don't think most people even know your story and that's a shame you know like uh I think more people are gonna know your story now after this where should people like follow you or where do you want to send them to uh well really quick Sean before we wrap up I want to tell you something so he has this website so Google syed's uh so it uh I want the listener to Google this so s-y-e-d and then his last name b-a-l-k-h-i and then Google that and then the word net worth he's got this hilarious blog post oh this is yours Sam told me about this yeah yes where it says what did what's science net worth the first line you're probably thinking and so his his website comes up first and it's a blog post you're probably thinking that I'm some sort of narcissist writing about my own net worth in third person it's quite the contrary I was looking through search traffic for my blog and I noticed that I have a lot of type in traffic for users simply searching my name uh and then the term net worth and then he goes on to explain that it's like it's always changing but it's not but knowing someone's net worth is not going to help you succeed but he's got those hilarious posts and it was really funny and uh that you also I want to give a shout out we talked a lot about money and [ __ ] you've got uh amazing posts where you do an annual wrap up I've been reading that for years I think you started in 2017. 15 2015 2015. you put a big emphasis on philanthropy so like you have a school I I think you're big on schools right you build schools I forget where Pakistan I think and you like are giving away uh you put a lot of emphasis on uh philanthropy and then it's you and your wife and your kid and a lot of these stuff and you have your own Foundation you're giving away a lot of stuff and so um I think it's awesome I think that to reiterate what Sean said about being like a you know he has this joke about being a total man about and uh in a way that's kind of like what you are is like you're like a holistic person and your your personal website does a really good job of explaining that yeah you know I I started doing those write-ups when my son when we found out we're gonna be you know we're gonna have our son um I was like okay I should start recapping this um well we start trying to have a kid I'm like I should start recapping um what's happening in my life so that way uh because I'm gonna forget it and at some point you know I may want to tell them oh check this out check this out and that's how those year-end reviews came about and I enjoy writing them and a lot of people love reading them including you thank you Sam for reading it and in terms of Education I do believe that levels of playing field and that's why we're you know we do what we do well I was gonna say sam gave you a compliment I'm gonna make fun of you the home page needs a revamp you go entrepreneur investor and marketing extraordinaire with extraordinary and then there's a photo of you with the the headset the bottom the Ted the Ted the pagada bike you got the clicker and

so here's some quotes I'd like to read you okay on blowing 100 million dollars quote it happens when I know cats that blew double that that's the second response it continues it can happen to anyone I don't think you could have it anywhere [Music] all right what's up we got a fun episode here so we're gonna do we're gonna play a little game and the game is that Sam I want me and you to go back and forth kind of like we do when we hang out if we were just back in the day when we both used to drink it drink a beer or two and we would just try to entertain each other sort of one-up each other with stories and um I'll tell you a story a business story that I think is pretty juicy you tell me a business story that you think is pretty juicy and we're gonna see who we're gonna we're gonna measure these uh you know to see who can tell the juiciest backstory behind celebrity Brands now I texted you last night I go celebrity brands but not the celebrity part the juicy backstory and that's all we said to each other like for example uh we don't use this one but what's the uh Kylie Cosmetics uh Kendall what's her name Kylie Jenner Kylie Jenner she has this lipstick company that does hundreds of millions in Revenue she's obviously not the one like running the show she had to partner with someone number two a behind the scenes person we're gonna talk all about behind the scenes people who is that number two how did they make this come about how do they get the celebrity partnership what made it work versus many others that failed um who are these sharks that are that are behind the scenes who's the number two we're go so I dare say we're going number two today and we're doing it live with all of you all right we rake it from raised to Grape with the wine being a 10 out of 10 grippy nine out of ten I don't actually know what's the in between stages of Raisin and grape but is it juicy like a prune like a raisin like a grape or is it straight wine that's how juicy this is Juicy Juice uh boxes that's how that's how good these can be all right so dude I I have a I have a low juicy story I wanted to ask you or ask your opinion about before we get into this yeah go for it this listen this weekend I went to Miami for this Hampton thing we went like lobster diving it was awesome I stayed at a very fancy hotel I'm not gonna name the hotel yet because I want to see I wait to the end of the story I was working out you know those cable machines like it's like uh cable machines were used at Raw like use the rod to like change the weights at the bottom and you know how there's like a 2.5 pound weight that's usually at the top that's like adjustable yeah I I was fixing the weight and the Machine was broken apparently I didn't notice it was broken and that two-point Rod that 2.5 pound weight fell on my finger I have got my finger looks like a great can you see that is it all purple yeah I can see it all right the question is is what type of petty Court do we go to about this is this just like is this just like a free stay like do I get my money back is it like I want my money back plus like another free stay well you you have to find a way to talk where you're waving that like you got to change your gestures so like you got to have like this Obama Style Just gesticular you know motions when you're talking because you need to see the manager that the manager needs to see the finger and the finger I mean you're not you're not trying to wave it in their face it's just you just need to do one of those where you point at it you're like what what am I supposed to do about this I mean yeah I need something for this this doesn't happen this is off your property sure did yeah look if I go to a fancy hotel I expect a fancy gym right not like with the screws come out of the freaking equipment so I my finger looks like a grape right now right it's like you know it's one of those injuries that isn't you don't do anything with a broken finger right you do nothing but God damn it hurts this is like when Willis Reed limped into game seven of the NBA finals from the tunnel and the crowd goes crazy they said no it's not possible he couldn't possibly be playing with that injury that's how people playing this podcast today should feel about your ability to persevere through that Intrigue I'm a blogger bro I'm a I'm a tweeter I tweet and also I can't exercise now for a week and that's why I make a living is with my seven out of 10 body yeah that's how a cat feels when they lose one of their lives so anyway maybe I'll have an update to the story maybe I'll get a free stay to blank Hotel name but we'll see if I can persevere with this just aching finger but I think we I think we could do it do you want to go through your best okay so there's this woman named Emma greed do you know that name no I'm agree first of all destined to be famous with a name like that Emma greed agreed like greed like money greed yeah but it's g-r-e-d-e says a little bit like got her own got her own spin on it so um she is the business shark behind a bunch of the Kardashian Brands so she was a founding partner in skims the multi-billion dollar shapewear brand for Kim Kardashian her husband is the CEO of that by the way uh so the the couple is behind this the next one is um she co-founded good American the jeans brand that's massive that probably does 300 million a year in Revenue um so you know uh with Khloe Kardashian so she that's how she broke into that and then with Kris Jenner she goes to the mom and she co-founds safely a plant-based cleaning product brand um with her and Chrissy Teigen and so this woman she's so impressive um if you've ever seen her a lot of people now have seen her because I think she's on Shark Tank this season so if you like are into that form of like you know uh entertainment if you've seen her she's so she's super polished so she's she's this woman who's half black half white super good looking British accent and an absolute Savage in terms of business this is what I've gathered from watching a bunch of interviews of hers by the way did you see the recent Rays for skims I think skims raised 200 million dollars at a three billion evaluation yeah and she owns oh my God she owned eight percent of that I don't know after dilution what she owns but she owned eight percent of that so her stake in skims alone is basically a multi-hundred million dollar stake um forget about good American where she was like you know it was her idea she was the the kind of the the CEO she's the she's the operator behind that so here's you want to hear her story it's uh yeah it's pretty good so she's um she's daughter of a single mom which is the start of every great uh entrepreneurial Story by the way uh second thing she she basically is like a hustler which is Young she's got a paper route she's like working at a deli she's just working all kinds of like blue collar jobs and she's like okay you know what I want to make it in fashion and so she goes to the London College of fashion and she's 14 15 years old she's already like interning at Gucci she's like hustling her way into like these like low-level internships at fashion brands and she drops out because she's like dude I'm hustling on the weekends and after school like these fashion shows or in my internship I'm networking with all these people I feel like I'm learning way more and building a way more valuable asset which is my network outside of school than I am inside of school so she drops out and she starts working for a couple of like she works for like a a Runway company and then she starts her own agency she's like oh okay here's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna create this agency called ITB uh she's 26 years old I think at the time and she's like she's been hustling in the fashion industry so now she's got connections so she's like hey let me just be a DOT connector and so she's like I'm going to connect all these fashion brands want to do collabs with influencers and celebrities and I'll create an agency that does that for them so oh you know the way she kind of got her break was Calvin mccleine wants to do a campaign for their new launch of whatever the new thing is she sources 70 different models and influencers for them signs all the contracts one of those people is Kendall Jenner to do that deal she meets Kris Jenner and so she becomes somewhat friendly like they've done a couple of campaigns together she's booked her out she has a little bit of respect so here's what she does then she's like okay this model of connecting like using kind of celebrity influencers is working for these brands but they kind of do it in a inauthentic way it's like only transactions like when when you need the when you need them to promote X product they show up and then they disappear she's like no no I think we should have a story and a celebrity at the beginning of these Brands and so she has this idea for good American a denim brand that is I I don't know if you're how familiar you are with it but it's basically like their thing is it's kind of like all sizes it's sort of like body positive early on and she was like you know we're gonna have we're gonna carry like from size zero to size whatever like 24 or something like that imagine that pitch to one of the Kardashians so it worked like she's like I know but like look here's here's the thing Chloe she's like why me well Chloe you might want to sit down for a second you have to say one of those things like I'm not racist but it's like uh yeah I'm not trying to be offensive but you're the perfect fit for this brand I don't know which one is Chloe but they're all like obviously fit and skinny but she maybe she's like the she's the one who kind of went up and down and wait she was like At first she was like the big the bigger one of the sisters and she like had these like sisters who were like you know size zero that was insecurity and she got super super skinny but then she like kind of you know imagine that conversations with like Weight Watchers or like one of these Brands comes to you you know what I mean or like I'm honored you know how Jamie Lee Curtis is the spokesperson for that yogurt company that makes you poop regularly uh what's it called yeah I don't know which one it's it's like a yogurt that like elderly people are supposed to eat so it makes them go to the bathroom like on a regular basis like a message like look we're gonna call it oops I cracked my pants and we we want you to be the face a you know what I mean who cares I I don't care you know there's no problem with this the uh so she pitches Kris Jenner she goes Chris I bumped she bumped into her fashion she's like I got an idea for a brand and she was expecting like look I know you guys get hundreds of offers but she's like I've already seen how much of a hustler you are she's like I observed the way you operate like I already kind of like kind of uh co-sign this you should just meet with Chloe directly see if Chloe likes it if she likes it heard it already has my blessing so she meets with Chloe Chloe's in and they basically start this brand uh brand has scaled up now into the hundreds of millions it's one of the the fastest growing denim Brands the jeans brands from there she then approaches Kim and she's like Kim we should do a shapewear brand and her husband who's also in the fashion industry became the the kind of the day-to-day person because she was busy with good American but they together create skims which becomes a multi-billion dollar shapewear brand then she does this one with with her uh with with the mom as well and so I just found this fascinating what this family is doing so they basically have a hold code the Glee family what's that the Glebe family the greed family or so James greed and emigrid so they basically have a hold code called Popular Ventures or something a popular culture or something like that like he also did Brady the clothing brand with Tom Brady so they're spitting up these fashion and and consumer product brands with a plus celebrities and they've built they're on the Forbes list now these guys have a like you know 400 500 million dollar net worth just co-founding these with uh with the Kardashian family and with uh you know Tom Brady and whatnot so impressive to fold that off behind the scenes uh and what's frame they have another one called frame is that a fashion brand that the husband started that they sell like 300 t-shirts I I don't get it but like you know have you seen what they look like this husband and wife couple it's hard to like them because they're so good looking they're like perfect yeah like they're so good looking they're both they both look like it I was definitely reading it and I was like yeah but they probably don't have a good relationship I was like trying to find some crap cholesterol issues you never know nobody's got it all yeah yeah but this guy probably broke both fingers not even just one yeah they they're pretty perfect like these guys look like influencers themselves and so all right so where do you put where do you rank on the juicy scale Emma and Jen's Greed from prune to wine uh it's in the middle so they're incredibly impressive this is amazing that they do this it's what's even more amazing is that like so John Rockefeller had this famous uh phrase where he would uh when he was trying to buy other companies he was like look you should you should join my oil company I make so much money and they're like no you can't make more he goes look I know I make money I make money in ways that you can't even dream about you have no idea how much money I make and that's exactly what the Kardashians are like this good America that's just this little thing I've never even heard of that makes hundreds of millions of dollars that's amazing um but there's no drama here so I'm gonna put it like right in the middle a prune does a prune have juice in it I think it does we're gonna give it a prune prune's the lowest it's principle raisin is the middle I think we're going with then it's a razor this is a raisin there's there's no drama here I need some drama but this is these guys are amazing they're a perfect couple I understand I tried to start with like you know raised from a single mother because that was really the only like story of of not just badass winning um you know but uh The Humble origin story but I agree with you there was uh like if you Google her name there's like a picture of her and Khloe Kardashian posing with I guess one of their brands and they look like models like I was like is this the founder or or a model they look like models this reminds me of I actually didn't do uh research on this guy but it reminds me he is also in the Kardashian sphere but have you heard of Brian Lee The Honest Company guy yeah so Brian Lee so do you remember who that's so weird do you remember Robert Shapiro I don't know if you would remember him lawyer who is that the lawyer okay the lawyer so basically Robert Shapiro was one of the guys I think he defended O.J Simpson that's what he was famous for do you remember that's their dad right no so this is where it gets uh funny so Robert so the Kardashian family is famous because one of the Kardashians I forget the name the dad who's who's uh died he defended O.J Simpson along with Robert Shapiro and Robert Shapiro you know he's a lawyer Big Shot probably a smart guy he ends up partnering with Brian Lee Brian Lee's this this guy did in 2001 so Brian Lee was only in his uh early 20s he goes hey I have this idea for this legal company but I need a celebrity to be the face of it so somehow he call or he actually cold call Robert Shapiro and said hey do you want to be a partner on my new legal company and he's like yeah come to my office let's talk about it and he Woos them it works out well that company is now called LegalZoom and it's a I don't know if it's quite a billion dollar company but it's in that range it's a really successful company and so Robert Shapiro and Brian Lee were like hey this worked who the else do you want to do it with and Roberto's like well I got these friends you know I worked with their dad the Kardashians what if we worked with them and so he does it again and he creates this company called ShoeDazzle which doesn't end up working out amazingly and it was actually pretty early this was in 2009 with Kim Kardashian he partnered with her and it was like a subscription shoe company didn't work out that well and his third company he did called The Honest Company which I think they went public yeah do they go public yeah they are public and so he partnered with Jessica Alba for that and he ended up selling like I think 30 million dollars worth of shares before it even went public now he's doing it again where he co-founded another company with Derek Jeter and it's a digital sports card collecting company so this guy Brian Lee has been doing the same thing very similar to the greed family of like in the Kardashian sphere and just like being the operator and uh he's a pretty amazing guy so Brian Lee's an interesting guy as well dude we could pull up honest Company's stock by the way hammered absolutely absolutely what's it at now when it debuted in 2021 is that 20 share is currently at a dollar forty it is now only worth 130 million dollars market cap is it really I think they do like 100 million in sales so it's I guess it's trading for one times Revenue ouch it's kind of great brand I wonder uh who's gonna buy that I think I feel like that's a great Target to buy yeah it's an interesting one but this guy Brian Lee's been doing this stuff we'll put him in the same category though that's only a middle one when you're with the Kardashians it's kind of a stack deck yeah it's a stack deck um all right you you do one all right I have one so this one's kind of uh popular right now but there's a really interesting story behind it so virtual dining company or is that what it's called sorry virtual virtual dining Concepts so basically a couple years ago Mr Beast launched Beast burger and the idea that I think they actually do they tell us on the Pod I think he mentioned this in the Pod right his manager uh yeah I think so he was basically like we had this idea and we went from like idea to executing in like such a short amount of time which was a huge mistake I think he said they did it in like 60 days or 90 days something crazy but they partnered with this company called virtual dining Concepts and they launch this thing two years later now it's like a show so Mr Beast is tweeting uh and he's actually deleted a bunch of the tweets but he's basically said like this company has ruined my reputation because the burger sucks the quality control sucks now they are both suing each other so that alone is a story but that's not even the interesting part the interesting part is the guy behind it so the guy behind it his name is Robert Earl so Robert Earl is interesting because in his early 20s he started a company that was just it was just a restaurant I think it was like a medieval restaurant have you ever like seen those on on like movies no but every time I would go to Vegas I would stay at what's that castle one called the medieval castle it's like uh that terrible hotel that's where I almost stayed well he started this thing I think it was called beef eater and it was in England he's from England and it was called beef eater and it was like a medieval themed restaurant and so he starts growing that and after a handful of years like 10 years he sells it makes like 60 million dollars and he's like all right what what what next and so his next thing is Planet Hollywood do you remember Planet Hollywood of course so Planet Hollywood was a restaurant concept where it was like we're gonna go big with all the stars so it was big stars were Bruce Willis um Sylvester Stallone Arnold Schwarzenegger and then like Demi Moore Cindy Crawford he had like all the stars like aligned with this restaurant and he gave them all equity and goes you guys are going to be a face we're gonna do Planet Hollywood you go to the restaurant and there's going to be like Wax figures of all the celebrities whatever it was a big deal at the time and he expands it and eventually goes public but they expand way too quickly and they eventually go bankrupt but it's still like it's kind of like a famous failure in that it actually probably could have worked but they expanded too quickly then he keeps doing this though so he eventually buys yeah stop he's a concept junkie this guy he's a concept this guy he's a concept brainstorming with this guy like this guy would this guy would would not stop I feel like yeah I gotta be I need to get in a room with Robert Earl and I need to have a brainstorm well he's really interesting and so now he's got this thing I think it's called um uh look up uh Earl Enterprises so he's got this thing now where he owns um they own like 30 different restaurants now and it does something like 500 600 million dollars a year in revenue and some of the brands are a chicken restaurant with Guy Fieri he owns uh do you remember uh you know uh Balducci like Italian sandwiches and like pasta restaurants yeah for too cheap it's like better than Applebee's a little bit you know they're like they're really better than Applebee's is the bar we've got to maintain vigorously for all of our guns yeah that's like the thing like none of them are like crazy fancy but they're all like you know it's like 25 a meal type of thing but he owns a ton of them and so he's in all not all of them but many of them have a celebrity behind them and so he gets this idea when ghost kitchens start popping up with Uber and doordash starts popping up and so he gets his son to help co-found this new company with them and that's what virtual dining is and so he has one with um bar stool where it's like pardon part of my cheesesteak part of my Cheesesteak it's a Cheesesteak uh business and then he decides to do the same thing except this time he does it with Mr Beast burger or Mr uh it's called Mr Beast burger or beast burger and it takes off but then obviously they have the their their issues but he has still done it with a ton of people so he's done it with Mariah Carey so he has Mariah's cookies he started with rapper Tyga which is crazy to me that Tyga is even relevant but I think by the way how does he have that much pull well Tyga dated one of the Kardashian girls so maybe that's how I don't know you can walk into my house right now and I would say Hey sir what's your name I would not know yeah who Tyga is um yeah it's weird so he has Tiger bites they have part of my cheesecake I need to meet somebody who's just eating Tiger bites like who are the who are the customers think of my thing yeah yeah yeah they are strong and you know I think I think he's working on Hoobastank Hoagies uh that's gonna be the next one yeah I don't know what the deal is with Tyga but he's done this a whole bunch of times where he has this like pretty massive Empire and right now he's being sued and uh he's they said in the comment or they made a comment and they're like look like a lot of people are complaining about Beast Burgers but he goes That's just normal like when you serve all these people uh and he's like look look at all of our restaurants people complain look it's normal people complain about all our but but the guy's got like a ton of stuff going on so he owns a casino he owns a Aladdin Resort and Casino and lost on the Las Vegas Strip he still owns Planet Hollywood and they're trying to make it uh come back a little bit or he owns a couple of them he owns a soccer team that Everton soccer team have you heard of that yeah of course uh yeah and him and his wife live in a 25 000 square foot mansion in Florida I mean the guy's a baller and if you if you Google him he's like this old looking guy who kind of wears tacky shirts but he looks like a like a blast to hang out with he has a TV show now where he's like it's almost like uh what's that TV show called like uh everyone feeds Phil where it's just like a dorky guy just like talking to restaurant owners and like learning about the local Cuisine he's got one of those things so he seems like that's his show then that's not a show it's like it's very it's very similar to that but this guy um dude these people who have these like sprawling Empires where they're like yeah I own uh you know Planet Hollywood but then I got this uh I have this like you know juice brand and then I have this hotel over here and then I got like I own the soccer team um is that who you want to be uh I'm curious because I think some people really want that I'm not sure that I would want that that seems like just a lot of knowledge um it seems like a lot yeah like it seems like is that a goal of yours or I definitely respect it from the farm but I don't think I want to be that that guy I think owning a sports team would be cool but I don't want to own like 500 restaurants so like he owns I don't know if you've even heard of any of these Asian street eats The Breakfast Club uh uh berducci's I've heard of that Brio Italian Grill Bravo Italian Kitchen Chicken guy that's Guy Fieri's two J's Cafe Hollywood have you heard of any of these no not really they're all like restaurants that have like 10 or 20 locations and like hopefully each location makes like five million dollars and it's like highly profitable another guy who does this in the same similar category is uh Tillman for Tita do you know who that is you probably know him because he owns uh Houston Rockets I think so he I read this interview with him and he goes I think I am one of the largest companies in America that is fully owned by one person so he owns 100 of the Fertitta Enterprises and it does something like 4 billion in Revenue 1 million 1 billion in ebitda he owns like all these kind of you know and some I guess nice stuff he owns like some steakhouses maybe like Ruth Chris I think he owns but then he owns like Bubba Gump Shrimp and stuff like that um but some of these restaurant Brands where it's like 30 50 a meal apparently they must be really profitable because I've read about a few of these guys including Robert Earl I've read about Tillman for Tita so I don't know I guess it works but it seems like a pain in the ass to deal with all these types of people yeah uh let's move on to the next one um let's what's that one oh yeah we gotta rank that one on the juicy scale I'm gonna give it uh I think that might also be a raisin um partly out of Revenge and partly because uh this guy owns a bunch of like mid-tier things and so I feel like I can't possibly rank him above I I don't want to eat at any of his products let's put it that way oh you know yeah I do think that but I you know wait did you go to but didn't you go to Chuck E Cheese's this weekend I did not wish I wish I had uh did not I thought you said you were taking your kids there you're thinking of someone else I went puppy golf uh at this dude it's hilarious these guys opened up a pup they just took a parking lot and then like a husband and wife just sort of had a plywood built a few holes and they just charge you ten dollars to walk in that area the of the parking lot and they'll give you a club and my kids love it and we go there like you know like twice a month it's kind of this insane like uh business plan that makes no sense I think that makes tons of sense I mean there's just no like it's putting without the green you're putting on concrete and trying to get it oh there's there's no there's not even Turf no Turf oh there's a little bit of turf but it's like the whole thing is very like and all things like made of concrete so you know it's not a great not a great look yikes all right what do you got all right um I'm gonna do one that actually we've we did I was trying to do research for this and the best breakdown of this business was our own podcast like two years ago but the fact that I had forgot it means that everybody forgot it I'm gonna I'm gonna talk about guthy ranker so these Legends these are the Geniuses behind a bunch of celebrity things uh let me pull up my notes here so um backstory for these guys including one of my favorite books which one if they can grow Rich well yes exactly so okay so here's the here's the the way that the the business works so Guthrie ranker so um one of the guys guthy his last name's guthy he's he has a business that's basically audio cassette tape um copies so you have a you have an audio tape you want to make 10 000 copies to sell your music or whatever he makes the 10 000. I think it was even called like audio tape duplication Enterprise or some like that and uh it's a okay business but then suddenly he gets a call from a guy by the way I love names like that which lets us start bringing that back I'm sick of the like cute that ends in l y you know like tapely yeah I mean I want Hampton audio yeah why isn't it a bunch of dudes talking about their feelings I tried to make Hampton a little bit like uh Jordan Belfort named his company stratman Oakmont Jordan Belford's the uh waffle washer guy they're like that's who you want to model yourself it was like why'd you do that he's like I don't know like I just thought of these two words and it sounded like an official thing and I was like I gotta like that uh but I do prefer I do like like audio tape Enterprises exactly [Music] software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better okay so he gets an order he gets an order for 120 000 tapes he's like 120 000 oh my God who who is this so he calls up the guy hey just want to make sure your order is correct 120 000 or what did you mean twelve thousand say no no 120 000 he said I've never heard of you before what do you do turns out the guy is a real estate guy in Arizona but what he started doing was he was like oh yeah I was a real estate guy but then I realized I could just teach people how to make money in real estate and it's going gangbusters and he's like what how does this guy doing it he's like I just ran a commercial for 30 minutes about that I could teach people to make money in real estate you can't do a 30 minute commercial and he's like yeah it turns out that there was as you like to say and inflection and the inflection was that in 1984 the FCC deregulated the ad limit so they said you know before that there was some rules you only have like 12 or 16 minutes of ads per hour of TV they removed the limit and so now what people could do was they could just go to a channel and be like hey can I just buy like your 11 pm slot for like five grand and they're like sure and they would just bought they was by the hour of Television programming and they would just run a giant commercial an infomercial and so Jonathan hears this and he goes to uh he goes to meet up with his buddy this guy ranker and he's like yo uh ranker is working at his family's Hotel Resort at the time and he's like you know he's kind of like the pool and tennis guy he's just like sitting around doing nothing and he's like this guy ordered 120 000 tapes this is amazing I think this might be a better business than the tape business like you know then you know rather than copy the tapes why don't I copy his business and he's like he's like all right so what do we do he's like this infomercial thing I think we could do this he's like well all right so they go they buy every book they can read on commercials or like but there wasn't really even the word at the time because again the rule just got a chance there wasn't even a category called infomercials at the time they started studying copywriting direct response marketing and after a few days of just like cramming rankers like I think we could do this like what should we start with they're like well we could try the real estate thing but neither of us know anything about real estate nor do we like have a passion for that let's at least for this first one start with something we both the what's the common ground that we both think is like awesome like the thing we became friends on was this kind of self self-help self-development personal development category so this is like that uh sign that Cartman has when he's like coming up with a startup idea he's like look step one we're gonna start up step two we're gonna scale up the step three we're gonna bro down or like when they're talking about stealing the underwear they're like steel underwear and then probably yeah they're like well what what comes in the middle exactly and it worked uh it actually that actually is uh that actually is how most startups work by the way I think that it seems like you're making fun of them but honestly that's that's actually more true than the other way so um so they go they're like okay we can they realize they could buy the rights to the book Think and Grow Rich one of their favorite books uh because it's like it's such an old book that like the like the copyright or whatever had laughs or some like that they could basically buy the rights to it for a hundred thousand dollars so they scrape together savings and they're like we're gonna buy this they buy it for 100 grand in the next three years they make 10 million dollars in sales off that so like really awesome for them but in the grand team of things it turned out to be like kind of like just a base hit compared to what they then go on to take but what what year did they buy the book in the 80s yeah it was uh like early it was kind of like I think early to mid 80s something like that um so like 300 or 100 Grand was like 300 Grand so it's like not a small bet for your first time go ahead one thing leads to another in the infomercial that they create they get Frank Tarkenton the NFL quarterback they're like oh let's get anybody they saw that had mentioned they loved the book Think and Grow Rich they're like hey come be a part of this infomercial and if you the whole information on YouTube you can go watch it in fact I want to do a breakdown Master Class breakdown just on this infomercial but um you can watch the thing and what they do is they don't tell you about the product at the beginning they're like you just hear Frank talking to being like you know I always used to feel blah blah blah but now I'm blah blah and then somebody else comes in and they're like you know I was struggling blah blah and then now I'm about and they don't tell you what's the product that gave them that transformation like this is the genius of marketing is you sell this benefit this transformation you want people banging down your door saying what's the pill what's the product that gives you that right like this is the ozempic thing how the hell are you losing all this weight and it's like oh I take this thing okay you know let me have it let me have the magic pill and so at the end of the video they say it's thinking or Rich they do 10 million dollars in sales over the three years uh by the way this video on YouTube has like 900 views uh like nobody is studying this thing it's crazy to me that's a video like this would have so few views um and they they tell the story around the book that the richest people in the world you know Carnegie the Rothschilds they wanted this guy to write this and so Carnegie commissions what's his name Napoleon Hill to go study the the most successful people in the world and find out their secret and he did right and so that's the that's how they sell this book beautiful in the infomercial this is an awesome infomercial they have one guy come on who's a 24 year old Wonder can this guy is just getting this he's on the up and up Tony Robbins comes on a guy named Anthony Robbins comes on and talks about how he how much he loves the book unpaid by the way they're like hey will you do this I heard you love this book he's like I'll do it does an unpaid spot and they're so blown away by his Charisma on camera that they're like we got to be in the Tony Robbins business next so they go to Tony and they're like hey I love your book we want to do the same thing we didn't think we grow rich but with your book he's like uh okay so they're like we'll brand it we'll figure out the infomercial blah blah they do it they create a program in 1988 the year I was born called personal power and it becomes the best selling self-help program of all time it does 20 million dollars in year one and um you know just goes on to just how old is I'm looking at this I'm looking at this Tony wrap Tony Robbins has the original infomercial on his YouTube YouTube page for the for those personal power how old is he here he's like 25 years older than that that's crazy man he's got a huge job yeah he well he he had a growth uh pituitary growth problem which is why all of his his hands his teeth his jaw are also oversized he's a huge guy if you ever seen him in person I want a pituitary growth problem in life he and he did it I think I think he like it was causing him like to have secrete like 10 times more HGH than he was supposed to and then they removed it at the right time before he became like an actual like nine foot over so like you know he got the benefits of that thing it's amazing he looks awesome man his jawline he looks like the ultimate Chad he looks awesome he's got Charisma of a nice guy but like the looks of a Chad that's that's like that's a killer dude you know I thought that might be your take away from all the things I just said so I'm glad you picked up on the important bit so they do um by 1990 now they're they're three years in they're doing 36 million a year they almost go bankrupt because the Gulf War starts in 91 and all television attention goes to that so the infomercial business just sucks and they have to basically fire everybody just to stay alive during that year because they were um infomercials just not converting the war was was taking everybody's attention so then they go on and they're like okay here's our here's our model and I've watched there's again this uh the research for this was so fun there's interviews with this guy uh if you want to Google it is is uh vanderbund this is the guy who who joined really early he's been the CEO now for like I don't know 15 years really want to meet this guy I want to have him on the Pod he's there's no interviews with these guys really out there they don't go podcasts or anything like that but this guy vanderbund went on um did a talk at some school I think at USC and they chopped up his his talk into one minute clips and I must have binged like 45 one minute Clips last night of this guy I love this guy he's got such a good uh attitude and was saying things but he's like he's like look here's here's our process real simple like uh we find the market need like how do you find it he's like well if you see one person with good skin and one person with bad skin trust me there's a market need like you see some one person with brown teeth another person with white teeth that's gonna be a big Market need and I can just sell it to you by showing before and after so that's the first thing he's like then we find the products and we try to license our own them then we tie them up to a developer or a celebrity or a story because nobody wants to buy from an ivory tower that says we have the solution no they want to buy from a person who says I figured this out I spent my life working on this and I figured this out and uh he's like we we marry the market need with the marketing technique and so the market first marketing technique they did was that infomercial technique that drove them for a long time and now they've shifted to more like internet marketing um since then and like to do the like uh the television just the depths that they went to so they were so early in this they're shooting these um these things for like you know all their brands like they created uh proactive the acne brand with Justin Bieber as one of the celebrities and like these doctors as the celebrities um they created Principal Secret they got this this actress Victoria Principal and um they were like okay we think this is good but we don't know exactly how to sell this product so you know what they did they put her on QVC they were like well that's overpay to be on QVC like is it gonna break even probably not but at QVC if you've ever seen how a QVC thing goes they you can go backstage because during QVC people are calling in to buy and he's like basically on a like 10 second interval you can see what gets people to buy so they did this almost as a study to test the content so they have her talking for an hour and they can see what are the things she's saying that's causing the sales board to light up and they had they took a product that really wasn't working they went and re-shot the infomercial with that Intel of like what what lines and what uh talking points were driving the most interest and then we shot the infomercial and now it's a two billion dollar uh Revenue generating product that they that they created out of that they create a proactive they created a Pilates brand a brand with Cindy Crawford they did all the stuff so they are 100 privately held now no external investors just guilthy and ranker they've been doing this for 30 something years and they do a couple billion in revenue profitably and I was like how is this how did they scale with the outside revenue and then here's the funny thing there's actually a story of like uh you know this is a funny story so they get this along the way they actually did take investment so it's 100 owned now but at one point in time they gave up 33 of the business something to this guy Ron Perlman who himself yeah is a uh prolific guy he owns TV networks he owns Revlon he owns Marvel or he owned Marvel at the time um yeah I think he he's one of the guys who he's hey he's one of the richest men in America I believe I think he's like worth like 40 or 50 like in that range billion and he helped uh I think his buyout of Revlon was the largest leveraged buyout at the time and he was kind of pioneered like the The Leverage buyout uh I read his biography a few years but maybe it's gone up since then um oh I guess previously worth for a while was huge yeah why did we go why did it go down so much maybe because Revlon but I think he I don't even remember what Revlon did I think it was like makeups but it was like a conglomerate like it owned like all this type of stuff but he uh he bought it for many many billions and he kind of pioneered The Leverage buyout which eventually like the American population like it was like one of those things in the 80s where it was like uh like uh just absolute greed and like there's like you know it was like Barbarians at the gate type of Ron Perlman um five marriages yeah there's a price to prepaid the AI That's studying right now that might be like I guess getting married five times causes you to be a billionaire no no it's correlation you know you know how rich the guy is he's got five pages so um okay so they they sell it they sell them to stake he gives them 25 million dollars they're like beautiful and he owns these TV networks they're like oh great we get dirt cheap air time and we get 25 million dollars to invest they use that to grow like crazy pay off these pay celebrities to like be the endorsers like Justin Bieber and all the stuff to do that I think they had Sydney Crawford they had like a a makeup thing with Cindy Crawford I think they have one with Jennifer Lopez they had I think with JLo yeah exactly um eventually Murdoch buys uh buys Ron perlman's uh like TV networks or whatever and then basically they're like oh we get this stake this 37 steak and these guthy Riker things and it just got lost in the Murdoch like uh Empire just uh should we just buy this back and uh they got it back for like you know some tiny amount so I'm like you know they they bought they were able to buy back on 100 of it and then I think now like recently finally they uh I think Goldman bought like a minority stake in the business uh valuing it at three billion um and here's how you know they're they're really rich is a the CEO who you got who you said van what's his name van bunt Vander bun yeah he uh he just bought a 25 million dollar house if you just uh whenever I hear about these people I'm like let's see how rich they really are you can always find out through the real estate holdings he just bought a 25 million dollar house and then Bill Guthrie if you if you Google him he doesn't come up because of this business he comes up because uh Prince and yeah yeah they lived in his estate it's not a house it's a state when they were like you know homeless for a few minutes they like they lived in his estate yeah so and then also he owned a home that one of the gender uh the Kylie Jenner bought so it all comes back to the Kardashians yeah they're they're everywhere at these guys Peak they owned 35 000 toll-free numbers their phone bill was 150 million dollars a year and she's like saying he's like yeah we did that like did you need that he's like we did it for attribution he's like we needed to know what converts better the way we did that was every time we would try a new variation of our content we would give it a new number so we could just attribute which number is getting the most calls and versus the spend and that's how we did our Performance Marketing in the telephone days I thought that was pretty dope as I like them but you're also you didn't even mention their most successful product that everyone who's listening who's at least 30 years old will know this product which one proactive they did proactive I did yeah proactive yeah that's the one they did with Justin Bieber yeah well I think you didn't put enough emphasis I needed to pause bro yeah they did proactive which made like a billion plus I I bought proactive I mean everyone bought Pro did you use it no I didn't use it but uh I watched a bunch of those infomercials their their information is very entertaining like you could just watch it as a show um and actually it was pretty interesting watching uh listening to their method so he's like um he's like you know uh he's he he always says the same thing he goes if you just come to me saying X I can't I can't change this channel fast enough you can just tell that that's like the the guiding principle is like you don't want them to change the channel and it's like everything trickles down from that one principle so he's like it's called the slippery slope baby you got to make them fall down that slippery so he's like uh these guys come in and they start pitching me a cyber safety product and they've been doing it for like seven years it's uh you know the highest it ever gross is a million dollars a year and he's like okay so what's the product he's like cyber safe you know like uh we help make your your computer computers are the new thing um we make your computer safer so you don't get hacked and you don't have a virus on your computer he's like oh man I'm if I'm watching TV relaxing at night the last thing I want to do is get stressed about my problem get stressed about a problem I'm not already stressed about uh which is like oh now my computer's gonna get a virus I'm gonna lose it he's like I couldn't change the channel fast enough he's like but before they walked out of the meeting he goes hey I got a question for you you know we have this thing called need need greed vanity that's what we try to tap into he goes um when you fix the computers to make them safer does that also have any other benefits like does it make it faster and they're like oh yeah for sure because you know no viruses it goes faster he goes hmm all right come back next week and Pitch me the fast thing they come back and then they launch this product called double my speed and yeah that business that had never done more than a million dollars in seven years all of a sudden does 75 million dollars a year at the time he was given this interview which is a while back um for double my speed and he's like you know I just he's like I just he goes there's too many smart people and they're like how did you do it did you do like Internet advertising for this computer product he's like no we did radio ads and it was just a radio infomercial he's like you know I he's like there's too many smart people online he's like I don't want to compete in a knife fight unless I have a gun and he's like so we went to the radio because really no smart people were advertising on the radio and we could just get a bunch of inventory for cheap and uh we could just create content that was better than the the current stuff on radio and I was like man this guy's awesome um they were like how are they doing now with uh infomercials not being as relevant so he talked a little bit about it but I don't know there's not that much info out there um but he goes he's so he's they were like how'd you make this a success you know you you they're like vent this guy whatever his name is Vander buns's last name and they're like uh you joined at what Revenue he's like it was 12 million a year he's like what is it now he's like uh like 1.7 billion they're like oh amazing you hear that the whole audience is like wow you know that's amazing he's like he's like yeah when you say it like that it sounds crazy he's like but uh you don't see that far he's like when you're at 12 you could he's like what's that phrase like you can you can't see Beyond the Wall that's in front of you he's like when you're at 12 all you think about is 25 and you just there's some wall between you and 25 and then you break through that wall and then 25 wants to get to 60. and like there's another wall to get to 60s like you just keep doing that we just did that over and over and over again until you until you figure out like you know the right thing he's like and he's like for six years when we were doing the infomercial thing we were so early to that channel we were just the best at that channel he's like honestly we didn't learn that much during that time he's like all the learning came in these like he he says this funny joke he's like um he's like there was some year where like infomercial started to tank the internet started getting more popular he's like we had 30 million people that were on a reorder program meaning he's like our business model is we get you interested in a product you call up our phone we pick up and we tell you that that product's gonna be great for you and that we may have some other products that are great for you and actually you know what if you do this right now we'll keep sending you this product for the rest of your life he's like that's like the business model and he's like uh he's like it felt like one day all 30 million people on our reorder program called each other and we're like you know what let's cancel this and he's like he's like the way the world was caving in he's like then we had to get smart again and figure out like oh we haven't even had to fight to win in so long let's figure let's be smart and let's figure this out and uh and you know I just think these guys that these guys have built an amazing business and nobody really talks about them at least in our circles well they don't talk about it because hey like it's not sexy I mean the money part is sexy because like when I you make this sound so cool but in reality this probably looks like Workaholics you remember that TV show Workaholics how they're just sitting around making phone calls that's probably what the office looks like we're just a bunch of like morons like sitting in this shitty cubicle wearing like a badly fitting tie and suit like just answering these calls I mean that's like not that fun to do like on a day-to-day basis I imagine it's really fun when it's crushing it though um they also don't get talked about because they've been around forever it looks like the company was launched in 88 and before that they were doing different stuff so it's been around for 40 years now right um but yeah I love these guys I want to know what they're doing with digital because I remember like remember P90X that's another company it's called something Beach what's it called uh Beachbody it so they own they're just like Guthrie Baker but they own like P90X style companies and they owned a bunch of them and I remember them well you know what they did they pivoted yeah they to because the internet was like coming around and they're like we have to keep up and so now they have like a it's almost like a Netflix style business it's an ml subscription so basically they change the sales model from this direct response infomercial model to MLM so now they have Beachbody trainers and a Beachbody Associates that will sell people to join Beachbody right so they get people to post on social media that they've uh not only have they gotten in shape they now work for themselves they are independent uh and they're making more money than they were ever working before and if you're interested in kind of hearing how you change how you turned your life around like decide into the DMS and then they basically sell you that like you too should start selling Beachbody programs to people around you and you can make a lot of money and be fit um and dude that's the worst that that totally like because I remember when I was in Australia uh when I was living there I didn't have a gym I did P90X I did like I I did it I thought it was awesome but when you go the MLM route it makes me hate you yeah it wasn't there Tony Tony Horton uh Tony was ripped Tony Horton was ripped like some side characters but it was like you know whatever he'd be like the chat the chef is here the the Russian blah blah blah those guys dude great program I wonder what he looks like now is he still yeah yeah he's still jacked I think he has something yeah he looks great disease he got some disease and then kind of bounce back or something well he still looks amazing if you Google Tony Horton he's 65 years old now he looks great uh so it worked um but anyway I'm a big I like these I like studying these companies I also like studying them because a lot of people in the tech startup world are like well this doesn't work anymore and I'm like wrong it 100 does maybe it looks a little different we'll do this whatever slicy econ business doing right like that's what they're the thing the first business I featured which was uh you know the greed family doing this with the Kardashians creating a shaper brand of the Kardashians this is no different you know the Cosmetics brand with Kent with uh you know Kylie Jenner there's no different than what guthy Rinker has been doing they just used Instagram instead of an Instagram and Instagram celebrities instead of Hollywood celebrities and TV it's the same model same same thing so this one's a great you win this one's definitely the most interesting one um it's incredibly fascinating one thing that I was trying to research that I couldn't find and I think there's a bunch of people in our world working on this is everything that we've discussed it's mostly consumer products what I'm curious is why this hasn't worked for like a more of a B2B product so in a weird way we aren't this but hubs yeah bro you're like a fish being like what is water it's like yeah we are this for HubSpot you know that yeah but we're not we're not the founders of the company you know we're not we're not like oh you know Kylie Jenner in this case right they basically yeah but Kylie Jenner owns 50 of that we you know I I we gotta renegotiate one percent yeah and so I don't own that much of HubSpot but uh I remember the uh what was the company that did this with the what was the Rackspace they did it with a guy uh what was this Robert scoble they were early with that but I don't know if it worked out wonderfully or what happened to that but there's not I know there's a few other companies so there's um assembly Brands I worked with this guy hunter so we launched this thing called viral Cuts where I own part of the company and it's like a agency that Clips uh uh podcast Clips but it's gonna be small it's not going to be a multi-billion dollar company like that I wonder why Shepherd is a good business it's like it's a business that fits our audience right every entrepreneur needs to hire people if you can hire talented people overseas for 10 times less like this is like a no-brainer product so Shepard was already working and then they bring me on and now I own a piece of that company enough of us you are the Cindy Crawford they looked at me a little funny when I said it but I you know this is what I bet and uh you know since we joined uh you know first it was Nick Huber was doing it with him no you're more like the Chloe you're the you're the club you're the Chloe man you're the Chloe oh that's good hey plus uh um but it's the same thing bring on kind of like a influencer to promote a B2B product and revenue all-time high last month all-time high this month right like it just keeps happening now every single month uh by doing that and so it's a I think it is happening more in the B2B space and that's why it's happening more but it's not nearly as common and I think it will be or should be it's a big opportunity for sure um the thing that uh the thing is interesting so Austin Reef tweeted this out over the weekend I don't know if you saw him say this he said every uh I think he said D to C though I think he said every like e-commerce company is going to have a content creator that's high more highly paid than many of the executives so uh he says over the next five years every DDC business will have full-time content creators on staff the best will be comped more than the execs and drive more value than anyone else in the business the math is going to make sense to hire build and invest in creators who can become a part of your company narrative versus spinning off one-off influencer campaigns the key difference between being between a Creator and a social media manager a social media manager just creates a post content a Creator is the content and of course the best companies will be founded by creators like happy Dad feastables Prime Etc when people are here Creator they think of Mr Beast or Logan Paul I'm not referring to famous creators just people who create content full-time and um this is something that we're seeing with our uh DC business but in general I think this is I think you just need to take out the word d2c right darmesh had the same Insight he goes every software company is going to have its own Media Company why because creating your own media is going to bring inbound is going to bring inbound leads um and it's going to be more a more efficient Channel than doing outbound paid ads or it's going to be it and dartmesh is sort of like that with HubSpot I mean like uh people like actually our most popular episodes are darmesh uh so he's like pretty much doing that for his own company yeah exactly exactly um okay you want to do you have more or you want me to do one you want to do one more or let's do Scott Storage yeah okay I wasn't sure if that was in the same category but I want to talk about it so here's another version of the guy behind the scenes the engine that makes the thing work we did it with business with d2c products well how about music so uh this guy's going viral recently uh for a bunch of tick tocks because he's got an amazing story this guy Scott Storch he is a pretty sober now and he's like he's like out of the key he's like left the cave he's a producer he's a songwriter and he's famous for a couple of things he produced some of the biggest hits like you know Still Dre you know the little piano keys at the beginning is Still Dre that's Scott Storage was sitting on a piano did it and Dr Dre was in a kitchen eating a sandwich poked his head and he goes That's it um that's how Still Dre uh the track I love those stories I love those stories he did candy shop he did naughty girl he did a bunch of songs with everybody you can imagine Beyonce Dr Dre 50 Cent Snoop Dogg Busta Rhymes Justin Timberlake Chris Brown all of them um he's amassed a Fortune of about a hundred million dollars doing this as a producer behind the scenes that you didn't know about that was CR just killing it and he's also famous for blowing all 100 million because he got he got addicted to two things spending and cocaine and um and he was basically just partying too much blowing through all his money and now he reset so he he you know he went to rehab got clean declared bankruptcy basically and came back um you know and now is is trying to rebuild again and so this guy's story I thought was pretty crazy what do you know about this guy yeah so we did a bunch of interviews lately where he was like I was spending two three four five million dollars a month he was like I had houses that I forgot about he said we had this one house and he goes I had a five thousand dollars worth of like glass figurines so you were collecting like cars or shoes he goes I collected everything that could be collected he goes stuff I didn't even care about I was like I had a million dollars of Crystal figurines it was like they I had a party and they fell over and we just like sweeped him up at the desk because I had a 500 000 Crystal bottle of perfume and the guy was like do you even wear it he goes nah some drunk girl at a party knocked it over and broke it and he's like he had a four million dollar pinky ring if four million dollars diamond pinky ring and like you need to step down because Scott Storage has it done he is a character in Grand Theft Auto because he's so prolific as a guy in Miami who's like you know in in the scene there's this one uh story uh from 2013 where he says he spent something like a hundred million dollars one one says 30 million dollars once is 100 million dollars in six months uh he's like cocaine houses and cars yeah uh they just went hard yeah so like I love stories like this by the way I like it because hopefully this will have a happy ending but I just love people that fly close to the sun because he dropped out of ninth grade you know that so he dropped out of ninth grade and you know how he made his original like how he broke onto the scene oh he was the keyboard guy for the roots so he's in ninth grade he drops out teaches himself how to play the piano um and he's like yeah they're like you didn't take any courses he's like no I mean I could afford a class he's like I actually enrolled in one class but I couldn't afford to get to it so I was like ah I guess I'm just not gonna like you know just I'll just try to sit here he's like I would I would have a a tape player and I'll put it on the piano and I would hear it he's like then with one finger I'd be like trying to recreate what I just heard he's like and I just did that until I could learn how to play the keyboards like by ear he's like so then he discovers the roots before they were big he joins them and he's the only he's the white boy in The Roots and they're just going and playing like literally on like corners and like he's like playing in the corner he'd go you know they'd go down to New York and they would play for a day and then come back to Philly and he would just do that all the time the roots start getting popular they get signed but then he leaves the roots and they're like why do you want to leave the roots you say man I heard that's that white boy from The Roots one too many times and he's like they don't even know my name he's like I'm gonna go create my own music so he he's like I'm gonna create my own music through the roots he had met Dr Dre so he goes and he hangs out Dr Dre and Dre's like yo this guy's got talent and so he he makes some songs with Dr Dre and Dr Dre at this time is the biggest producer in the world he's the most high-end demand guy so Scott Storch makes his 100 million dollar Fortune as he says off the uh eating crumbs at the end of the table so basically Dre would get a project and he's like really picky he's like I'm just gonna I'm not gonna do just anything he's like so he would just take all of Dr Dre's reject projects and do them himself and made 100 million dollars doing that and dude how good is Dr Dre by the way the fact that like when when Eminem came around you know he raps about it he's like you walked in with a yellow jumpsuit and you're a white guy and everyone's like dude you can't you can't play with this guy what do you what are you kidding white rappers that's ridiculous if you Google Scott Storage my wife's from Long Island so I've gotten a bunch of Long Island people this guy looks like there's the Long Island Medium and then there's Scott Storch in terms of like in like the way that they look in terms of stereotypes it looks like most Long Island guy ever wearing like Ed Hardy t-shirts and True Religion jeans and Dr Dre like sees past that and like sees Talent that's pretty amazing exactly and he even says that he's like Dre's number one skill he's like he's very technically talented but his skill is he can hear 10 things and he'll tell you which one is hot and he's like we'll play the same thing five different times and he's like number four is the one that sounds the best and he's like uh Dre just has that ear for what's good and what's hot what's next and what's different what's unique what's singular what's gonna stand out he's like I never had that to that extent he's like but you know I was good I I was able to get good enough where I could still make you know hundreds of hits he would get paid a hundred grand to do a single track and he would do 10 a week and when and you know in his prime that's what he was doing that's how he was making his money so he's like dude I'm just rolling in money here and then he stopped working he's like I'm just gonna party now he's like the problem was like I was spending like I was still making money but I stopped working three years ago and I was just spending money like crazy and um yeah this guy's so here's some quotes I'd like to read you okay on blowing 100 million dollars quote it happens when you you talk about blowing 100 million I know cats that blew double that that's the second response it continues it can happen to anyone I don't think you could have it anyone and then he says and he says you know I grew up a poor kid and then all of a sudden I have infinite money I have no I have infinite options and I just didn't know how to say no um so then he uh they were asking about like you know how do you make a hit song he just goes like you know in the in the real estate game it's location location location and the music game it's Melody Melody Melody he goes it's Melody Melody Melody if you can make a memorable Melody that's that's what it takes to make a hit song and that's what I focused on being able to do um so yeah this guy's Scott Storage is a prolific character well he he'll be back I mean I feel like if you have that skill you can make it work uh for you can make it work for a while right I mean it's just it's very similar to marketing if it's it's like if you understand what what motivates people and gets them to get gets them to act whether it's dancing or buying something you'll you'll come back have you ever met these guys like like they'll be guys like oh man I just uh I got a hold of uh all these old rookie cards uh for this baseball player who's about to die we should like go and buy all of them for 50 Grand and like hold on to them for three weeks and then we sell more I just got this old like you know supply of like DVD players it's only 50 Grand like they're always into schemes like I always meet these guys like love these schemes every once in a while it works out and this is like a guy Scott Stewart who's like he'll you'll you'll meet this guy you're like dude you're an idiot no way that's gonna work like quit trying to scam me this is one of those guys who's made it work you know another guy who did it that way was the Dollar Shave Club guy you know it actually Dollar Shave Club came to be a thing because he like saw a discount on like a container of like cheap razors and he's like we'll just buy these oh wow yeah he's like let's just get those cheap razors and just figure out how to sell them I don't know how we're gonna do it I think his father-in-law like had a deal on like 50 000 razors and he's like uh screw it let's just do it I've met a bunch of these people like this for some reason it's always a Long Island thing by the way and uh and Scott Storage is a is a for everyone out there who's just scheming on these types of like weird weird things this is your hero um you know what I'm talking about you ever meet these guys and they always have some weird hustle going down Counting Cars I'm trying to win the Monopoly game at McDonald's you know we uh we're entering contests we realized that most people don't enter contests if there's any work so like um my buddy Dan was amazing at this I actually wrote him off and then later learned this guy's a genius he freshman year this guy lives Three Doors Down for me and um we're like yo we're gonna go get food and then like we're like who are we waiting for where's Dan and we like go to his don't we go into his room we're like Dan let's go man we're supposed to we're hungry he's like oh hold on um the deadline for this contest is in like 30 minutes I gotta I I'm out and I'm like what contest why are you gonna take a contest and uh like Duke is full of like kids who play by the book and Dan never really played by the book he was like he had his own little book that he was playing in and so you know he he he's like oh this is Stride Gum he's like Stride Gum will give you free gum for life if you can make a commercial for like a 20 second commercial that's like cool for Stride Gum so he took a little like flip cam like it wasn't even smartphones back then he took one of those flip cams and he basically like filmed this commercial of himself in his dorm room being like whatever Stride Gum the best goddamn gum in the world brother he's like doing this commercial he submits it he's probably one of three people that actually like read the fine print submitted a did the work to submit a commercial with that that filled in all the thing and guess what Stride Gum for everybody for the rest of college right we had free stride Gump really he won he did another one he's like um wait what type of package did the gum come in what's gum forever like they literally you can just order an infinite amount basically um like you could just keep ordering by some some limits um then you did another one for this sandwich shop called Spicy Pickle they're like hey we're renaming our mascot and of course Dan's over there trying to rename the mascot I'm like Dan do you even like this restaurant he's like no but you I want to win and I'm like you know he's like the definition of like play stupid games win Super prizes but he has so much goddamn fun doing it that you're like ah I kind of wish I was doing this like Dan and so he renamed so the mascot currently for Spicy Pickle is a pickle who's a spy called spy the letter c pickle and he's got a business card and he's a spy that will help you out and that's Dan Dan created that character and then we go we go to like the ceremony at a Spicy Pickle headquarters uh and they're like 20 people in a circle cheering clapping for him and they hand him a big check that says like free sandwiches and he wins and so he just kept doing these things a dance from Jersey and um and I feel like he just always had this thing which was like I'm gonna win like I'm gonna play these like I'm gonna find these random edges and I'm gonna win like I'm gonna just find these little arbitrages and I'm gonna constantly exploit them dude we should do an episode on this because have you read about the guy who did it with Snack Pack like put pudding cups like you remember you know like putting okay so they they ran this contest that says like I forget exactly how the contest worked but you could like uh if you pulled off the tops of the pudding and like lick it it like said like you won this much in free airline miles and there was like some contest around it but this guy did the math where I'm just I just had to Google it now to remember exactly but he only had to buy I think 3 500 worth of pudding which is like a significant amount in terms of like how much space it would take up in your room and he like had all this putting and he peeled all the packs and he was able to redeem it for 1.2 million miles airline miles and he like gamed the contest and there's I like we at the hustle we used to do this with people like gaming these contests there's like a bunch of people there's this community of people who go and find these contests and they're like all right where did they make the mistake where if you follow this exactly you could actually like milk it hardcore to the extreme and there was a guy who did this with pudding so he basically it was it was basically you get a thousand miles for every 10 labels and the because the whole thing was like for some reason this pudding is supposed to be healthy and so they said if you eat a lot of it it's good for you and we're gonna reward you by giving you a thousand miles for every 10 labels and so the there was two dollars a piece he figured out that he could buy them in bulk and he's like here's this Arbitrage where it's profitable and he did that where he got 1.2 million miles for 3 100 wow there's a Netflix show about this uh about about a different version of this some guy trying to do this with a I think he had to buy cans of Pepsi or something like that or Coke or something to do Airline there's some show I haven't watched it yet but I saw it uh show up on on uh on Netflix yeah then there's the McDonald's one there's a McDonald's one too where they where they like that was just a scam they just they scammed it uh yes but it is fascinating I I do like reading about those they're always fun stories we should one of these days we'll do an episode of all these people who have just gained the system we used to do that to hustle all the time where we would give I forget what it was it was like one email subscriber to us was worth ten dollars and if you referred like 10 people we would send you a t-shirt which was a profitable thing for us and if you Google the hustle affiliate contest all of these moms have there was mostly like a stay-at-home mom website and it's called like coupon Dash or like some of all these websites where it's just people who enter contests and they're like hey look here's another one you can win a free pair of socks if you if you refer 50 people and it was like referral like rings and we would get all of these people doing this and we and we would catch this and we're like why is like this like a 38 year old woman named Cindy winning all of our prizes we've never heard of her she's won all this stuff what's going on and you like can figure out that they list your contest on these websites and they game it like crazy it's a pretty wild thing so we had to create like a double opt-in system because they just figured out they're like you see them talking about like look you don't even need to opt in your email so you can just write like Sean plus one at AOL.com seanplus2 aol.com and you just win and so that's when we had to change it but like that's how I learned a little bit about this underground world of like sweepstakes they call it yeah yeah Sweepstake hackers uh amazing all right should we wrap it there or do we want to do any more of these we'll wrap it there so I think the order of greatness the least interesting one I think it was either mine or the hot couple the second the perfect couple we're gonna put the perfect couple down there because they've been winning at everything their whole life yeah but it'll go perfect yeah the perfect couple is the worst this is sort of like ugly winners yeah like the sort of like more ugly and like you know slightly Shady you are the higher you seem to rank on my first million I don't know if that's intentional or unintentional but it's definitely definitely happens yeah so the hot people they're your last uh and then we'll go Robert Earl and then the one above that is uh oh Scott's storage is gonna go number two Guthrie ranker number one the juiciest but Scott Storch is interesting too but Guthrie raker I think there's more to learn all right so that's it that's the pod [Music]

the greatest competition is life my mom said to me once when I was a kid if you can't be true to yourself you can't be true to anyone else and so I thought let me see if I say hey I can stop drinking anytime and then the next day I drink or the next week or the next month then I really don't have a lot of power over all the dumbest things I ever did were when I was drinking so that was a discipline thing and that's a continuation of trying to get better

on average a million streams is around four thousand dollars USD on Spotify on Spotify and we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now things are just pretty crazy and I don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music you hear there's no money in streaming but I'm like that's because labels own 80 of your songs but if you own your songs there's a ton of money in streaming [Music] laughs okay welcome first um so I don't know what the real intro of this is gonna be but I I wanted to introduce this to you guys uh Sam had put this on the calendar like Hey we're recording with Connor and uh Brianna and I think he those you guys in person or real life or whatever and he kind of loosely said I was he said something like oh I was like is that the rapper kind of music person and then what I was doing the prep for this I was like oh it's these these people oh my God I love I love your stuff I am so excited for this uh as you can probably tell because I'm screaming but I'm so excited for this because I think what you do is literally amazing I think it is so smart and I think it is so impressive what you've done um you know we've had the chance to talk to Mr beason's podcast and we've talked to Hassan minhaj in the comedy World we've talked to some Cody Co on the YouTube side who you kind of look like I think you know that um but I do I gotta say I think you are playing Tick Tock like a fiddle I think you have figured out like the thing every platform that comes out there's like there's like the people that like kind of come from the old world onto that and just kind of try to do the same thing but maybe shorter or faster or video or whatever um and then there's people who figure out that medium for what it is and I think you figured out how to do music on Tick Tock like nobody else um I don't know if you're a marketing genius or if you fell into that but either way it's working and therefore I am so excited to have this conversation because last night you could tell I'm kind of tired because I was binging your content and I was just so inspired I was so inspired I don't do anything in the music world I bet 99 of the listeners don't do anything in the music world but I was so inspired just by what you were doing so that's my intro of just uh Fanboy because I can't believe how good you guys are what you do that was the nicest intro well thank you so much yeah no as far as the marketing stuff goes that's all Brianna um which is why it's so fun to be able to do this conversation with her um because we we do everything together uh but so so many of my ideas that have gone viral are her ideas so let's give people a little context and we could either explain it or I do think it would be better to literally just show it so I'm gonna I love the show method so I have a bunch that I liked um dude you know how much I like this I was last night so I'm doing this on my laptop and I'm not logged into Tick Tock and I kept hitting the like button and like you know I was like trying to like it and it's like create an account and I almost created a second account just to give you the like because I was so I felt like you deserved it uh like oh thank you even when you feel like someone earned it that's how I felt I love it play a video play one of the videos yo yo yo what is he oh yeah so he was telling me that if you uh if you cut a carrot a certain way you can play it like a flute he really thinks it's gonna work apparently it's a thing just ignore him ready uh yeah do me a favor pull up [Music] pull up that one session yeah look they said that I couldn't do it so I wouldn't do it did it W's only you know I've been winning top of the world the globe is spinning spinning if you know you know I've been on it okay let's get it got a little time on my hands like a wrist watch I don't got time for the brakes and the pit stop breaks through the gridlock take it like Chris right to the chance to win heavy metals like Slipknot got to drive and I got tunnel vision I just hit my stride the way I run the business I've been making paper like I'm done to Memphis see the end game I got one division look I don't ever bother with a Critic hit him with a Chronicle already boom so you create these these little like um opening skits and you'd you don't hit them like okay traditional way of doing things somebody wants to be a musician they're going to fire up Tick Tock and they're gonna just play their song maybe they play the song with a music video already baked in and if me if it's me and I'm just hearing the opening of a song it's usually pretty slow there's a little bit of a build up um you know just like the just a little bit of instrumental playing at the beginning or they might say hey I'm Sean this is my new track give it a listen right kind of boring sort of begging for attention whereas you have these little opening skits that gets you curious of what's gonna happen you're playing all these characters like you know Eddie Murphy in uh whatever that movie was you're sitting here Tyler Perry and you're playing all the characters and then then you hit them with a track that's actually like surprisingly good for how simple the intro is I don't know how how to explain it but this is how you got famous for doing this stuff on Tick Tock sure yeah no so I make music um specifically in the kind of hip-hop rap World a little bit of Pop sometimes but yeah so with the whole goal with these videos is to not make it seem like you're selling someone especially on Tick Tock the moment you feel like someone's like hey check out my song you're going to swipe away so you have to provide entertainment first and we have found the best way to do that is through skits and it was really easy because Connor's been acting since he was six years old so it was the perfect way to kind of merge those two worlds and it it worked yeah I saw you were in a bunch of like well good luck Chuck a bunch of yeah a bunch of movies I started acting when I was six in Toronto where I grew up started with commercials when I was 10 I did a movie called Cinderella Man I played the son of Russell Crowe in that film and that was kind of the first huge project I was ever a part of first time I went to LA for the premiere signed with the US agent and so from a kid I've just been doing TV and film my whole life and then when covet hit and production shut down I was like what do we do I was working at Alpha paw at the time the pet company um I left that job and then I was like okay Conor's really good at rapping he's he's loved hip-hop for so many years why don't we try marketing that and he didn't want to because he thought Tick Tock was kind of lame like it was in the era where people just did those little dances so yeah I took some YouTube videos he had filmed turned them into vertical pieces of content he's like I'm a thespian I'm not going to be on Tick Tock I'm an actor films my biggest regret is not starting sooner on like social media specifically I'd always been anti that once he saw a video go viral and then it translates to streams the next day he's like okay maybe we can do it I changed everything yeah every every time yeah let's pause for a sec yeah we got to say the background here because people said Alpha Paul so basically I I'm friends with Ramon who then became me Sean Ramon are all buddies Ramon is on episode two or three or four Sean talks to him he had a pet it's episode two he had a soap opera company and then a pet company I remember Ramon bought this pet business that seemed outlandish at the time turned into a successful business I went to Vegas to hang out with them I think I was there regardless and I just went to hang out to the office Brianna was his right-hand woman running marketing and everything else at the company I go to this brand new office set he has and remote's like uh Connor is Brianna's wife she he's actually just gonna help us move he's uh trying to make it are you trying to make it everyone told me that you showed up like uh high on drugs because you were afraid of flying so you're like you're like dope I hated flying and I took up I took too much medicine and I got to I like I was still figuring out the dosage and I got to the office I was like I gotta go to sleep so I was like all messed up I was like I'm sorry guys I'm like intoxicated but I I remember meeting when I was moving yeah yeah he was moving boxes like you were because you were an actor and you were in between and you're just moving and then like months later he Ramone was like hey remember Brianna's wife her husband she uh he's like trying to actually become a rapper and he's actually good and I'm like the guy moving what really I I don't buy it I I don't buy it and then you had like some traditional rap music videos and I'm like okay he actually is quite good then uh Ramon was like hey uh Brianna's actually left Alpha Paul and she and she's gonna take over his and then I start seeing a tick talks and I'm like oh my God this guy's the best and then you blew up and now it looks like you have like eight million monthly lessons on your Spotify he remote's telling me that you guys are independent yeah so you like own all the music and he's like saying like dude they're numbers for Revenue are outlandish you can say if you want or not but like they're making a really good living now Conor's going on tour he's with Hoodie Allen he's in Europe he's selling out shows in Europe and now you're like legit famous he looks like your top song spinning has 105 million downloads the other one is 74 million like you guys are killing it and I knew you just as this nice guy who was moving boxes and this was only I think this was three years ago this wasn't long enough first time we met was at a comedy show five years ago in 2018. do you remember that it was like a Chris Delia show and then yeah you came to the office I think you and I were like butting heads that day and then Ramon's like oh he's just on drugs and I'm like okay that makes sense yeah well Ramon told me yeah voice message to me last night he's like yeah same same game office but he was like you know a little bit like doped up from the the flight and he goes you know Sam normally asks like pretty direct questions like add drugs oh Sam was getting behind everyone's laptops like what are you doing what are you doing and I'm like I don't remember that I don't remember that I'm sorry you're making my team nervous as hell and Brianna you don't know this but uh I also saw your work before we ever met because you were behind a lot of the ads so Alpha paw scaled like crazy so Ramon bought this business that's a dog ramp business initially so it was literally like it was called sausage dogs that's right wow which is also what they used to call my dorm in college but but then so well played so then um it's like little dogs use the ramp to get up on the bed or on the couch or down from the couch I have four of them in my house because I got a little dog and I also know Ramon so he sent me four four free ramps so there was uh so these rants are great but I was like how do you sell these like are people looking for these he's like no most people don't realize they want it so we gotta like make ads that teach them that they want it and I was just getting into Ecom I had I was Ramon's the reason I started an econ brand because I was sitting at his house hearing the Shopify Ching cha ching on this phone I was like dude I want that noise in my life how do you do that so I decided to start one and to help me he goes he's like here um I added you to my ads account which is like basically like adding you as a co-signer on a bank account basically nobody gives their Facebook ad account to somebody else but that's very intimate Simone is that kind of guy that kind of friend and so I'm in the ad account and I'm looking at all your ads that you created because you had all these video ads that were working to sell pee pads and ramps and all this stuff and I was like damn I need somebody who's good at creating ads and I think was is it right that you were just kind of like at that warehouse or you would just like come up with the concept yourself and figure out like test them is that kind of where you got this like quick video you and your sister it was mainly myself and Catherine do you remember Catherine um Catherine and I ran the marketing and then my little sister would help me but basically we would just try and like either pull at someone's heart strings like we would start a video with maybe an injured dog and then instantly a person that has an injured dog can relate to that and they're like all like and then we show the solution and then a cute little dog we literally bought a Chihuahua she's upstairs just to use like for marketing ads and we would show her trying to jump up on the couch and instantly everyone that has a Chihuahua is like oh my dog does the same thing boom here's a solution and it just freaking worked it was wild like I've I couldn't believe it we went from an office as big as a bathroom to like a 20 000 square foot Warehouse within a year yeah I was I was doing a lot of moving Connor was moving a lot Conor would help film he would help edit the ads yeah it was a family production and then all the high performing ads we filmed in either our living room or Chloe's living room yeah in our house and then when I was like okay I really want to do my own thing we want to start a family I need to leave this pet company it broke my heart for Mom's my best friend but I had to ultimately leave and I was trying to start other companies I'm like what can I start I started like a coffee brand a like a Christian brand and then our friend Cliff Weitzman he's the CEO of speechify oh we know I believe you know I love Cliff he says hello I was talking to him this morning I said I was going to be on him yeah Cliff was over for dinner and I was just venting my frustrations of product boredom and he's like Bree stop like this is your product he's like Kris Jenner the out of him so the next day I stopped I had a huge order an inventory of coffee and I let it go to waste and I'm like we're going all in on this and I pretty much just use the same mindset I used to sell the dog ramps to sell his music it's like how can we hook someone in and how can we tell a story around this song because a lot of Music These Days is just like a really cool beat and like some generic lyrics right but I'm like there's a lack of Storytelling and I think that's what music online is missing and we did it so and we're doing it independently so so you can see it because as I was doing my my binge I can't even call it research I was just enjoying myself going down I did the Tour de France down your profile the first video actually on your YouTube channel is pretty dope I don't know Sam have you seen the very first video that they the first song that he posted is it is that the one where you rap about how you have a sweater yeah yeah yes yeah yeah what is it called the s word or what is it would you call it it's just s just the letter s um so you rap about how you used to have a stutter and then yeah in the song You're basically every like a bunch of the words start with s and uh by the way you sent me down a Watsky Rabbit Hole two last night like we love huge huge inspiration for that I've never heard of him he's dope um so anyways the that's the first song and it's like okay this person clearly has talent but also it's like I don't know that's different yeah it's never been easier to go on I don't know Froot Loops and make a beat and and then and then try to try to rap and like do 15 seconds of a good rap like that's I guess never been easier would you say like it's kind of more competitive than ever to do that part totally totally I mean there's what 60 000 songs uploaded everything could be more I think the data is closer to 100 now but roughly I'd say does we save 60 000 songs uploaded every day yeah they the the the ease of being able to make music now especially in the hip-hop space with with um programs like Fruity Loops where you can find samples yeah um it's yeah a lot of people are making music way more efficiently than ever you can see like kind of the progression like okay are you getting some views you're putting out some good tracks but like there was all I could almost draw a line and be like then they figured out how to create like hooks for these videos yeah it was the presentation everything was different after that is that when you joined uh Brianna like is that kind of when you Chris gendered the out of them yeah that's when I really stopped trying to do a million things and focus just on him and the biggest moment for us was creating a series that's when we started the spin the globe Series where he would spin a globe and land on a country and collab with an artist that took us from like here to like yeah that took off like crazy that that first video that we did where we landed on Zambia and found the Zambian artist that that video has 72 million views on Tick Tock and 72 million views on YouTube shorts so explain that video yes yes so it was an idea where I had this song with this artist named Killa who's this independent artist from Zambia when we first worked with him he had less than a thousand monthly listeners had 189 monthly listings and now he's over a million because that song which is incredible wow and it's like changed changed his life um but essentially we were like all right how can we Market this and I was like all right we need a strong hook in the first two to three seconds sure no please do yeah yeah all right I'm gonna spin this globe and wherever my finger lands I'm gonna find an artist from that country to collaborate with me on a song and see what happens Zambia all right well let's find out more about zandia I started researching some up-and-coming artists and one guy really stood out to me his name is Killa he's a rapper from Lusaka which is the capital of Zambia I felt like his style and his voice would sound perfect on the song I'm working on so I reached out to him I sent him the beat and then a few days later he sent me back I know a lot of people praying for my downfall but the only thing that I'll be down for is being top five but like Downs four I'm down to earth like the ground floor but I've been flying so long I tend to ask people what's the ground for man I'm only headed up see my flow volcanic justify I erupt heard the fans getting rowdy cause they haven't had enough you know I'm running the city you're just running out of luck yeah I said that with my chest so that whole thing five seconds there like the speed that you hit him with that initial hook like you're already started you're like mid word you're like all right I'm gonna spin this globe now you're doing something interesting visually and then you set up the premise the stakes of like wherever my finger lands I'm gonna find an artist and do a song with them which okay I've never heard of that before so where does this idea come from and like how much time times you put into that first getting that first five seconds to be good I was literally at the gym with Connor's mom and I thought of it and I texted him I said I'm start I'm stopping at Target we're grabbing a globe here's the idea and his mom parked the car I ran and got it it was like 19 bucks and to be honest at the time we didn't realize it would blow up and we posted on a Sunday and it got three million views the same day and I'm like oh okay this is a series we have to do this again and instantly I went on my phone I'm like what country's next and I searched hashtag Dutch rap because I really wanted a Dutch artist I think that language is so beautiful and I found this guy named Benz then we did episode two two weeks later and boom that's spinning in it that's the song that now has over 100 million streams on Spotify in less than nine months that's so insane it is insane yeah so that first one that that you were just playing um it really was just like okay how do we make content around the song what's the contentable moment and what's something visual what's something visual we can do right so for spinning like the the other one you played with the carrot flute it was that idea of like all right this fluid is such a strong element of the song I remember watching a video back in the day where someone made it no no no no Christian our brother-in-law was making a carrot food at Christmas and we're like you're an idiot what are you doing and it actually ended up working and I'm like what if we bring that into the video right and then that's what made the song now people like call him like the carrot flute guy and I'm like what so for this one the contensible moment for us was like all right we have this artist myself from Canada we have this other artist from Zambia a country that most people don't even know where it is on the map so you you actually you actually knew the artist you had the artist idea first you're like how do we tell the story of that almost in reverse engineer the story correct for this one we had the song first for every other one we were like we had no idea this was going to blow up all our content that it performed well at this point was Skits and every time we posted a non-skit it never did as well so we really were just like let's see what happens I was very much inspired by like content creators like um Mr Beast yeah as you can tell from like the whole editing style and I edit them my tick tocks and so like the one word at a time I love how in videos it starts the first frame you hear all right guys today we're gonna blah blah blah he just gets into it right away and so I was inspired by that hence uh this intro yeah the first one we had the relationship with the Zambian artist first but after the first episode it was very organic and we found the artists like literally two days before the song was recorded and why do you think this video popped off like that I think the hook is really strong I'm gonna spin this globe wherever my finger lands it's like all right where what's about to happen is he gonna go there um immediately you're interested where he's gonna land right and it's it's visual you see a spinning globe now now you're gonna stick around and see all right let's see where it lands I land on a country like Zambia something most people haven't heard of and I say I'm going to collaborate with an artist now there's another hook of oh what's this guy going to look like what's he gonna sound like what's the song gonna sound like and then they stick around today it's even going to be good right totally and how many times did you have to spin that Globe to land on sale oh gosh I couldn't even tell you way too many times yeah that's another good Tick Tock like uh yeah every every couple seconds like every four to five seconds there's just something new there's like a new like if you're thinking of leaving you're like okay wait maybe I'll stay oh I'm thinking of leaving oh wait I want to see him oh he's about to start I'll stay like there's even with the carrot flute video you'll notice every time there's like a dull moment we have a of the drill right and it's like oh I'm staying like the weird brother pops in and like surprises it's like every kind of 45 seconds two or three seconds almost like the attention is about to lapse open up a new curiosity even we even do that with the Music Creation so if Conor's writing a verse and the flow is the same for too long I'll be like that's not contentable I need you to switch your flow up faster so that there can be a new moment where the Beat Drops and the producer goes yeah like yeah when once we started seeing how well the content was doing for the music I started approaching my my creative process with writing the music thinking about what the content would be and a lot of times the content would come first so I would think you know that whole carrot flute video did so well and then we started thinking what other weird instruments could we use and then we would think of a weird instrument like a xylophone and then we made a xylophone beat oh or one we wanted to do one where the fire alarm goes off mid recording session but he's like wait stay that sounds sick and then they bring out the b-pad and make a song we wrap over a fire alarm yeah yeah so a lot of times we would think of the content first and then make the song was there like a revenue number in mind that you guys need to have in order to make this a full time yeah my my dream was like I want to make ten thousand dollars a month from this I'm like if we can make ten thousand dollars a month I'll be like the happiest person in the world and I don't know if I don't know if you guys know how it works but it's roughly there's a lot of variables but on average a million streams is around four thousand dollars USD on Spotify on Spotify and we're averaging like 60 million streams a month right now things are just pretty crazy and I don't think most people know that there's that potential because in music you hear there's no money in streaming but I'm like that's because labels own 80 of your songs but if you own your songs there's a ton of money in streaming and I kind of want to just bring awareness to that yeah well what was like the all right so you guys were just doing your thing and then there was that that pop moment what was the first month of sales on the pop like when it when it when the when the first video really worked out there's a three month delay in accounting so whatever you get from like January February March you get it in April and I remember that pop moment got us our first six figure month yeah and we lost our minds what were you making per month before that like uh was it like kind of under 10 that under a thousand dollars to over a hundred thousand yeah yeah no that Globe series really like if I showed you the chart of my Spotify for artists you see my daily streams were here and then it just explodes like way up what's really cool is that a lot of people have a big moment and then they slow down they get comfortable but the second we had that big moment I'm like we're pulling all-nighters we're going harder than we've ever gone so you can see the chart it goes up and it stays up which is like the beauty of it because we didn't stop like I literally remember our baby was sleeping he was four months old during the globe series and we would take turns pulling all-nighters Connor would be editing the videos go in give them a bottle keep editing it was crazy we were on crack I don't think we would I don't know how we did it but last night when I was watching all the videos I thought Connor is a genius and then now I realize that Brianna's a genius actually and um and actually Connor you could just a little bit of drink of water I just have a thousand questions for this is so uh amazing so you really did Christianity I'm curious just for relationship point of view uh when did uh how did y'all meet when did you meet and like at the time was it like I'm gonna be a rapper and you're like you got it honey go for it no we were 10 and 11 years old we lived in the same apartment complex um yeah when I was telling you earlier when I did that movie Cinderella Man that so the the first time I went to LA for that Premiere uh after that I started staying in La for a few months every year for auditions and stuff like that and we would stay at this this apartment complex called the oakwoods apartment um which was kind of Infamous for having like a lot of child actors stay there and Brianna's little sister Chloe used to act and so her family and my family lived at that apartment complex at the same time and I was 10 and she was 11 and that's that's when we first met yeah and we stayed friends we swapped aim addresses and and then like it's just a cool story because you were supporting him I imagine I I don't know what the life of an actor is like but you're yeah you you were you were supporting him and then you know now you guys are a team I mean that's just like it's like flip-flopped because his acting was much more lucrative than you think like when we first got married he was on a series called X company he did three seasons of that and he was a lead on that and it does pay quite well I don't know if I'm like contractually even allowed to say so I won't but at the time he was more supporting me and then I uh was working and I did I was a nanny at the time so I wasn't like bringing in like huge amounts of money and then I did the pet company stuff and during that time he wasn't working so then I was supporting him yeah and now we've come to this like even ground we're working together and supporting each other and our family my sister my brother-in-law my little brother everyone quit their jobs and they're all working on our team so it really just is a family operation we go to coffee shops every day they help us edit they help us like manage the house they're watching our baby right now so we could do this my brother-in-law Christian mixes and Masters all the music he produces a lot of it that whole carrot flute he played that on the recorder um so yeah we we keep it all in the family we all SWAP who supports who and I knew I'm like one day there's going to be a point where we can all just support each other with this like big thing but I don't know what's going to be I wasn't expecting it to be Connor rapping music we had a guy on the Pod a long time ago you might know him his name's Mike Brown and it's one of the earlier episodes and I forgot what he was doing exactly it was some like mineral oil exploration thing so he would go he would basically knock on people's houses and be like hey did you know there's like some minerals under the ground that you live in um and if you sign this paper that says like cool um you have the rights to like get that get those minerals out dig those minerals out or whatever mine them um you can get paid this amount of money today up front you can get this amount of money today and if you got like if there's a hundred houses he needed all 100 to sign and if he got that then he could sell that that bundle of of letters saying yep you have the rights to a company that actually does the mining he was making millions of dollars doing this in Texas and um he was like yeah I was doing this and I was like that doesn't sound like it takes a lot of people he's like no it's just me and then my he's like I brought on my two brothers and I was like oh what's that like working with family because like you know you hear different things this is before I started a business with my wife I was like you know what's that like and he's like he just looked at me like I was stupid and he was like what do you mean so it's the best and I go oh I mean like I guess you guys get along or works out he's like no of course you know it's not all perfect but he's like my theory of life is you find the people that you love and then you do life with them and that just like has been ringing in my ears for like three years now it's like find people you love and then do life with them to find excuses to do things with them whether it's work vacation or learning something together or joining us you know learning a sport together whatever it is um would you say that's accurate for for you guys or do you guys have anything that maybe will ring in my ears for another three years about this I'd say I'd say it's accurate but there definitely are like we have to plan date nights or else we will never spend time together as a married couple we turn into just business partners for a while and that's it or like for example we'll get in an argument as married couples do but then we have a podcast interview the next morning or a video to shoot so we have to put aside our pride of like who's right or wrong to make the work come first for my siblings if they get in a fight I just have this talk with them last week I'm like you guys are messing up my ecosystem we have like a family ecosystem right now if you fight with you then now Conor can't mix his music with him and then if he's so everyone just freaking get along so sometimes I have to like yeah person that's like stop fighting because business yeah literally and then I'm like there's a point where we're gonna sell everything make a ton of money and then we can all live on a farm and fight all we want but for now freaking get along I can find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better and you just did a so like the way that this is transferring to like actual wealth and money and everything is the Spotify you get paid off that I don't know if you can get paid off Tick Tock or not but you just did a tour as well so you you and Hoodie Allen did like a I think what did you say two or three weeks it was three weeks in Europe yeah I was opening for him actually wrote down our revenue streams just because I didn't want to forget I'd say the time go for it yeah yeah it's like Sam's gonna ask about revenue streams I'd better be prepped we have streaming is the number one by far we have YouTube Money YouTube actually pays quite well in in regards to social media platforms YouTube is like the platform yeah I'll just say this really quick because this is kind of cool so I found out that in them so I I was pretty late to YouTube shorts I watched a Mr Beast podcast where he was talking about you know YouTube shorts being the future I was like all right let me just try this and what I did was I took all my popular tick tocks and because I edit them I have them all my computer saved and I just repurposed them on shorts and you know without the tick tock Watermark or anything I took the original you know and just reposted and YouTube emailed us and they're like you were the most subscribed to artist in November yeah and all artists in the month of November yeah they set up did you just reply damn right send I said is there like a plaque for that or something yeah so I got 800 000 subscribers in one month just just from posting every day for a full month all my popular videos including stuff I heard something funny by the way I don't know if this is true or not might be a conspiracy theory but somebody was saying like uh obviously this part was I think showed to be true which is if you just re-upload your tick tocks with the watermark uh like Instagram and YouTube I think were de-prioritizing I don't like it but yeah so the original file is good but actually they also scrape the metadata the name the file name I don't know if you guys are is this true or are you guys aware of this if if you have the same like MP4 file name underneath they also are trying to match that to just see like oh I don't know if that's true or not it could it could be possible like that Globe video we didn't change anything which is kind of weird that they both they both have exactly 72 million views on both platforms and I I posted them months apart because like I said I was late to shorts um so now because of YouTube that's an extra five figure so yeah that's why I brought that up was that which one grows faster YouTube shorts or Tick Tock what do you where do you which horse do you see winning it's tough because the tick tock algorithm changes so much but I think right now we're more excited about YouTube because YouTube lets you pin a comment and a link to stream the song but Tick Tock doesn't They removed the pinned comment feature so it's harder to convert Tick Tock views to streams right now I had a call with Tick Tock and I said bring that back so hopefully they bring it back and even more interestingly enough on Tick Tock there so maybe my manager too right this is amazing YouTube is much more Creator friendly uh as far as you know when you want to promote something like that that video um the first little video that I post on YouTube I was able to make the pin comment the streaming link for the song yeah and that comment has like 40 thousand upvotes and so it definitely allow people to get to the streaming way easier than tick tock tick tock at this point too even if you try to write the word Lincoln bio or even Spotify they'll hide the comment and we've tested this I've written that I've posted that comment under my own video logged into a different account to go there and the comment's gone and so they don't want to encourage anybody off the app obviously so business but finish this out yeah so it's Spotify it's YouTube then brand deals so uh recently like the last couple you can negotiate like six figures High six figures depending on the ask I'm sure we could get even higher but like in our current state current followers it's like six figure deals sinks which is like getting your songs and commercials or TV video games video games all that stuff um publishing um can you explain publishing real quick in like two sentences oh it's hard to explain two sentences but yeah pretty much like a song has two parts to it there's like the master which is um um also called the sound recording which is what the uh streams are yeah what the streaming royalties are and then there's the publishing side which is like the writers the songwriters um and so the publishing um you get paid for like performance rights so if it gets played on the radio if someone wants to cover your song and use your lyrics so so it's sort of like a different part of the pie that's so Pub and then merch and then live shows so those are like our one two three four five six like seven streams of Revenue and people don't know this like are you negotiating all this are you I mean that's very impressive if you're the one also doing the the publishing stuff and commercials and things like that I mean I was up until like three months ago for the sinks I still am like if he needs to get his stuff in a TV show or movie or a game I'm still doing that but for brand deals we brought on a brand agent team because I just don't have the bandwidth I was like losing my mind because being a mom comes first and if Jude is sick or having a tough day and things are due I'm like I need someone else to take this so we do have a brand agent negotiating the brand deals um but everything else is us and so you um you have these uh revenue streams most of the time I've heard that touring is like number one for a lot of artists you put it at the bottom we were just talking about this on a walk last night I'm like how are we going to talk about touring because it's just not I don't like to speak confidently on anything we've never done ourselves yeah um of course if you're at like Drake Taylor Swift level blah blah you're bringing in hundreds and millions of dollars but just for context we opened on the European tour and I had a chart of the money I'm pretty sure we just broke even on that one just because you have to like rent a bus you have to pay a tour manager you have to pay for everyone to travel your DJ merch think about that because it's obviously a lot of effort you got a little baby at home yeah um you could you probably reduce your output on Tick Tock because you're touring because it takes up so much time you break it even but there's the fan love and you're like okay this means something and like that matters um and you know I think most artists just give you the politically correctly oh I do everything for my fans and blah blah blah but like there's a reality there's trade-offs to everything me and Sam experience this in a super small level with the podcast where we did a couple live shows they're fun but they're a lot of work you don't make any money off of it and it's kind of like well that was just one episode like we could have just done so much more in that same amount of time so we kind of and we both Sam doesn't like to travel and I got little babies at home so I'm not I'm not looking to travel either so we kind of don't do it that much how do you guys measure that uh think about that trade-off of like the live Fan Experience which is create super fans but you lose all this other stuff we found a really good medium for this we met in the middle Conor's booking agent I totally forgot to mention her earlier which is ridiculous because she's iconic uh Connor's booking agent her name is Kara Lewis she also reps like Eminem and a bunch of other really awesome artists um and I've talked to other white rappers she likes yeah oh my God yeah young gravy she's got it she had Travis Scott at one point she's got ice spice right now she's she's literally the best there's an article about her like and it's called like the most terrifying woman in music I'm like I want that to be me like that's me next anyways so we've come to a conclusion with her that right now while Jude is in these early stages of life and we're really just trying to build build build we'll do pop-up shows so for example we're doing a pop-up show in Chicago in November and then we're going to do a pop-up show in Toronto his hometown a few days later and then he'll accept like festivals like uh like a month ago he went to Calgary for a rodeo and he did a festival where they offer you a certain amount of money and you play for 45 minutes I'm like easy right he's gone for two nights so we're gonna do that and then just keep doing pop-up shows to have fan love and like connect with the audience because it is really magical to hear people sing his songs back to him in person yeah but the tick tock experience is good too though because the thing about digital stuff is well I see it and even though I see a hundred thousand likes or tens of millions of views on it I'm like I I don't know who else knows this and then I saw the video of you in Europe and you do really cool tick tocks of you like before the show and then during the show and I'm like holy this guy this is a movement you know this is actually uh it's it's sort of like when Casper and all these companies that like when digital companies start advertising and buying Billboards in the uh Subways and like that you're like oh it's actually adds value to see it in real life as opposed to just on my phone even as a digital viewer you know what I mean totally that's a great person yeah yeah so for us right now shows aren't like live shows like a festival is a money thing it is a revenue stream because he gets paid for like 45 minutes but the concept of touring for us it wouldn't be lucrative enough at this stage for us to invest the time energy funds blah blah blah into it but when he does do shows it's purely fans I know a lot of artists will like charge for VIP meet and greets I'm like why am I charging a fan to say hi to you they're the reason we have a career no like he'll stand outside and talk to absolutely everybody there for free he'll go to the merch table sign merch the venues will try and even like fee us for that they're like if he's at the merch table there's gonna be a fee like that's so silly but anyways when we do do live shows it's going to be completely just for the fans and not a revenue stream how big of a venue can you sell out right now you think we've honestly never tested that because we've never done a headlining solo show but I'll get back to you in a few weeks when we guess you can guess our our hope is somewhere between 900 and a thousand those are like dude well hey you know it's like the thing so I mean technically you like who knows you could sell out a 5000 venue like you never know but in the touring world you have to like build a proof of purchase first so like you can't just go from zero to booking a massive venue you have to start at this venue and then your booking agent can negotiate this venue and then this because you have to like show them hey he sold X many tickets here so now your Venue should take him because you have to negotiate with like the the promoters and the club Owners and so it's hard to say like touring is a tough topic because one we're not versed in it enough and two it's too complicated of a business to be like I can go from here to here you have to build it's not as much like Tick Tock where we can go viral overnight and your life changes yeah that's true sorry if that's a lame answer but it's just so Mike Posner went to my high school at my college when I was there and we were all like this is a guy in the other building that's trying to become a rapper like what is he talking about and um that he did so that was kind of amazing um and one of the things he did when he kind of came back so he like had his high like the traditional way and then he kind of hit a low or like he wasn't making hits anymore like his first album was like whatever big and then like he kind of dipped a little bit and then he like reinvented himself and he's like I'm gonna walk across America so he started doing things that I thought were interesting because he added new layers to him New Dimensions new content kind of like ideas he wasn't doing it for that reason but it worked well also and that he would do these pop-up shows just in a park or he would just be like I'm just gonna start playing in this park and see what happens but like like it kind of didn't matter what happened live like some people got a magical experience that came or were there most people weren't there but he's like what does it matter if like okay let's say there's 50 people here that are having like a 100 out of 10 experience because like something over the top cool just happened and okay I don't have 900 other people here but this video looks so interesting and it makes me more interesting than the how a traditional artist does it so the content would always pop off and his brand would be kind of like the people's champion in a way that he would just do these free shows in the park rather than um rather than like how you know an artist would just do things so I think you know there's something to flipping touring on its head and be like I am going to do these fan things on my own terms but I'm actually going to do them optimized for content and not filling venues because content's my game anyways and if I just keep building that mountain right that's what Mr Beast does he's like if I just like building this mountain like everything in this business it's like what's your goal like if your goal is to be a mega Superstar and perform in arenas then yeah sign with a label and do those things and dedicate your life to building your touring resume so you can get there but that's just not our goal at least right now so we're just focusing on making as much music as possible because I forgot who said I think it was this artist named Mike Stud he compared songs to real estate he's like if you can buy a piece of real estate every two weeks why wouldn't you some of them will remain Shacks on the beach but some of them will be mansions in Laguna so that's our mindset right now I'm like we're investing in as much real estate what is your goal what's like your what's like do you guys have like a like do you want to do this for 30 years are you trying to you just get super rich I mean what's like what do you write on the Whiteboard or in the fridge business business like he loves the art and we love to make good music but ultimately the goal would be to scale this like we would scale a business and then uh potentially sell the catalog someday because it can be evaluated similar to a what number what number excites you 50 million at what age three or four years from now yeah okay I'll be your advisor no charge just add a zero to that number okay because that you're like you guys uh 50 is you guys you're already fingertips away Sean how's 100 million no no that is 500 is the number what did what did Bruce Springsteen get dude I think Bruce Springsteen got 300. you know I want to say something here that's a little bit so I've definitely uh this is probably the most I've ever like you know complimented any guest on this podcast before usually even if I like them I you know I'm hard to get a little bit uh Sam's usually just like Sam's usually fangirls pretty easily he's like he's like so you're hot and I just love people that are hot and like you know you're fit so like you know you're awesome and uh you know I usually keep it you know a little close to the best but but you guys are you're the you're the creative version of hot and I think that's amazing and you're hot thank you yeah yeah we'll take the physical as well the thing that I would say that's kind of an insult is when I watched you on YouTube I didn't have the same fun as I did on Tick Tock so like I watched the full songs and I was like these are good songs but I didn't like you know I wasn't like hooked and I wasn't um like I wasn't as like I felt like the things you guys are doing on Tick Tock I've kind of never really seen before it felt so original and uh it almost felt like a different thing than like music which is like a thing I understand and there's a bunch of like pre-established music options that I can go to I'm curious do you guys feel this uh hey do you feel the same way and B like is there any part of your ego that's like no I like I want to be a traditional take me serious rapper versus like no this kind of like these Tick Tock quick hooks almost like half songs that's my thing and I'm actually creating a new Lane over here how do you think about it the goals are different on those platforms on Tick Tock our goal is to reach new listeners and YouTube is more to nurture the listeners we already have and to nurture the platform because it does pay well so more views on YouTube is more money in our pocket from the AdSense and stuff like that but yeah with YouTube we're not approaching those long form videos with the goal of reaching new people if that makes sense it's kind of hard to explain and then also sometimes if the videos are a bit more polished like for example he did a song with baby no money and that was a very polished music video but like that's like baby's team right they were like all right if we're gonna do a song with Connor Connor's got to jump into our world and do a music video I'm like great then you gotta jump into our world and do a skit so yeah well the thing about your skits is like first of all like I I see a tick tock video and then I listen to you guys when I work out like I I associate it it goes video first then I listen to a while I'm exercising that's her goal but I um when I see the video like you do this you have this amazing thing where you basically you're clearly an actor you have three characters you have the producer then you have you the rapper and then you've got your nerdy brother or cousin or whoever you're supposed to be the guy yeah like the guy who wears the turtleneck and I get to know the characters and you do such a good job I was telling Sean I was like I forget you forget that it's it's Connor you do even obviously it's you don't dress up or anything just the same person you do such a good job that I'm getting to know the characters it's very much like yeah the Doctor Doolittle or whoever it was you know Tyler Perry where they played the it's the same actor doing multiple characters but you're not even dressed up I get to know the characters and I like see the the weird brother come in and I'm like oh he's about to do something funny um and I get to know the the personality of the producer uh version of you it's so good you do such a good job of like adding characters that when I listen to the songs I am like I'm remembering that video and that's what makes me like it for us if it was just the songs they are good but I the the the skits add so much meaning to it I'm like oh this is the carrot one you know what I mean it's so cool um and the funny thing is so like like music like if you listen to an album they they've always done these like skit type things and I'm like back when I used to have CDs like Kanye's you know uh College Dropout album there would be these little skits but they weren't that good and like they they weren't that funny they were kind of long and like um so that concept's been around how did you guys come up with this idea to have these character how did you come up with the idea for the characters uh like what what was the inspo behind that the characters was really just like we don't have anyone else like we're really like we don't really hang out with many people uh we couldn't think of anyone who could play these characters as well so I'm like kind of just freaking put on glasses and just be yeah it was just it really was just the most efficient way to do it and I I had control over the whole process because I was I film it all myself I set up my iPhone filmed them late at night when the bait it's like well you can't coordinate that with other people like hey can you can you come over at 11 PM for a tick tock like No One's Gonna Do That like you have this other video uh I forget I don't even know who the rappers are like eventually I figure out oh this that's pretty Allen but in the video I'm just like oh it's a the skit is like it's a late night thing the janitor has to fill in yeah and I just know the actor as the janitor not even the rapper then you see him rapping and I'm like happy it's really good this is like really creative stuff we would love to our Dream would be to like um almost make a not a parody but of like the office but call it the studio where we can kind of extend these characters a bit more and like go a bit deeper into them and maybe bring on a few like if we have a episode of the studio where Conor's all these characters and then the guest is like Idris Elba comes in and he acts on it and then we get Courtney Cox to come in on the next episode and we use these connections Conor has from acting to now Elevate his Tick Tock skits yeah that'd be fun and then I have another dream of like pitching Spin The Globe to Netflix I'm like how cool would that be if it's a 45 minute episode of Conor spinning the globe lands on a country then he actually flies there and we meet the artist and we see their culture and we see the music scene there like for example Zambia we have to go there because it would blow your mind he couldn't send us his video because he only had 12 hours of electricity allotted like per day and he said until we get a heavy rain the government will not increase our electricity so I can't send you my video clips so we were waiting to post this episode because you don't have electricity in Zambia to send these videos so I'm like I want to go there and see this and like bring awareness to it and I think that'd be so cool because you have food shows on Netflix you have like Zac Efron changing the world everybody feeds Phil everybody or somebody if you fail yeah I'm like Connor should go there and do that but for music I think that'd be so sick well you there's a few there's a few like paths here I think and there's a few examples one example which I'm not relating it as an insult but Weird Al Yankovic like I bet you I don't know this for sure but I would bet you that Weird Al probably out earned most every artist from the 90s I bet you he crushed it in terms of obviously it was in the CD era where it was 22 for a CD that costs 50 cents to make but I bet you Weird Al crushed it and then the other guy and again I'm not saying it's just because he's another white rapper but Little Dicky you know he's got that awesome show Dave he's done a really good job of parlaying this thing into more than just music and rapping but I wish Dave did though which I was so disappointed in the songs on the track were so good and he's just now releasing them I'm like those songs should have been out because so not only are you making money from your show but you're also making money because your Spotify is about to go up so that's another thing if we were to spin the globe all the songs would be out you watch the episode and then you can instantly stream it yeah yeah that's another part of our rollout is is we we don't promote the song Until It's out some people promote the song months in advance they do pre-save campaign stuff like that what were you gonna say about that Sam well what I was going to say was you we are Al and Dave are like uh I actually think Weird Al is even more talented than Dave but they're both like this like cutesy type of thing I actually don't view you that way I view you as like significantly more serious like you like you're not like I I'm laughing with you never at you whereas with Dave it's usually at you know what I mean but he's still done a really good job of taking these over-the-top music videos and turning them into a thing but uh I actually think that you have more potential than him for sure because uh with you you're relatable but at the same time aspirational and like you're still serious but at the same time funny I don't know I just it's such a nice compliment but it's so hard to respond to because that this is that's just hard to respond to I don't know what else to word it but we like Dave and he's like little dickies so good and I just think I just admire you guys I just I think that you Bri like you're you're gonna you're just you you both have the it factor and it's so evident and I think the reason Sean said add a zero to it was because we don't know anything about music but we've hung out with a whole bunch of rich people a lot of billionaires and and like you see like some patterns and certain things and it's like oh well this is yeah like we don't know how big this is gonna be it's already big but it's going to be significantly larger than the way it is now if you have a little bit longer of a Time Horizon and just keep like doing pretty good how long does it take you to create to create a video or a video with a song so what is the creative timeline for for you know one of these that you make it could be like I'm looking for songs made or the song isn't made yet yeah I guess either way or like for example this uh the top video right now on your Tick Tock is this collab the Branded collab that you did um yes with ruffles and KFC um so you did that I assume you basically had to you made something specific for that it wasn't something you already had made right correct um so how long does a process like that take you when you're going to create something from scratch or is it just some days it's one day some days it's three months it's hard to say like do you have a kind of a consistent formula for creation first song some days I can be three hours and some days it can be weeks because he's stuck on something sure but for videos I'll script something in like 20 30 minutes and then he'll film himself for a few hours and then he'll edit for a few hours yeah on average I'm probably filming for one or two hours and then editing for one to three hours and do they all have to be full songs or do you just do like I make you know three verses and that's for this Tick Tock video but I'm not turning it into a full song Do you ever do that no from now we only will invest time in a tick tock if it can convert to streams or else that's just not uh lucrative for us I have like brain fart but yeah uh for Ruffles they only requested a 30 second demo so for that one specifically he only had to write 30 seconds of a song boom done easy but normally it's a full song needs to be done or we won't post it because Tick Tock doesn't pay you for views yeah but it does indirectly because uh let's say something goes viral now your fan base grows the next video you put out with a song uh you know it's gonna gonna pay totally um you know but if the song is out we can show you the charts it'll get like it's so much different if the song's out yeah but I hear what you're saying but like you know for I I admire people who kind of like uh there's a Temptation anytime you're doing something new uh because new stuff is so unproven there's a tendency and a temptation to like take the energy and the momentum from the new thing but Shift Into The Proven game so for example I did a comparison once of Joe Rogan's podcast which is like an interview talk show type type of thing and I compared it to the top like uh The Tonight Show and I was like okay you know just I forgot who's the host or which show I did but like let's say Jimmy Fallon was the the host of the show and it's basically like if you just compare across every key metric so it's like audience size Joe Blows Joe's podcast blows away Jimmy Fallon and actually has for years and years and years like once Joe got the Spotify deal then it was like it got kind of like legitimized but way before that Joe was making a ton of money on a huge audience like five years before that but people didn't think of it like a business because they just didn't have a headline of 100 million dollars a year to Spotify that to like latch onto so audience size Joe is bigger uh production it's Joe's podcast I think it's Joe Jamie and like maybe one other person it's like three or four people total to pull off that show The Tonight Show has like 50 people behind the scenes just to like run one show um like episodes per year he has like more output with fewer people bigger reach and the only thing that was missing was like it wasn't didn't have like a category that it fit into really it was like it's a podcast okay podcast like is that a business I don't really know like it seems like there's a bunch of those uh but Joe stuck with it and like he had a lot of offers to do other things but he just stuck with it let it build build build so that then by the time you know it got really really big he could promote whether it's his own product like on it or some other you know athletic greens or whatever some product that pays him and start making ludicrous money and Mr Beast kind of does the same thing where like he flirts with this idea of like I could go create a Netflix show but the reality is if you talk to him and you've seen him do what he's been doing over the last few years it's just like build audience build audience through this like what he's like why would I leave YouTube I can reach more people than the Super Bowl and you're like yeah but it's different but he's kind of not wrong like he he is right it seemed like this frivolous thing and then now people see Mr Beast as like kind of a business entrepreneur guy but like it's because of like it's because he committed to this new Lane like many years ago and I guess what I would say for you guys is it seems like you guys have a new Lane of this kind of like what I'm it's almost like Fast fashion but for music which is like these tick tocks that are hooky and and catchy and skit based and like they can get millions of views and build you a huge fan base um and it I actually think if you just stay with that and you don't try to be a traditional musician you're going to end up way bigger than all the traditional musicians it's the problem is it's just like a little bit unproven where that goes exactly or like and it's very tempting to like take offers from legitimate Brands and and legitimate like paths that you've heard of but the good news is you're you're making millions of dollars along the way you're making millions now so at least it's at least you ain't broke and we've talked to every major label it's it's not like I our friend Nick said that he's like we're Independent by choice not by default because you'll see in the comments like why hasn't anyone signed this kid yet someone signed Connor and I'm like they've tried we will not because that's not our goal our goal is to like do this ourselves do things the way we want to do it and honestly like prove to other people that you can do it um because I had no idea that this was possible and I'd love for other people that are making music to know it too how old are you guys I'm 29 and Connor's 28. wow and early on I remember you had this cool video with Courtney Cox and then you had another one with uh what's his name yeah those are cool have you had any other uh like heroes or celebrities reach out that you that floored you um there's one guy I really look up to his name is Russ he he's uh yeah he's a huge independent artist he really kind of wrote The Blueprint that I followed as well I want to talk to into someone about independent touring it would be Rusk because I know Russ does it and he sells out massive like if you want to talk about the financial part the business part of touring he'd be the one to talk to his his song Civil War gets me pumped up great son yeah he's he's amazing but yeah Russ rust reached out yeah so he like dm'd and showed love which was just really cool because he's sort of been my North Star as far as just like how to do this independent he wrote like unsolicited advice stay independent you'll be making M's like clockwork and I'm like that's all I needed to hear I think things are us that was that was really cool one for me he only talks in raps too that's amazing uh because his DMS it's so hard because that the the DMS are so like um simu reached out yeah yeah yeah he he's amazing um I yeah I can't I'm like you know when people ask you a question on the spot and you're like name a song and you're like uh I don't know any songs yeah there'll be random things where like I'll notice on Tick Tock like oh Logan Paul liked the video or T-Pain liked the video like you know there'll be little things like that that's cool but as far as like directly talking to someone the the big one that comes to mind is is Russ just because he's someone who I'm trying to emulate as far as the business goes I know you're in Vegas is it translating into off the screen stuff you know are you walking around uh downtown Vegas and people are coming up to you has has that been happening that's been the weirdest part because like I said we stay in our bubble and we hadn't been leaving the house much especially during kelvid and then we went on a trip to Salt Lake City because we love Utah it's so random but we went there and it was a ton and especially at the airport like the TSA agents are always like oh my God wait they'll like look at his ID and then be like the music guy like we love your stuff and I'm like that's crazy but the best is when little kids come up and they have their little are you a YouTuber and they're so cute and it's like hey yeah what's up and we had like a five-year-old Super Fan come to Calgary to meet him at the rodeo and Connor took him to Tim Hortons for donuts um but yeah that that's that's really cool because you get to see it translate in real life and especially when it's kids and you're like oh that could have been like a core memory for that kid that's really cool yeah now that you are winning in one lane what I found is that when people are are let's say winning and let's say that right now you're winning in like this content music game um you'll often see it's like kind of like Neo in The Matrix you sort of see the game a little differently you sort of see opportunities that you know like oh I feel like other people could be doing this in this other lane or we could do this but you know you know we think that would work but you know we just have our hands full so we're not going to do it but like do you have you seen any what I call adjacent opportunities for either content creators or on the business side like have you you've come from a business brain right so like do you see other opportunities this guy Kevin he has this account on Instagram called icon brick and he makes Lego animations and I've seen a couple big rappers and labels hire him to make Lego animations for their songs long story short he's an incredible songwriter and I was telling him the other day dude put out your own music and use this platform You're Building to promote your own music like yeah every like 10 to 12 videos you're doing like other rappers but then slide in one of your own videos in there with your song wow this is sick I'm watching one of these videos now oh they're incredible we're actually really we're releasing a song with him in a couple he only has 127 000 followers you're buying early on this guy this yeah dude he's in he's insane I'm like that's a double Revenue stream you'll be making money from label is paying you to make Lego animations of their songs meanwhile you'll be pocketing Spotify revenue for your own songs so that's like a perfect example um that just won't happen that one happened recently so I can think of it I can't think of any others that are super recent you know what's crazy is with Tick Tock like it's just crazy how sound bites are becoming songs so you know like there's that one on Tick Tock where it's that lady going uh I want to thank my man thank you for my man I saw that the other day it was just a so she said that like yeah she she just said that at a uh at a award show and that turned into a clip and then yeah it was just it was her saying it and I don't know if she did it or someone else turned it into a thing and then there's this other one where there's this guy he's got a 30 second video um uh Rick talks about his uh his boo thing uh but it it it's literally a 30 second clip of him rapping and I'm Googling for this guy and he's got it has a million likes on Instagram on reels and I'm Googling I'm like I want to see the whole song it's not even a song There Is No whole song it is just like his 30 second clip and it's it's pretty amazing how uh like things are happening with music where like it's just like a clip of a thing it's not even real I guess the best example of that is the corn kit remember that kid that I was like I love corn and it became this Viral Song on Tick Tock for like six months yeah it's amazing but that's actually something we've clocked and we've wanted to be uh careful of because sometimes people have their song go viral the sound but people don't connect that sound to the artist yeah so there were a couple like viral sounds if you asked me who the artist was I'd have no idea so I was like we need to be very cognizant of that and like make sure that we attach you to the songs as much as possible which is why we're so like long form skit focused rather than like let's make a sound pop off because it's great it could be like a moment and a spike for a song but long term the goal is to attach Connor to his music more do you uh on your way up like kind of like when you were moving boxes at the alpha Paul warehouse and you're you know in between acting gigs you maybe trying to make it in the music game and it's it's not obvious you're like now you're winning and winning feels great but you probably spent many years losing this is how I felt in the world of Entrepreneurship I yeah from the ages of 21 to 29 I was only doing startups that failed that's like I don't know eight years straight of just getting my ass kicked did you like dread going to family events because we dreaded it because it's just like the hey how are things going how's the little music thing yeah no people would be like what's what's the new one because they're so used to me every year having a news story about the new thing that's gonna be the big thing I was like oh damn you're right there is always a new one uh like I wish just one of these was the one and uh you know like that that was it so was there any I guess like moments you remember from the kind of the bottoms uh that like you know either a decision you made a talk you had with yourself some advice you got that like sticks with you or helped you during that time it was just it was brie it was like you know I I I don't have a bunch of friends which that sounds strange I'm I'm a very social person and I get along with everybody but my my core circle is very small and I spend 90 of my time with Bree whether that's us working together or we go on walks every night and we just talk about stuff and yeah there was definitely a period especially when kova hit and Productions completely halted so I had already a year before that been struggling to get acting work and then now there weren't even auditions and I was definitely at a low point and was like what do I do and um Bree was somebody who very early on I had shown my music to and this was prior to me show like I used to just record at home by myself I didn't show anybody it was just a hobby I had because I loved hip-hop but I was afraid to put it out into the world because I was afraid of the Judgment I would get I even had an alter ego called like he's gonna kill me yeah yeah this is called unidentified unidentified I use like a fake name and I would I would used to upload music on YouTube anonymously just because I wanted to see what people would think about it and I was like that's stupid right uh without like attaching me to it and I was afraid what my friends would think like oh of course like the actor wants to be the rapper now and I was like Frozen with um judgment fear yeah exactly and and Bree has always from the very start just been such like like my my number one supporter and has given me the confidence and so when I was in that low point and and music was something that I was sort of playing with she was like go all in on this trust me try it like try Tick Tock like what's the worst that's gonna happen like nothing's going on anyways you know and so she she was the one that instilled that confidence to like go for it and Ramon instilled that confidence in me yeah I got hired at the pet company as a social media assistant and I met Ramon and then after that like a month later he's like yeah no you're my creative director 100 and anything I ever wanted to start he's like I'd be your first investor I'd be your first investor and he believed in Conor so much so I was taking that confidence from Ramon who was my mentor and I instilled it in him and Ramon told me he was like I'm I'm whatever they're doing I'm in and I'm like you're an idiot man there's no there's no money in music like what's there to invest in there's nothing to invest in and he was like I don't know but whatever there's something here well I'm in you were happy with the Lord he told me I was homeschooled yeah up until high school I went to uh public high school but prior to that I was homeschooled yeah and uh do you think that that like did that help you in any way in terms of what I think so because when I was homeschooled I used to like start businesses I showed Ramon my business card it was like Brianna Peterson it was like violinist pianist vocalist dog walker pet sitter babysitter hire me for anything like I would I just had so much time on my hands and also creatively I would write children's stories I would uh I have old videos from the apartment complex I wanted to be a director so I would go around filming all the kids um like documenting their lives so being homeschool gave me a lot of time on my hands and I think it gave me like a a need for creativity that most kids didn't have because when you're in school you're constantly entertained by other kids but I just had my siblings and I so I had to come up with ways to entertain ourselves so we would remake Spy Kids we would remake Disney movies like we would film them ourselves edit them like so all my family jokes so like you've been doing this since you were like four yeah you've always been making content yeah so no one's asked The Homeschool question before and I never really thought of it till now that I guess homeschooling really did correlate because it like forced me to be creative well the we we have like a large male most of our listeners are men the takeaway here is like get yourself a strong woman to be your partner here I mean like like this is this is like a good this is a really great marriage it seems like you got to get yourself a strong woman to help make this all happen um I'm a huge fan of Alex and Layla hormozzi I think that they're a super power couple you know what they live in Vegas I think so I'm like gonna try and run into them at Milk Bar one night because they never skip dessert whatever they say but they're a huge inspo for the husband and wife business relationship because there's really nothing cooler like we get to work together be parents together well I think most people actually it's horrible you guys make it work because you're you you are both emotionally stable you have similar values it seems you have similar goals I think in most cases it's not awesome I think working with family in most cases is horrible well thank you no I mean and we have our moments I don't want to make it seem like it's always just so so easy because like Bree had kind of alluded to earlier it's really easy to fall into this like we work together with co-workers mentality when every so often it's important to remember that we are husband and wife and we need to find that balance so we're co-workers who kiss what's the big what's the deal exactly yeah no big deal we all do it um do you uh we'll leave it this uh Sam's about to be a dad you guys recently uh had your first baby any uh any advice by the way Sam have you heard there's their song about about their son there's a line in there he's like uh it's like you got my eyes and I got your back I was like oh that's sick yeah that's a good life dude like I remember watching that video and I was getting emotional and and that's why I was like I think you're better than Weird Al and Dicky and all these people I mentioned before is because like I see your stuff and like they don't inspire me I like them you inspire me I won't take any more Little Dicky slander on this podcast for the record uh I feel like you know I let the first one slide the second one you know he's cooler stuff and I'm like oh like Lil Dicky is like oh bro out of this conversation I love him but he like his character of like this neurotic Jewish guy of like always complaining like I I don't think I want to be you or like I want to learn from you in terms of the day-to-day life it's more so your career is amazing and I respect it and I like your music but with Connor like when I saw that song I'm like dude the values that you're talking about the songs like I'm on board with like I've been I'm inspired to live a little bit better I love hearing this from Sam and I'll I know we have to wrap this up but I'll just to jump on this point so many artists have come to us and they're like Connor needs more of a brand I'm like what do you mean like he's not he's too normal like he looks like every other guy on your street blah blah and I'm like I'm pretty sure that's why people really like him because and you're way hotter than me let's be real Sam what's up with you and like hotness oh don't give me wait till we you should show me your calves if you guys that's my one thing why'd you bring it up show him your caps give me six months I'll show them my cat they're like they're just like he's got a private Instagram account for just but we're working on them we're working on the Cavs but um yeah no just that's really cool to hear because the realness has always been something that I've had a gut instinct to stick with so it's cool to like hear that confirmation from you this is the first time uh that um Sean has fangirled out a little bit absolutely it's me Sean it's so nice to finally meet you and thank you thank you for the support and for watching and listening It generally means Sean asked about baby advice yeah number one the number one advice we have is like and it's so cliche but just be so present in those newborn days because they flew by genuinely we look back at old photos like a baby photo of Jude will make me just cry instantly because I'm like I wasn't um I wasn't like oh no I was like I was so focused on business like too much so I wasn't like I would like hold him and wait for him to nap just so I could go work more but I wish at the time I was like enjoying it more so that so that you don't end up crying on a podcast one day here we are no the anytime we get crying we know our views are gonna go up yeah so thank you and don't go on tour for three and a half weeks because it was fun but he missed uh he missed a lot I think you're doing it right I think even if maybe there were some moments where I mean where you maybe think you weren't present I have a feeling just watching you on social media I have a feeling you're doing things wonderfully and the things you've said on the Pod about the family business and everything I I think you get I think you're crushing it in life in business you're crushing it in life you're probably crushing it even harder yeah so thank you and I know what you mean I look at those photos and I I literally don't even remember I'm like I don't remember her looking like this right it's like obviously I remember when I see it but I'm like oh man that just feels like two different times and kids are this funny thing where like for me at least all day I'm like oh my God I can't wait for you to go to sleep or just like we get a moment of free time and then as soon as we have free time that's all me and my wife talk about is it's like okay wait what do we want all this free time for all we're gonna do is talk about the kids anyways um like the funny things that they did today so it's like uh it's this cup that like you know you can never really fill up enough of but at the same time you're like um I don't know it's like this weird dueling thing I don't have like the words or the wisdom to like articulate it but I definitely feel it where it's uh you can never spend it's like an infinite amount of time you could spend but it's really not about the like you know the duration of the time it's kind of like did you kind of sink in and appreciate it versus um just like being there because I've had many days where I spend hours and hours and hours but I didn't really like I didn't really let it sink in uh you know I was kind of passing the hours which is a little bit different so yeah I know which one thing once where it's like as soon as your kid is annoying you put your phone down because if you're present in the moment that kid isn't annoying but if you're trying to multitude you're trying to be something the wines and the that's that's when it becomes annoying so we've done a really good job at like as soon as the babysitter leaves at three like we didn't we're just fully present we're not but when he was a newborn we weren't doing that as much so you're gonna have more um I don't know if I want to go through the whole pregnancy thing again it was really tough on me especially mentally after I'm already a very anxious uh person so I think having a newborn to care for while recovering from giving birth at home um was pretty intense for me I don't know if I would want to do it again but we'll see I know we want to adopt I've been looking at adoption websites I literally lay in bed and like cry looking at them because I just want to adopt all of them but yeah I think we got to see our son we got to see what our DNA would look like combined he's so funny he's he's amazing he's a little Connor um but moving forward I'm like I don't know if I need that urge again I think I would just like to adopt a little Vietnamese baby from where my grandma's from and honor her in that way you got to make sure they can rap too yeah if they can't rap we're not I'll be part of the application I'm like they can't use three syllable words by 12 months they're out yeah if they can't play three different characters in this skit yeah they didn't pass it yeah no we definitely want for a versatile child to adopt yeah we need some head shots well we appreciate you guys coming on you're amazing oh my God we appreciate you guys having us yeah this is an honor thank you I feel inspired talking to you I imagine I imagine Sean does too and uh producer John Jonathan was texting me and he goes I'm loving this they're so damn likable Jonathan that was my biggest fear not being likable because I never really come on camera or do stuff like this but I knew Sam so I was like okay I know Sam I want to do this but normally I'm very fearful of criticism I've always been pushing I think you need to start like like your own personal brand like you're you're so knowledgeable in the music space that like and and you're always behind the scenes No no one knows who you are no one knows how impactful you are and what I do and I think I think you need to start putting yourself out there that's very nice for sure well totally I mean if you look at um their marriage didn't end well so that's not the great example but the Rock's wife uh I forget her name um what is her name Daniela they did yeah but but they still work together they have an interesting Dynamic oh yeah they still work together and she's known as being a pit bull like she is like feared in the industry she's sharp and I think she has more Talent underneath her now but that's like an interesting example other than the divorce thing of of the business going well besides that besides that uh we'll we'll Workshop our uh our next analogy well and people people hate on Kris Jenner but uh in my opinion I love Kris Jenner she seems like she still has a pretty healthy maybe I don't agree with all the tactics but her kids and her have a great relationship and it seems like it's worked really well and everyone's provided for I was interviewing a nanny that nannied for them and I was like I was like I'm probably not gonna hire her but I did like five interviews just to dig for information about what they're like and she was like I think by the third interview she picked up that I only wanted to ask her questions about what it was like there and um and I was like yeah I'm super curious can you just tell me some things and she was like not really and I was like okay I respect you for that that's that's fair uh we like the Kardashians I once made Conor binge watch a whole season with me I did I didn't know how to feel at first and then afterwards I'm like oh they're all just Killers they're all killers yeah like and you know you don't have to agree with all the stuff they've done to do famous but they seem like they have a great room yeah they all stick together the Loyalty of that family seems strong um well thank you all for doing this this is awesome thanks for having us thank you so much everybody go Tick Tock is that the first place you want people to follow you sure yeah I mean just um well honestly I think my Instagram is safest I was gonna say streaming services just like going to your favorite streaming service type in my name all of it type in my name Connor price you'll see all my songs there yeah uh but yeah Tick Tock Instagram oh you know what can I plug one thing sure any streamers or video Gamers uh creators watching this all of Connor's music is dmca safe so you can put it in your videos without copyrights yeah I created a playlist on Spotify uh under my channel that's called like dmca safe copyright free words all of my songs that are copyright free because I have a few songs that I did with other artists and they have their labels get involved so you can't use them but I have a list of all of the songs that you could use on your YouTube videos your intros for your podcast whatever you want unlimited use um because I don't do YouTube ID I think the long-term value of having creators use your music is way more than like trying to get a few dollars every month because somebody use your song in a vlog so yeah if you're a Creator and you are looking for copyright free music I have a bunch of that that I want people to use and Bree you're on Twitter but you don't have any follower or you're like do I have a Twitter I don't even know oh I found it I was gonna say you should promote that because I bet a lot of people are going to want to DM you oh I signed up on threads I have threads okay hit her up on threads but friends doesn't have DMS you're gonna get a lot of opportunities from this you you just got the Brianna price handle honest I got my Brianna price handle on Instagram so yeah just search her up on Instagram because yeah someday I want to and I just got this Instagram handle I've been dying to get it's called home studio because I want to start a a newsletter for Independent Artists and then eventually I saw your newsletter it's really horribly named by the way you need to change that name no I stopped that the independent one yes I stopped it that's done the idea was good thank you spelling was the worst I know I got it that's done don't worry so I'm switching I want to do home studio because I want to build a newsletter for Independent Artists and then also then turn that into a potential we sell like home studio kits where everyone's like what mic do you use I'm like just buy Connor's kit it comes with the mic headphone interface smart everything you can use to make money from home and I'll record all my songs using that kit so it sells itself amazing uh you guys are awesome thanks for coming on I have a feeling that the next time you guys come on you'll be 10 times bigger because you have the talent for it and I think you've stumbled into something really really amazing and I think if you just keep going it's gonna it's gonna get really big so thanks for coming on and thank you that's the episode that's the pod that's the Pod thank you thank you

I used to use the guilt from drinking to make me feel motivated about training so I'd be like oh yeah I could drink Pinot Noir cup you know bottle two bottle three bottles no problem eat dinner go to sleep wake up 5 a.m train like an animal what's the problem no problem there's a problem I don't see a problem you could train hungover oh yeah like an animal [Music] yeah man we're live we just we get things going and I can kind of fill you in um you probably don't know anything about who we are do you no but that's not unusual I I don't know much about anything really good hey same I mean I I've I've learned about you I mean I I I've uh this podcast is called my first million so basically I owned um a fairly successful and big Media company that I sold and one of our products was this uh podcast and it's listened to by millions of people a month and it's mostly a business podcast which I'm like a I'm a health nut and a health nerd I was a former College athlete so I'm going to talk to you all about like uh layered superfood and some of your businesses and stuff like that that's where we're gonna spend most of the time but the reason why I wanted to have you on was because we have people we normally don't have guests normally it's my co-host Sean who's not here and someone was asking us like who's your dream guest and I was like man Laird Hamilton that's who I want and they're like why and I was like he I had my description as to why I liked you best but you said it in another interview a while back you said something like your life is like a wheel and like business is one spoke health is another spoke uh relationships is another one and like there's all these Spokes and like they all have to be nice in order to make this whole wheel work and I was like oh man that's describes best why I like you because you know I like making money I like being fit I like having a lovely lovely relationship with my wife I like doing all this stuff and so uh I'm pumped to talk to you this is uh I'm normally never nervous to talk to anyone but you're like when the first maybe you're you and Andrew huberman made me nervous to talk to because like I like I admire you guys and I look up to you guys well I appreciate that I'm I'm thankful for that I was talking to some friends telling them how I'm pumped that you're coming on and most people know who you are but then for the people who don't I was I was like well you know he's done a lot of things so I don't even know how to describe you that I was like he started as like a surfer and then like a big wave surfer then did some modeling and I always tell my friends I'm like he's a hunk you probably recognize his face he's he's a hunk his face is all like you because you're you you like represented this quintessential Surfer but then you uh evolved where you and your wife now are quite popular because you guys have this almost zen-like attitude and so a lot of people like like me I I Turn to You just to hear like what's your advice on living you've also started um layered superfood you have another uh Fitness brand what what do you like what would you say is uh like where are you now and how do you kind of describe yourself in a sense or two is to kind of your professional existence I always you know because like because of Hawaii the way we grew up there was a lot of you know there's a there's I would say segregation but I think there's a lot of just a lot of friction because you have all these different cultures and and I so my favorite description is somebody goes well you know like where are you from or something and I go well I'm a human from Earth so I'm a human from Earth and if you're something different than when then we should probably sit down and have an incredible conversation but otherwise let's get past that and then get into like you know what are these other things uh that we do you know and I think it's I think uh none of us are what we do we we are we are who we are and then we do these other things but I do I do like uh I mean listen I'm the water sports and and and fitness and and and health and wellness is you know I've kind of made a a career out of that and so I do like uh I've been fortunate to do that that's been been a been a beautiful thing but I mean I am concerned about uh you know being healthy and and living a healthy lifestyle and you know being a good example for my children being you know having a good relationship I just I just know uh I feel best when I'm when I'm when I have all those things yeah I always knew you I mean I remember watching the doctor uh was it riding Giants um and a few and a few other movies uh with you in it and that's how I knew of you and then I learned about the layered superfood the creamer and I was like oh this is great so I've been a I've been a customer for years but I never would have paid you as like a business guy I remember seeing you maybe it was on some talk shows or something like that where you had this like electric um yeah the golf board that was that was awesome and I'm like well he's just like tinkering and inventing and then I started looking at then I saw uh Larry superfoods go public and I was like and I remember reading the report I was like oh [ __ ] like I think when you went public it was doing like something like 40 million a year in sales and I think it went public at a 400 million dollar market cap but I was like oh man I never would have pictured this guy as like doing this stuff what um what kind of I I know that it was you you were just tinkering with these mixes and a buddy of you a buddy of yours was like all right let's actually do this thing but did you always kind of consider yourself interested in going into business or was that just uh what the hell let's just try it no I mean listed early in my career uh early in my career in surfing I I I just I looked at like you know where the money was like where's the money in surfing and at the at the time it was in the apparel um it was in the apparel business and so I went at kind of uh I would say 18 19 I got exposed to the apparel business went used to work in downtown Los Angeles in a in a in a a sweatshop learning from a Korean guy that came to America with 38 dollars in his pocket and had a 10 million dollar Sweatshop business making denim jeans and kind of learned the whole cut and sew garment business uh and real life you know and and got to exposed to every aspect of it uh you know I think because of the because I didn't ever really participate in the conventional uh aspect you know the tour of Surfing I was always kind of you know kind of Rogue in the sense that I focus on big wave riding I wanted to be a big you know I wanted to kind of I thought that that for me was the that was the thing I was intrigued by that was the thing I was best suited for um there wasn't a lot of ways to there wasn't a platform let's say for me as an athlete it wasn't like you know NBA or NFL or you got this huge platform you go play your wife was was volleyball so like you guys were both like you're both like Giants and and small fields which I I always I'm like dude that's crazy they turned not even just surfing but big wave surfing which is still cool but it's tiny oh yeah volleyball and I'm like I know both of them I knew I knew you both individually yeah when we had one and I think that forced us to be more creative and you know and and do what we had to do I always say subsidize it you know like uh normally you know you subsidize your surfing with maybe some excavation work or something you know you do some other you do another job Surfers go work at restaurants they I mean they do whatever they can so they could be in the ocean like Arnold Schwarzenegger laying bricks exactly exactly so you just do whatever you you do to subsidize your your love but uh and if you can kind of take both of them you know if you can turn your work in you know your or your passion into your work that's a beautiful thing but we've had to be creative I think both Gabby and I have always had to be creative in our career just because we were in such Niche sports that it forced us to be a little bit more entrepreneurial in general we just with our you know it's whether we were you know a she-modeled i model early on I mean I I did some film work I mean I do we do what we had to you know we do what we have to do and then that kind of you know we've had sponsors and I think in in the evolution of an athlete you have a tendency to depending on your brand and and your you know and what you've you know what you've done I think you evolve into wanting to kind of be your own sponsor at the end right get and and and and we've been real selective and I mean it's been I think that that's been a uh it's contributed to our longevity but it's also been something that's encumbered us a little bit because we just won't do you know we won't just endorse and promote any anything for money I just we've been pretty cautious about things that reflect our authenticity things that are real to us and so uh you know and I think that's what led us to a lot of these these you know the situation I mean with lyric superfood especially like I just wouldn't do other you know energy drinks and other stuff that just isn't good for you you got to promote good [ __ ] no exactly and and and and and I and you know and so I and I'm because of my surfing and this and some of the Feats that I've done and the Innovations I've done I have some people that look up to me and so I look at that as a responsibility to conduct myself in a certain way uh I want to do that anyway for my own thing so it's a little selfish in one sense but but it you know but like like again layered superfood or xpt or you know even layered apparel these are things that you know reflect Who I Am the the uh and and you know it's like not every single not every single uh you know everything in lyric superfood is something that that I love I don't make you know I don't want every flavor because I have to make flavors yeah I saw like an interview where someone was like uh so what flavors do you like you know like I drink this one and they're like well I like this one you go I hate that one or something like yeah I don't drink that one I like this one yeah but you have to make stuff for people you know you have to make stuff for everybody right right I mean for me I feel like the more successful the company can be the the more impact I can have and are those the three like major revenue streams which is the superfoods um it's uh xpt xpt and uh uh clothing is that like your three main things yeah I mean I'm always doing other other stuff too I mean I do I do I do speaking stuff um you know we have other sponsors that we work with and so you know those like the media just like that would be like the media category yeah there's meaty there's hair yeah I have a farm uh I have a farming project right now that I'm working working on as well and then and then uh and then there'll be some you know we I work with uh yeah both Gabby and I work with Land Rover um I work with Fremont watches and so I have some there's media and then there's like some other sponsorship endorsement stuff that continues on uh which you know I think I think part of the reason why that stuff continues on at this point in my career is just because first of all our our authenticity and I'm continuing also to pursue um athletic achievements as well so I'm still doing that that stuff uh and so that that kind of so there's you know again there's a lot of um a lot of spokes in the wheel I remember um I saw this interview where you're talking about uh like taking the company public and you're like we got to go there and ring the bell and it was just so much work and all this paperwork and I'm shocked that anyone could do this and at first you guys are flying high things were going well as of late the stock has been crushed do you like what what are those emotions going through like right now when it's gotten crushed and do you regret taking it public because it seems like a good business I mean you're doing good revenues um I think this year the growth um it didn't work out this year I just read one of you guys most recent reports I think you changed CEOs what are the emotions now where things are changing I mean right now it's a tough world for we're not alone I mean so that's kind of nice it'd be like if it was everything was booming and then you were having trouble you might be a little bit like well what are we doing wrong so there's some of that I mean I wouldn't change a a bit of it I mean I I could say listen coming from my background and and my my relationship with like being patient and you know crashing and wrecks and all my like all the stuff that I've gone through hard to I'm gonna be hard to phase you know what I mean like I'm I'm I'm I'm my family's healthy I'm healthy we're we're good you know it's like I tell Gabby I go you know we were good we're good now we're gonna be good like it's all so are you guys having like conversations when you're like did you have a significant amount of your net worth tied up into the company uh I mean hey well it's I mean listen this the stock value alone it was was substantial so it's but again that's counting chickens before they hatch and so and I'm that's not that that's not my world I'm not that's not I'm not that guy like I'm not that that because I realize that life is so temporary that if you think you can somehow and that and that you really don't have the kind of control you think you have everybody I mean so my my my the university I went through the University of you know of big wave riding or the University of the ocean or the University of the Hard Knocks you just have a different perspective so I I've been in you know of course what I love the stock to be going through the ceiling absolutely uh but I wouldn't change going public I I wouldn't go back and redo it because the fact is is that that experience right at the end of the day that experience of going through that process doing the road show doing 90 Zoom one hour zooms over a three week period all day long every day and just all this stuff that we did and and and and just just that knowledge you just can't unless you've been through that no no people can't tell you can't talk to you like they they can say oh yeah what's you know or I know what it's like well no you don't know what it's like unless you've been through that process and and and so you can't really appreciate it and and so for me I feel like that was an incredible School of not and and experience that you know if there's anything you can take with us there's a great friend of ours who's a woman judge in the from the south and she always says to us invest in experiences because if there's anything that you might be able to take from you when you do depart this earth when you die you know it may be that I mean you're not taking anything else so none of this other stuff's coming with you not the value and the money and the car house and all the stuff that none of that stuff's coming with you the only thing that's going to come with you is the possibly could be these experiences that you've gone through and so for me I feel like what an incredible thing and we're we're the C the new CEO we have in there is incredible um this is only it's a little bit like because and I've and I've done some pretty brutal uh endurance things in my career um and and and I and I I know when when you're digging deep and and you know that's where all the that's where all the the building comes from right that's where all the character building and the polishing of the stone happens in when it's when you're you know down and so for me I'm just like been here before probably be here again no problem I mean here we here we go so it's for me I feel like this is this is a little bit more like uh the rough like the I would say the uh refining you know like you're getting refined right now and and so it's only going to help us make everything tighter make our you know what we need to do better because if you're not getting bumped a little if you're not getting pushed then there's no reason you know I go I'll give you an analogy of a like a professional team you know you have this beautiful team that you built and you go and you have an incredible season but then you lose yeah in the finals and then and then the next season they break the team up and they're like well you could have easily won but you just you just you broke it up because you and and the winning and losing it's it's it's I mean the difference is nothing the difference is yeah yeah so so yeah I mean it's I mean my biggest thing is just I I need this business to be successful because the stuff's awesome I need it I need it I need it for my friends I need it for everybody who loves it I like so that's the biggest you know that's our biggest our biggest uh you know for me that's the most important thing is that that we continue to to supply the people that we do and we continue to get new people in there and and you know I think right now everybody's getting squeezed you know I think there's a big squeeze on the whole you know on the whole system so the you know that's I mean this is this is when the this is when the tough guys get going this is when they you know and ours and and our new CEOs and you know 100 Miler he's a merit like he's a long distance Runner so he knows how to he knows how to grind so will you um I read the story about how you used to make this stuff um and you're using turmeric and everything you're just making this making what is now layered super food at home how much capital Did you invest to get it store ready and about how long did that take it was pretty pretty it didn't take I mean we you know the unusual thing about the business was is that I mean it could have been a couple 20 30 grand or something like that at the most and that but we went online first that's why it was really not didn't cost us much to start we made a you know a powdered version of my original recipe and then and then about the third or fourth rendition through that uh we were just in there looking like you're mixing like Coke you just got like you probably just had some scales at home and a little Ziploc bag and then yeah exactly one then yeah and then obviously this is it and then and then and then uh and and my friend that I was working with Paul Hodge was like a startup a really and I had been working with him on the golf board on another project and uh and so you know we and we had what we did we just started online which was fortunate like remember your first years of sales what's that do you remember your first Year's uh sales uh I don't I don't probably I mean I think it happened fairly quick but ah you know 500 Grand or something like that I don't know something pretty quick but it's but it happened real quick it was like you know right away it was like okay 5 10 15 you know it was like we just marched into you know probably 100 100 150 something like that within or even even a little bit more after probably a year I mean if you counted like making samples you know playing with it getting every you know package getting some packages of it going online getting the people that whole process if you get to count that within the year yeah something like that nothing nothing quick but I mean the traction happened quickly because good stuff people put and and I and I was able to tap into kind of a smaller group of you know friends I would say friends and following that that was available to us and that that helped us uh I think it would have been a little different if we were just starting from scratch with no with no uh kind of nobody there to do stuff with and we got a lot of and we got a lot of response too we were we had a real inner uh I would say a a good group that was interactive like they would oh try this one oh we don't like that one you know that was engaged with us that helped us and that was a big piece of it that we had customers that were kind of more engaged with helping us uh kind of refine things I think that was it that was that was also very useful in the in the beginning well you timed it perfectly so like right now we're in the thick of like a health Trend like uh you know partially because like if you go to my Instagram feed it's like you and like all rip dudes like you know they're like in ice bass now which I do and you know it's uh all we're knees over toes like it's like we're in like a it's become cool now to to be healthy and like but you were talking about in um I read how you were like dude we've been using ghee for 20 years ghee is popular now you've been doing a lot of stuff that uh is like considered eccentric 20 years ago which is now not quite normal but it's more normal you also said that um you're like I'm obsessed with ideas and like figuring out what can be uh what's gonna work what's not gonna work were there any other ideas other than some of the than what is now superfood was there any other ideas that you were tinkering with where you're like man I think this this thing that I'm doing on a day-to-day basis or this food I'm consuming or this trend that I'm or this thing that I'm doing now will become more popular and I should maybe pursue that well I mean listen stand up paddling I mean I don't know if anybody knows what stand-up paddling is but I start I mean I I did that for eight years alone like that that thing and that thing was the fastest growing sport in the world for a while like it's it's everywhere in the all in the whole planet I mean as far as a sport itself um as a discipline I mean foiling foiling is another thing that I I was doing like we're the first guys to really stand and and then we're the first guys to ride that you realize that you could ride ride waves with foils and now it's you got foil magazines and there's ten different disciplines and for those people that don't know what a foil is it's an airplane that rides underwater that that is attached to a board above so you're and I know people have seen them you know at this point you've seen some either an electric version or some I mean that's what the electric one yeah America's cups and all the boats have gone that that direction as well I mean most of my stuff has come in sport um I have you know I I mean you always have some funny ideas that that you know that that there's a there's gonna be three customers or maybe four you know I mean xpt is another a big you know a big I mean there's some stuff in xpt I have this pool training system that that I've been working on for a while that has is still hasn't really gained traction uh just be I mean it's gaining traction but again but the breathing part of it I think you have like a breathing part on the app and like I know a lot of people who do that that I mean is what's the app the uh how much does that cost or is it all free um no you there's different pieces of the app there's different stages of it you can go to xptlife.com and then if you want the breathing app you know there's different there's different and I don't know exactly what they're charging for the app that the app right now because we've just came out with a specific breathing one but there's there's a bunch of different uh you know there's different levels of of your participation and we do it we do a camp too we do like a a two and a half day seminar but you know you know what I have I say about Innovation and ideas is uh you know it's just a new application of an old idea I mean you you think for for anyone to have what they would think would be an original thought at this point in humanity is insanity like how how could you have an original thought given the fact that there has been billions of Minds over you know hundreds of thousands of years that saying and and and also even in civilizations that we don't really even know anything about so the thing that you'd have and then you you know kind of some unique thought I think it's more about these hybrids these come combining existing things maybe some new materials kind of or some new stuff changes the way I mean listen my my whole thing around like for example with Laird uh with superfood is really based on using plants in our on the whole form and not separating and taking you know elements out and concentrating it or trying to figure I mean a lot of that's based on really trying to figure out how to get a patent and control and own yeah I feel like listen Nature Made it perfect for your body why don't you use it in those ratios and and it seems like whenever we don't do that as close to Nature as we can there's always a problem there's always a problem whenever you're whenever you're giving the system something that it can't really relate to and I think that that's you know uh I mean at least in in in in in the superfood side of things that's a big that's kind of a philosophy that we use to help govern that that that brand I mean part of the reason why I think there's such a crazy Health thing it was going that way anyway but I think people started to realize after the uh you know I mean since the pandemic happened and that that being healthy is really an advantage you know and I think because we have so much uh like like we're in somewhat of a Health crisis just given you know diabetes and obesity and just all this stuff that's that's been happening uh I think that that the importance again back to what I said earlier about putting value on things you know you put a value on eating really good food you're gonna have really good food if you just are like hey just get that in you know I don't care what it is you know let's just you know go through a drive through and pick it up and just eat it because we we're hungry and we want to get full versus no I want something that really tastes amazing and has you know and is and is nutrient dense and all that stuff so again I think we give the value to the stuff and that will bring you know that'll bring the level and the quality of it but if you don't make it important then and I just I mean yeah I just think that that the and then I have a philosophy about stuff that you do every day anyway like things that you do every day are accumulative right there's an accumulation I mean I mean there was a a technique they used to use to kill the king things in the old days is you just give them a little arsenic right and then eventually you know in a year or two all of a sudden the king croaks and dies but it was never enough to just be POI it wasn't poisoned but it was just an accumulation and I think you know I think that that's true with Fitness I think it's true with with uh you know with your diet if you're just you know if you're if you're eating a little bit of bad food every day that's an accumulative thing if you're eating a little good food every day you know and uh then that's an accumulative thing and I think that's your I think that that there's an opportunity to to really have an impact on your on your health if you're just you know hey I'm doing it I'm doing some training every day I'm you know I'm getting a good night's sleep every day I'm getting I'm getting eating good food every day it's like this stuff over time is gonna pay dividends and it's and it you know it's it's a I mean I I just think that that really speaks back to the philosophy about being patient and being you know you're gonna I told you the story when I worked in downtown L.A with the you know know that with that Korean Guy Mr Chun what brand what brand were they making stuff for he was making uh oxygen um he was building guests and green line so he's building all the guest jackets where they were made out of like old Levi jeans they were they'd take jeans and they'd sew them all together and then they'd Stone wash it like a just like a big Factory with Koreans and he's just paying them nothing I mean well more yeah but exactly yeah but I mean probably paying them and paying them enough that they were able to support their families and and uh but he was had like I said big you know uh tumbling uh washers and dryers with pumice stone but I'd sit in the end and try to pick stuff out I'm like I want to pick some wisdom out of this guy so when I'm sitting there one day and he'd always drink Miller Millers he would drink Millers which is the worst beer ever but that's another story that's what I used to drink Miller Light Miller Light that was my drink it had high alcohol content and low carbs exactly yeah yeah because that's so great it's the worst but he he said you know he goes oh yeah when good times here don't be too happy because after a good time bad time comes but when bad times here don't be too sad because after after bad time good time come again and I'm like there's some wisdom there I mean that means technically you'd be numb if you didn't react to things but there is wisdom in the hey you know when bad times here don't be too sad because after bad time good time come and when you're in the good time don't be too happy so in a way I think there's something to be said about that can I ask you about your house I I've I've studied or I've I've seen your house in the setup and I've talked to a ton of friends you're like oh yeah we went to Laird's which is you're you're like you're you're like the Bono you know you're a one man you're a one-name guy now which is cool but they're like oh we went to layers and we did the pool thing and it was amazing and like one of the things that you've done is like you're living like every like many men's fantasy which is to have this amazing house that's like community and uh yeah people coming and going and it's all on your terms and I think it's pretty cool um what year did you buy that house and how much did it cost would you like you know when that was yeah I mean it was well I don't know I don't remember exact figure but it was cheap for Malibu crazy but we've been here for 25 years 20 26 years so you know what's the values of of you know what I mean things for a million dollars 25 years ago or 25 million now well is that a big deal for you at the time yes oh yeah oh yeah I mean when Gabby when I when we looked at that house because it was the guy had built it for his the guy who built the house built it for himself and and he was a Greek engineer the one here in Malibu uh because I also you know I'm from Hawaii and so we have a home there we just we we just finished during the pandemic but he was building for his house his his family and then he and then during the process I think him and his wife kind of had got divorced which happens a lot to people because building houses is very stressful like it's a very stressful thing but I said to Gabby I go I showed her the house and she looked at the price I go don't look at the price look at the house just think if you want the house like before you look at the price to let it affect you whether you want the house or not look at the house because you know sometimes I think we get in the way of oh well that's how much it is I can't get that and dictate instead of well no so let's see if you want it or not like why would it even matter what the price was if you didn't run it anyway so first let's see if you want it so we went we came and looked at the house and she was like oh it's amazing and I stood across uh at this house I stood across the street I didn't come into the house and I just looked and I could see the ocean I could see this wave that I love to Surf and so I just and I was like I love this house and she's like well you haven't been in the house yet and I go you're like I don't need them in I don't even need to go in the house I'm good if you're good I'm good because I could be on a you know I could have been on a you know in a tent right there looking at the at it so that you know the the what do they say about real estate and rest probably restaurants too but real estate is and houses location location location location location location location it's all everything's about location if you're if you're if people are trying to buy things and for value or keep value or have an increased value it's all about location I mean you can always change the house you can rebuild the house but you can't change where it is and so I I think you know that's one thing about when you grow up in Hawaii and you live in an environment where people work all year to save up to come on vacation for one week and then you live in that environment you kind of I mean if you don't if you have your head screwed on correctly you realize what how fortunate that is you know that that that's a fortunate thing to be that though and those and that those are to be cherished those places that yeah that people seek out to just you know be able to go there for a week and you live there that's a pretty that's a pretty uh fortunate thing but also that you you need to realize that that's that that means it's a special place you know I always see videos of these athletes coming and going how many days a week are you actually having people come and do those workouts in the pool well Gabby does her she has training in the morning it depends on the time of the year you know normally uh most of this is in the summer time because you have football basketball a lot of times it's off season guys come you know I have uh just I'm connected with a lot of different athletes and a lot of different coaches and a lot of different physios and so people you know guys get hurt um and then they're coming out of an injury and then they'll send them to come see to see you know to see us uh are you charging them or is this just like you're just doing it for fun no it's no because it's if you if if you charge people then it's the the dynamic changes you know we really we like to I like to have that sign that says we reserve the right to refuse service to anyone like kind of thing like I think that that's a better that's a better relationship I mean we don't have to we don't we don't need too so it allows us we have the luxury to be able to not have to charge because we're able to you know we're we're there's other ways to to earn a living and so um but that does set up a really nice environment I have like I have a young uh a young man that's been living with us and and training training um and learning about training he's becoming you know very uh versatile and just advanced in because he has such exposure uh and so like he'll I'll we'll get guys to come in and guys that want to get get work you know worked with I'll have him uh and we have other other trainers with xpt and we have other people that we know that hey if somebody needs a trainer and they and they want to run through a lot of this the stuff that we do we'll we'll you know what do we say we have people for that but yeah we have people for that that do that and then the rest of it you know normally we kind of have a communal training uh you know like on on on certain days of the week we have some kind of regulars that kind of come and train on those days uh you know we do like it'll be maybe lifting and and stuff and dry land stuff on on uh you know like Monday Wednesday Fridays and then Tuesday Thursday Saturdays is is can be the pool stuff depending on on uh on who it is and and what we what we do and it's it's not a lot I mean there's at times there could be a fair amount of people um you know the the stuff that we do does weed out some of the people just because it's you know we're we're we're here to work and and it's and it's uh and we have a you know a big probably the most important piece of it is this community right that we have a little that we have a really nice community that that that's what you realize that we all are looking for right we're all looking for a little tribe to belong to I mean that's I would I would uh blame I wouldn't say blame but I'd say that that was part of the success of something like CrossFit that it was really had less to do with the working workout itself as it did that you were part of a tribe and you had a community and people that were like-minded that were training with you and so on so I think that's a big piece of it I think that that uh you know that we need that yeah I mean listen some days you're just down and you're like hey you know I don't feel like doing anything today and then somebody's out there okay ready to go and then you're like okay let's go and then you just so you know and vice versa they might not be and you are and so I think that we we kind of lift each other up I think that that's part of I mean we humans are communal creatures and I think we operate well that way as long as we have like-minded people um I was looking at like some old photos uh of of folks in your pool I think there was like uh and yeah you had a whole bunch of basketball players yeah joking Noah Grant Hill a few other people who who have you worked out with back there that has uh put you in awe of of their Fitness or their athletic ability I mean listen I get so many crazy guys I think I I mean my problem is I probably have a skewed bar like my you know I don't because I'm with normally I'm always with all these freaks right so it's a little bit like hard to out Freak the freak you know like you when you got you know I got when you guys got you got you know guys like Chris McCaffrey or or or you know or Jalen or I mean just you just have the level of athlete that you have is I mean I think there's some there's always you know the the the the the people that surprise you are probably people you haven't heard of that that come there that that have a certain mindset because some of the pool stuff that we do can be it's stressful you know and so sometimes you know you you'd think you'd get this big super strong guy and he freaks out and then you get some kind of more frail you know lady that just has a you know Mental Giant and can just handle you know being in the ice and drowning in the deep end and you know so it doesn't I think it's pretty uh that's why it's kind of neutralizing there's a neutralizing aspect to the environment because it's first of all you're always going to have somebody that you know you're always gonna you're always gonna you're always gonna have somebody that can out you do you in something right you can outdo them they cannot do you and so our approach is more about you finding your own barriers and then trying to lift those up right you try to you try to and and don't use other people as a reference to you I think that's where we run and try you know we get in trouble is you start comparing you get over there and you're like okay that guy's doing this and which what do they say comparison is the depth of Happiness I'm not sure but joy something like that man I I I've always hated that phrase when they say comparisons of thief of Joy because I'm like yeah that's true I shouldn't compare myself but I love to compete and so like well that's you know but that's different that's different comparing and competing yeah like I like seeing guys and I'm or in business and I'm like this person's doing this Revenue they're at 50 million I'm like oh that dumbass could do that I definitely could do 70. let's crush them or like I've got a joke I'm like people like oh you gotta let go of that Grudge and I'm like this Grudge fuels everything I do I've like I like the reason I like work out hard is to like prove my ex-girlfriend from high school that like you were worthy yeah yeah you made a mistake yeah look everything I do is because everything I do is because of a grudge I'm like rage is the greatest feel on Earth and so when people say like comparisons to Peep and joy I'm like I get so much joy proven like these idiots wrong and like letting a 20-year comment sit on my back for those years about how I wasn't like you know fit enough or successful enough like I love that stuff you know what I mean yeah but you will but you know what interesting because that's I I will say because I can relate to that I mean listen a lot of what I've done is because of that like so but then at a certain point then you get to this thing and then you're like okay then what then at some point you achieve the thing you're trying to do you prove your point and then you're sitting there going okay now what and then you're like okay do I have to make up a new one or maybe I can create motivation out of out of of success or contentment or something versus so I think there is two I think that can be I know for myself personally I've gone through you know being driven and motivated uh to achieve certain things because of you know frustration and proving the work to the world and and you know and all those things that I went through that drove me but then but then you achieve it and then you're like okay now what you know what am I gonna do now like now how I'm gonna adjust to be able to continue and so if at least in my I can say Hey you know and listen if you're a competitor you're a competitor that's just a vicious like for me I think I'm I'm such a vicious competitor that that I would I almost I can't I can barely actually even compete because I just because of because in in a real if you look at real if you look at competition in nature and the brutality of it like the real like the real thing not just these contrived things of like the real like for real yeah then you're like okay well maybe I better figure out how to constructively vent that stuff do you does that does that does that carry over to to business too I mean are you talking uh I think Mike I think I think his name's Mike your new CEO are you like you know we need I want this much profit we need this much growth does that carry over to business as well yeah I mean not not that not that way no I mean it it you know I mean it maybe it should but it not that I think it's mine is a more you know mine is a patient thing like I have a like I you know my favorite term is the victory through attrition there's be a cockroach that's like like like the last guy standing like I'm all about that like you can be like yeah yeah yeah you can have your little wins your little wins and your little wins and all great but I'm talking about like at the end when you're the only one left on the battlefield and everybody's laying on the ground then you don't even have to be any good you don't even have to be good you're just Undisputed you're the guy because so and I think I think for me I feel like and and I'm looking at the greatest competition is life right the greatest competition is life like you want to talk about the real game the game the real game like because all these other things they're games they're right but the real game the big game is life the big game is you know is like the quality of like at the like relationship father you know how like your life like that's the big game that's the real game that's why I said when I talk about the spoke I go yeah business that's one spoke make sure it's nice and tight good cool but if you're all there then you got these giant holes in the other spot I'm like sorry lost the game already but you you you've not always been that way have you I think I read some old stuff where like I think your wife filed for divorce and one at one point and you guys like you've thankfully made it work I think an 0-1 yeah I think you I don't I don't remember if I read that you had a drinking problem but I think you said that uh you wish you had told your younger self to quit drinking earlier so I don't know if that was like a problem or not uh like I know that you and if I just were just a stereotype you I'm like I bet you were like a wild guy and anyone if I'm stereotyping a surfer who like goes out hard it does everything hard I'm like I'm sure I bet you picked some of your vices uh with that same or you use that same energy sometimes toward devices when did did were you kind of like uh you weren't always this wise I'm sure and what made that switch well no I mean well okay let's let's be let's be clear that for sure work right sure work in process work in process now working process then I mean I I always you know love sleep I always like even within my I mean I the thing like my thing about drinking like I love I love wine I drank I that was when I always said I had I had two French habits because I worked with a French company for 20 years and my two French habits were espresso and Pinot Noir and then it was like and and like every thing I do I have a tendency to do it you know in excess like if one's good then two is better so that's the mentality and so in a way but as far as like as far as kind of my I mean listen at first of all I would have never first I never Gabby and I would never have gotten to be together if I didn't have a certain if I had didn't have a certain I'd say calculation morality values I mean there's certain things that were that I've had my whole life right that since I was since I was young it wasn't like I got them I had I had the basis of it and then that's been just a process of refinement again oh loose spoke like hey you know what this this this drinking thing's an issue because I don't have real power over it I want to prove to myself I do I come from a you know I always say I come from a long line alcoholics but we all do I think it's a human you know I I always say out being alcoholics like being a surfer there's no one that doesn't love surfing well there's no human being that doesn't actually like alcohol it's just whether you die I love it too I'm uh yeah I'm 10 years sober too yeah I loved it so I got 15 here I got 15 not but but my thing was like a you know my mom said to me once when I was a kid she said if you can't be true to yourself you can't be true to anyone else and so I thought let me see if I say hey I can stop drinking anytime and then the next day I drank or the next week or the or the next month then I really don't have a lot of power over right so then I want to have so now I want to be like I want to have some power over it and so that was a discipline thing too and you know what I saw also said in all the dumbest things I ever did were when I was drinking that all the stupidest things I ever I've ever done usually some alcohol was somehow involved in there because because it like it says in the bottle impairs your motor skills so so let's not forget so and so in in in a way uh those things like the in my relationship the rocky times and relationship those refined you know and and and motivate you to make changes you know all those things okay the drink in the thing you know like just all these different these things that and there's things I'm still working on and probably will always be but that's a continuation of of trying to to uh get better like get get get better and not and and which means that you're saying hey there's things that you think you could do better or you could be better or you could make changes or you could you know whatever whatever those are I mean they're you know what do they say about Sin you know let he without sin cast the first stone no one seems to be able to throw one because everybody falls short so I mean it's about being honest too like being honest with yourself and being like okay what is it what it what do I what is it which which thing and then you know what you just start eliminate you start okay let me let's work on that one let's work on this one and then and then as you go and so that's I mean I'm in that I'm in that in that uh process and and and and and then you get success you get you get you get success I mean I use I used to use the guilt from drinking to make me feel motivated about training so I'd be like oh yeah I could drink Pinot Noir cup you know bottle two bottle three bottles no problem eat dinner go to sleep wake up 5 a.m train like an animal what's the problem no problem there's a problem I don't see a problem you could train hungover oh yeah like an animal oh [ __ ] that you puke in the ocean using that using that guilt using that guilt and prove like approved like all proof let me show you what a man I am you know I'll show you what I can do and so I I hope your pool had a good filter man the worst but but like I said my drinking problem had to do with wine only never a hard you know I mean okay not never hard booze but I was pretty smart about that but uh uh but even within that I had you know there was some sort of control but I'm just speaking in general as a thing to refine right as you go let's just try to let's try to continue to to to polish the stone [Music] see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better you're kind of going like one path down this longevity thing and healthy living thing that I love but I love freak shows I love like people who are just oddballs and a guy we had on here one time his name's Brian Johnson have you seen Brian Johnson from blueprint I mean he's like total freak Show when it comes to longevity and I love that people are brave enough to do what he's doing because like you can always learn cool songs when you're doing extremes isn't he blending his food every day I think Gabby did a podcast on him is that the guy he he's doing all time yeah that's basically he's liking everything yeah he's like I'll like give you I'll give you like the the clip notes but basically he's uh probably close to a billionaire so he started a company that he sold so he's got plenty of income and money to like be playing around but basically he's like I want to become the most tested person on planet Earth and I'm gonna try to he goes I'm gonna try to uh decrease my biological age faster than my chronological age which obviously is going to be impossible at one point but he was like let's just see if I can get make my body younger even though my age gets older and so he like does crazy amounts of tests where he's doing tests weekly and he's spending millions of dollars doing it and he blogs and documents it all on his website blueprint but some of the crazy stuff that he's doing is he's like well through my tests are showing that like this vegan diet or vegan lifestyle is working well for me therefore I am only going to eat these same three things every day and he like measures the calories down to like the thou he's like you know it's got to be this amount of calories this servings the workout has to be this and I'm like I love that weirdos like that exists because we're gonna be able to learn some cool stuff from him have you been paying attention to that and what do you think about those people that are a little bit less I mean he I don't know if he's like I think at one point you said um science follows intuition with him it's like let's go science and let's see how that makes me feel uh but have you been paying attention to that and what's your what's your take well Gabby did a show on on Brian and uh a podcast went and interviewed him and and so here and I have a conversation when she kind of filled me in about some of the stuff that he was doing did she go to his house she did yeah she didn't she ate something she ate some of his goulash she ate some of his The Nutty yeah his Blended blended it and I mean listen you know when you chew food when you chew food you create saliva that you create enzymes in your mouth that go down with the food to help digest the food and the one of the worst if one of the ways if you really want to become like allergic or have a an allergy against something is just eat that alone every day all day but but that gets into I'm into a whole you know I'm I I'm into I guess for me I just feel like you can't hack your way around biology in my in my in my world of my thought and it is interesting I think you can use hacking to support work you know I think I think uh first of all I think in the diet one of the most important things is diversity I think that's one of the most important I mean the problem is is it's hard to to not get bombarded by a bunch of you know things that aren't good for you as well but you know through that so it'll be it'll be it would be interesting to to I mean Gabby would be a better person to have the conversation about but I am always interested in watching I think there's so much uh I don't know he I mean I do appreciate that he's doing like the guys going through going through it but but as far as you know what what you know were what we are and what we're doing and what we need I'll be interested you know I'll be interested to see uh first of all what would it what it you know what it does I um I think more as an entertainment that's what I'm saying like I I love that like uh I don't know if you pay attention to fighting but you know who uh Nate do you watch fighting like MMA I don't I don't watch a lot of it I know I know I have a bunch of guys I know that do it but I I yeah I mean I I like I I always say I love a freak Show I like fighting boxing I mean I love just like what do you think about Crazy Event what do you think about uh uh wrestling WWE wrestling or WWE I I mean I love that stuff do you watch that what's that oh yeah we'll have a friend of mine my friend or mine bring brought me to it I never even watched it and I have a friend that really is into it and so he he he brought me and I go with him but I only I live vicariously through him because I'm Amazed just how how Intuit he is how much he knows about it it's just a grill man soap opera no it's fun I love this tour you know it goes to our deepest it serves a purpose oh yeah it does it goes right to that joke guy in his underwear it's like fighting and arguing about [ __ ] you know what I mean like let's just like I just like I like me I like weirdos I like freaks just like let it be well and also people from outside really they think they actually think that the audience thinks that everything what's going on is real they don't realize that everybody in the audience knows exactly what's going on and they're just participating in the whole show and then it's all the fun whole thing it's pretty so yeah the humans are I mean listen humans are entertaining and and you know just watch them when you're like I uh I have this like image in my head of of what you are uh and like you running your businesses I'm like is he like totally out of the picture on a database on a day-to-day basis and just talks to the CEO once a month and I was like actually what's that what would that look like like when we got on here your uh wife helped set up the camera are you even using a computer or a phone on a daily basis are you totally detached yeah no I'm I I'm I'm I use a phone uh I'm not I'm not I'm not a social media a guy I don't spend very I mean this is my the phone for me is communication weather weather and news and new and new stuff that that and when I say news I mean more like investigation stuff like but but I mean listen I I'm what's investigation stuff uh just trying to understand what the truth is about whatever and everything so they just it just I'm I I go into if I'm interested in something if that you know if I'm interested in some political thing I I like to look like understand exactly from my own not just take the the advice of people that are telling you about it but actually like understand the real stuff so I have a tendency to but I'm just using like I said the thing for a tool so I I hardly I hardly use it I talk to Jason all the time I talk to uh you know blurred apparel uh the lady you know the lady that's that's running that right now yeah I'm in communication with these because because it's first of all it's got my name on it so it you know it's it's has to do with my brand and and we're just we're vested in the in in it and interested in it so we're I mean all this the the uh I mean I'm all also yeah I mean we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we're we spend you know we're we're multiple times a week if not every single day I'm communicating with those Brands uh and and you know either discussing okay promotional this or or product development or you know whatever whatever yeah we're we're so I um I uh I I think I told you I I had started this company and sold it and uh when I was 30. so I was able to like uh financially get some some some really nice security there yeah and I look at the type of life that you live where um so I also I split time between Austin and New York my wife's from New York and so we we spend there all the time and I have a handful of projects uh that I'm working on I got a a company with a CEO that runs it so a a bit similar ish to what you're doing and God willing some of them will be huge what I'm curious about because there aren't that many people in the situation where I want to go to um and where I'm in now but you definitely are uh which is how do you break up how are you how do you map out your personal finances so because you said that you have this one Farm as a project you have three or four five different businesses right now you have two or who knows what you have how much real estate do you just like is there just like one Revenue stream where you're like that's just the like for example the app might have high margins so you're like oh we'll just live off that or media appearances I bet you I can just pay I can make a million bucks a year and that will be what I live off of and then all the rest I'm gonna reinvest or I'll put into the a Vanguard just normal Index Fund how does that how do you balance all your different things when it comes to a personal finance space uh uh I mean well I first of all I have smarter people at that than me so I have I have I have I have P you know I have advice people that that you know I have specific specifically a woman that I work that we've worked with for a very long time that does like you know management that that sort of stuff I would say uh accounting and and Finance Management just because that's she's into it and and and good at it and that's what she's interested in so we we have it we have that you know that's a big a big piece of it I I think that uh you know I I think one of the I mean for me personally I don't I I think that that can be a a such a consuming hole like that all of that stuff that you can just get swallowed into that and and lose every you know lose your connection with everything as well I think that you have to I I you know well part of it has to do with how you look at it like what's your what's your you know what's your faith you know like what kind of Faith do you have what kind of belief do you have that everything's going well or not going well and you think that you're going to control everything and that you know how much control do you think you have and all those things I think that's a piece of my I think of my My Philosophy um what so does that mean that you just don't stress out a significant amount about finances and like earlier you said when I bought that house you're like oh that was a lot of money for us back then but I was like [ __ ] it we're doing it anyway we'll figure it out yeah that's kind of like your your how you live when it comes to finances yeah which is which I I think for a lot of people they just can't operate like that and I think I think I think for me I just feel that just feels more that just feels better I I I just feel that feels more natural I just feel that you know because the because I I just you know I've Just Seen I've first of all I've had I've had the fortune to be exposed to a lot of wealthy people in my life like a lot of crazy wealth and and and seeing people that had no nothing and all of a sudden they got everything and I've seen people with everything and they lose everything and so I've gotten to watch a lot of it and I just feel like you know there there's a level of imprisonment that happens when you when you you know and and I think I mean a lot that's why when I say faith I mean you know they talk about about you know you you saving up you know in your Warehouse with you know where moth and rust can eat you know like you know like there's some stuff to do with that I think which I think you can't you can't oh it is not so simple to to to be that way and I think it's harder for uh you know I think it's a it's a hard it's hard for people to to to operate like that but having that you know having that belief it's like people talk about visualization and visualizing and you know having that I mean it's real that's that's the real stuff like if if you think it's not real you're you're mistaken that you you you you thing you can you can make things your belief in it definitely will be supportive of it happening I can tell you that for sure in both ways right like in both ways you can make things be you know like Gabby says if you have an ouch God will give you a hurt you know if you walk around going ouch ouch ouch you'll be surprised if stuff isn't just hitting you all the time and so and I think vice versa it's the same way the other way which is you know uh what is that if you know yo Yi of little faith I provide for the birds you don't think I'll provide for you like so there's some of that that's real stuff like they didn't just make that stuff up out of the sky that's a real that's real thing so I think there's something to be said about that doesn't mean be stupid and you know when doesn't mean just uh you know just ignore your your reality but but there is something about that that's real that that I think can put you in the right State of Mind to not just be caged by this stuff because this is the caging area that's an area that we can be cage and I'm I'm one of them I'm I I get I'm caged by it's like when I I was broke and then I was not broke and I'm like oh [ __ ] I've just like created a prison a little bit where you get where you stress out over running out yeah yeah we're scarcity creatures right so we have this whole scarcity thing that's in us right so so and you know my mom had another good saying which was be uh the way God punishes you is he gives you what you ask for so be careful what you ask for because you go hey I just want that you know I want that big house and then you're like yeah and then all of a sudden with that house comes all this other stuff like all the stuff that comes with it which means that there's a bunch of stuff to break and there's a bunch of thing and there's a bunch of stuff to maintain and there's a you know it's so it and you know and that could be overwhelming I think I think that you know that's why you see these guys that are these big these big hitters they're they're kind of they're not bogged down by all that little stuff right they're not they're looking in they're looking in in a at a bit at a bigger um a bigger thing but that being said you know uh you know like I said there's there's something about being prudent in and having the right people around you that could that that you because it's it takes it it takes a what do they say it takes a village but it you know you got to have you got to have people that to help because there's not you can't do everything you can you know and it's like and so that you you need to be you're only as good as you know as The Company You Keep so I think that that's another important piece too like people well uh no I mean and that that's one of the reasons why I look up to we've had um I don't know if you know what Rob Dyrdek is but he's pretty amazing where uh he's another guy where I'm like Laird and Rob they've nailed it where business nailed it personal life you never have totally nailed that but you like are do really well Fitness nailed it like self-awareness nailed it um I know you uh we'll wrap up here in a minute but my last question was um I think last year on your guys's YouTube Gabby asked you what are your goals for it was at the end of 2022 she said what are your goals for 2023 you go uh this year I want to be more of a Savage I want to be more set I want to do more Savage stuff like I want to get like dirty and do something what as an example we're we're more than halfway through the year what's an example of something that you've done so far that's Savage and you also talked about visualization over the next six months and 18 months are there any particular experiences or goals that you're trying to do that would be that would check that box of being more of a Savage well I mean I'm I mean listen I have the nature I have for me here I'll I'll give you an example for me I've always wanted to kill an animal I wanted to go and kill a deer or some type of I have cows in my Ranch I was like I want to slaughter it with my hands and I want to eat it I was like I don't do that enough and I eat a ton of meat I gotta do that yeah and like that's my that's that's an example for me which is not that very uh that's not too Savage but what do you have well I go for I go uh I go for moose you know I go for a move I go for probably in September I'll be I'll go get a moose and and so I can feel the cool fill the freezers for the winter but I grew up at a farm too so I'm already I've dealt with the you know and I've hunted when I was a kid we hunted boar and stuff like that I mean for me that the Savage stuff comes more with the with the with the ocean you know like with with the conditions um I had one trip already to uh uh I had one trip to Peru this summer I mean we're just my my most of my Savage stuff comes from the environment so I need to you know and and and normally you know I mean listen I I just we had that giant Malibu fire um I had to I had I fought my house for you know I fought that I saw that four or five hours with a suit and a pump and and then I had a flood in Hawaii after and I was like you know at night with boats it you know rescuing people off the top of their roofs to their houses and stuff and so I have to be careful um what I asked for because before both of those things I said I just need some action you know I just so again you know back to what my mom said be careful what you asked for be careful oh yes yeah you got to clarify so you have to clarify what uh you know what what that what that is you know I think it's because it's easy to make a blanket statement I just wanna you know it's like I said when I was young I wanted to be surrounded by women women uh you know that goalie I just want to be surrounded by women like and then well now you are right yeah yeah I have three daughters so you know again I should have been a little more uh uh how clear in my defi definition do you read a lot of books um I listened to a lot of books but I read I read some and I'll read and listen but I but I listen to a lot what are the best two that you've listened to in the last 12 or 18 months so um well I did I did I liked uh there was a book called Life After Life that I really um I I really enjoyed um by uh what's his name Moody um and then uh let me see the uh you know there's a there's a gnarly a really pretty heavy one called Embrace The Fearless uh embrace fearlessly the burning World by uh Barry Lopez he's he's pretty radical um and then I went I went full conspiracy uh oh actually the the psychology of totalitarianism was pretty was a pretty heavy book that's the one you were referring to when you said you went full conspiracy no the the full conspiracy was called The Trap that one's called the Trap um I I go I kind of go all over the place I have a really good one on water right now uh you know I I'm uh I I like fiction I I like you know I like factual books I'm not a big Fiction guy I like I like can I give you um so I read a ton I read about I only read history basically so mostly historical stuff okay but I'm gonna give you three three in particular okay I I thought that you would like you know Dan Carlin of course Hardcore History yeah because Dan We Know Dan Dan's a buddy of ours really he's cool yeah I'm gonna give you three in particular that you're gonna dig okay the first is called The Wager so the first two books I'm suggesting are ship books it's about uh shipping uh ships in the 1800s yep so the first one is called The Wager and so these crazy guys would sail you know their 1800s ship yeah from England all the way down through uh yeah Argentina and K porn yep and they got stranded and it took them two years to get back so you'll dig that one the second one is called the heart of the sea it's this uh if you've ever Read Moby Dick you know about the whale that sinks the ship yes there's actually a true story behind it and so Nantucket originally was for Quakers yeah you were whale men yep and so these whale men with they would they're [ __ ] animals you want to be talking about Savage imagine sailing a ship with no electricity no like way to talk to anyone for two years all the way over sometimes to the Pacific to Africa yeah and they um basically their ship was in the middle of the Pacific and it's about how they got back to South America and then the last one that I think you'll really dig because I wanted to give you three books on being a Savage the last one was called on undaunted courage and it's about the story of Lewis and Clark okay Lewis and Clark's they were they were Savages I I like their Zone I've been up in Washington where they're where their their Trail was in their their hardcore those guys are they're honorable yeah they were bad to the [ __ ] bones they weren't killing anybody they were just they were making Maps so yeah yeah and they would meet these Natives and they were like Hey we're we're in peace we're going to be cool with you but it took them two years two years and four months to go from St Louis to the Pacific and back and it's a crazy story yeah so those are the three that I would recommend for you and then I just finished a story about uh John Wilkes Booth the guy who killed uh Abe Lincoln and The 12-day Manhunt to find him so I read a ton of that stuff but yeah there was a great particular I just had to Ocean one too that I I can't remember what it is that uh it's about the uh oh what's it called I can't anyway there was a great one a sailing one about the race from Hobart like the race from New Zealand uh the the one that they and there's like is there a is there a storm is there a storm in that one yeah crazy storm and the and the boat and the the guys get yeah it's it's intense on that race stuff yeah yeah those those stories you know I work on my computer throughout the day the the hardest points in my life are if I go boxing or if I have a hard workout and I'm like I need some pain in my life in order to realize that like yeah to turn down my the volume of my daily life because my daily life is soft so I need to read about something hard because I can't exactly go and experience lots of hard things so this is why I like like reading about these books particularly the [ __ ] book so I thought you'd you you'd get a kick out of those absolutely well yeah because those are those are I mean at Sea is a real thing and especially those guys weren't exactly uh watermen too like you fall off the boat you die those guys those guys I don't know couldn't even swim which is crazy that's what I'm saying they weren't exactly like yeah no they couldn't even swim and they would live on a ship for 20 years of their life they didn't even know how to swim and also if you fell off a ship in the ocean those those sailboats or the ships they can't turn around exactly you know what I mean so they just [ __ ] left you you're like you're done oh yeah yeah it's it's uh that's hard core well we we live in a pretty soft time right now this is a pretty this is it is soft it is soft which I'm thankful for in some capacity oh yeah you know like there's no doubt but like so so that's why I think particularly young men I think yeah well that's why they like you I think is because they see you risking your life on on a wave and then they like all right well I'm not willing to risk my life in a way but I'll go to a pool and lift out and work uh move weights at the bottom of the pool because at least uh that's a little bit of hard you know what I mean I think that's why a lot of young men admire you yeah well the stress is good it's it we need it we're designed for it you know that kind of constructive stress that you can control the environment uh and and because it's the other one if you induce it you don't always have the you don't have as much participation in the outcome if it's just being subject if you're being subjected to it you know like a giant wave it can decide not to let you up versus at least in the pool you can always just let go your weights and swim to the surface but we kind of have to induce it now it's almost like we're forced it you know a lot of the stuff that we're doing is we're inducing things that we were getting naturally like we were getting it from it's like now we don't get enough Sun so we got to supplement and take vitamin D it's like we're having this we're having to make up for the fact that we're not getting a lot of this stuff that we need biologically and then that's and that stress that's why the Heat and ice is great that's why the breath work was great that's why the pool stuff is great because it's it's a one one of the ways to stress to stress the system because the system really needs for it to really work correctly it needs a certain amount of stress and not stress of hey I owe taxes or hey I'm in in the traffic but like some other stress that's a little more you know a little more just purely physical so yeah I remember um looking at uh buying a treadmill from my desk and then I like was like what the [ __ ] am I doing this life I'm gonna put a [ __ ] walking treadmill on a desk I smack myself I was like this is not the life man I'm this is literally a hamster wheel what am I doing I'm not buying a treadmill for a desk if I gotta buy a treadmill for a desk I'm I'm broken I've lost yeah but we're almost forced into that so we don't I mean it's like I was like I said I was in Europe and all they do is walk over there you know it's like they do a lot of walking we don't walk as nearly as much because we just don't live in those I mean I guess in New York you can you know where you have where you can just if you want you can just there you can force yourself you have to force yourself but in Europe they really do it a lot they do a lot of walking and you realize how well we we our system really does well with walking like we're designed we're Walkers like that's our one of our big Evolutions was that we came up off all fours and started walking and so our metabolism and everything just functions a lot better when we walk and so uh it's it's you know it's like you said here now we're having to like buy things so we can stand in a room and walk it's terrible yeah I know I I I almost bought one and then I was going I like went through an existential crisis I'm like what am I doing I don't have to do this force yourself to go for a walk in the park or something you know make them make time right well I appreciate you doing this I I really admire you I I I admire the family you've built the the life that you built um I'm excited that uh we were able to talk Sam I really appreciate your time and thank you I appreciate the admiration and uh you know what it seems like you're you're already you're already uh there already so that's the that's it I I'm basically uh I I read history because I like to uh see the mistakes as well as the wins that people have made and that's one of the reasons why I like following you is I'm just like what wins did he make and you know that kind of helps point to me to the direction what mistakes did he make I I'm gonna try and avoid that one yeah and hopefully uh uh it works out but you've definitely kind of paved the path for me and a bunch of other people so I appreciate that I think I think that's one of the things that makes humans unique is that we can learn from the other people you know how to and how not to it's like so that's the that's a that's one one of the things that really helps us you know is that we can if we can I mean the best is to learn from other people's mistakes you know but we have a tendency sometimes the need to make them ourselves that's part of part of Being Human I think too so all right I appreciate you man thanks for coming [Music] foreign

I've met a lot of successful people and I've noticed huge outsized results and massive massive wealth typically comes from one thing and then once they get incredibly successful it appears as though they have a lot of things going on but those a lot of things are like five percent when it comes to net worth creation one of my good friends Andrew Wilkinson he owns a private Equity company where they buy businesses and so he owns like 40 businesses but his one thing is buying companies so I have to remind myself on a regular basis that big results typically come from one thing

after they sent to the money they would get a document called a guide to my new life that included winning lottery numbers and so this guy did this and uh he did it so well that he was making 20 million dollars a year doing this [Music] what's up dude according to the YouTube data by the end of this sentence half the audience will have dropped off that's how content goes nowadays you have like 4.2 seconds to hook everybody is that true it was is it really that short I thought it was like a joke but it is like that I mean like after somebody clicks play you just see the curve start to go Space Mountain downwards and then uh and then it flattens out but are you looking at the data like I I rarely log in you just let it Flash the camera in the first five seconds every every time so there you go you know how like there's a joke about news anchors wearing like uh shorts with me it's the sleeveless t-shirt I'm going jacked it sleeveless tea baby how's that for flashing foreign I mean I don't even know what you're prepared for you're like I can go outside it can rain I can become a doctor for a minute I can work out I can climb a mountain it's 107 degrees in Austin today and so I'm either shirtless or sleeveless tea most of the time when I record I got to put the jacket on so I look a little professional dude I've been trying to convince Ben to move to California from Austin I originally pegged it at a 15 chance what's what's it at now oh I think we're like up to 50. I think we've made serious Headway now I put in all this work what I needed to do was just wait for summer just smoke them out right all I had to do was just smoke them out I don't know if I ever told you this I once was doing a deal that required us to negotiate with a company called Petro China Petro China is basically like Exxon Mobil but it's owned by the government in China and so we go to this and they're like the big they're like you know huge company but it's owned by the government so nobody knows how much it's worth all that stuff but it's Mega powerful oil and gas company in China so we go and we're supposed to negotiate this deal and I I kid you not they just they did the opposite of smoking us out or sweating us out they just froze us out they put us in a room that was like just cold as hell and there was no way out like first getting to the room was like a 20 minute walk like a like a passage like going through this Labyrinth of doors and we'd get to this room we're in they're like they'll be with you soon and then they leave and seven hours pass and we're sitting in this room and I'm like hey I think they forgot about us and we got to go talk to somebody and then I tried to stand up and immediately an arm like puts me back in the chair they're like no no this is part of to freeze you just yeah just to make it uncomfortable and they're like you show no weakness here we just sit and there's this uh Urban myth I don't know if it's true or not or Steve Cohen uh you know one of the guys who apparently is based off of uh his billions characters based off of him Steve Cohen rich guy owns the Mets where the reason why Patagonia vests are popular on Wall Street is he used to make his office freezing so when the SEC Regulators would come in they were really uncomfortable and everyone knew they didn't want to stay yeah they didn't want to stay but so apparently it works dude I mean my Costco has a walk-in freezer where you go get like our walk-in fridge where you but it's a room it's a giant room where you go get vegetables that thing is so uncomfortable I mean it's like whatever's the nearest vegetable that's all I'm getting and then I'm getting out of there so I definitely believe it if I was the SEC I would I would get the [ __ ] out of there I want to tell you about this thing that when people read it they probably didn't have the same reaction as I did but I think they should so there's this guy it's called the greatest scam ever written and it's about a copywriter who ran this scam his name was Patrice Runner and so it started basically in the 90s where he originally saw this ad have you ever heard of this book called The Lazy Man's way to riches yes so I don't remember when that originally came out I think in the 60s but the Lazy Man's way to riches is a really famous ad it sold like three or four million copies of this book and the ad is famous amongst copywriters because it was really successful and a lot of the copywriting that we use now for the internet they kind of originated from that ad and this guy Patrice Runner he saw this ad and he was poor and he was like I don't want to be poor anymore it's pretty amazing that this guy just convinced me to buy this book based off of just like uh you know 20 paragraphs of text that's amazing I want to learn how to do that and so he did and so we start studying copywriting and he reads a newspaper about this lady named like Madame Duvall Maria Duvall was her name and basically there was a story about her and how there was a murder in the Caribbean and how they couldn't find where the body is and she was a psychic and she led the people to where the body was and I don't know if that's actually true if she actually did that but it was in the newspaper that that happened and so he contacted her it was like look I want to sign up create this psychic company and I want you to be the face and I'm going to give you five percent of profits forever and you really don't even need to do anything other than like let me use your face occasionally and that's it so she signs up for it and he starts creating these ads where he would mail people these letters that looked like it was typed out and it was from Maria Duvall and it would use these amazing like bits of copy so like the thing would say like the opening line was if you've got a special bottle of bubbly that you've been saving for celebrating great news now's the times now is the time to open it up and that would be like the opening line and it was a nine page letter that he would send to people and he would say like you know send me uh forty dollars or fifty dollars and we will like uh you you'll have good luck it was basically like you send money and you get nothing and then eventually it was like oh you sent 40 we're gonna keep sending you more letters and they would send like two letters a day sometimes so someone oftentimes would receive two letters and they would send like an ad for some vitamin that you would need to take and recipients basically it said the recipients were urged to reply and close a check or money order for fifty dollars to receive a mysterious uh bit of power and luck in order to attract money as and then also they would after they accepted the money they would get a document called a guide to my new life that included winning lottery numbers and so this guy did this and uh he did it so well that he was making 20 million dollars a year doing this and eventually the thing ran for 10 years and it made 250 million dollars and then the government swoops in and they're like dude this is fraud and so now he's in jail and he's waiting sentencing but he might get up to life in prison so like he's looking at like at least like 20 years of prison for this and he they were like why'd you do this he's like I was just so attracted to copywriting and with writing he told the reporter this is all from this uh an article from uh called The Walrus it was a great article and they show you like what the ads look like but we'll talk about that in a second but it goes with writing you could get get the attention of someone and at the end after just a few minutes that person sends you a check to get a project uh to get a product to an address or a company that they've never heard of and when I read stories like this that should be the takeaway which is not like this criminal is bad but how do I use this amazing copywriting stuff actually for good and if you click on the article you'll see the envelopes would have these amazing things like we're on the back of the envelope it would say something like um after you've sealed this envelope we will be the only one to have ever opened it and it says please leave the following blank and it says here's the day we received it here's the time that we received it and the recipient who's supposed to be Maria Duvall would have to check the box in order to like say like yep I've opened it and they put all these little like strange like tactics of getting someone to convince and believe what they were saying it's incredibly fascinating so it's called the uh the the publication they did the nautical on this guy it's called The Walrus it's really good because you should read this and think like copywriting is amazing this guy was a fraud obviously so that's bad well whatever he did do that for good [ __ ] and it's awesome it's a really fascinating article about this guy but yeah now he's going to get sentenced to like it looks like 20 years of prison and you know who else did this this great copywriter uh great copywriter Gary Halbert you remember Gary Halbert so yeah why did he go to jail I didn't actually know it was tax tax something yeah tax I think tax and also basically he would sell this product I think it was called a family uh was it called a suit of arms what's it called a Crest like a family crest he would sell this product whereas like you mail in like par and then you get mailed back like a Crest I don't know if it's like a graphic but he just didn't fulfill the orders he just took the money and like bounced it was just like I'm easy to do that too to just give him a Crest like yeah he just he completed Fiverr he was just too early yeah and so he went to prison I think for like 10 years and that's where he wrote this really good book where it's like he wrote letters to his son on copywriting and that's called the letters from Boron I guess Boron was the name of the prison that he was in but these copywriters it's really cool how you're able to pull this [ __ ] off and you by the way people act like you can't do this anymore because people are smarter that's not true the 100 can still pull off all this it's very fascinating uh I'm with you I think this is one way that we are very very similar where we both read these things and have the same sort of like uh unexpected reaction which is some blend of like excitement and admiration not for the crime but for the the tools that led to the like you know it's the same skill it definitely 11. it's like robbing a bank I like I like it I like the I like what goes in dropping that bank right um it's like you shouldn't like the criminal in this case but you are attracted to the skill to the cleverness to the um to the guile that goes into doing something well every guy who saw Lino DiCaprio in Wolf of Wall Street or Catch Me If You Can was like hey Mom can I can you give me one of your checks I want to see if I can actually change the numbers on it like everyone like you know what I mean like everyone who saw that was do the same thing or like everyone looked up like you know Stratford Oakmont Jordan Belford's thing after they uh Wolf Wall Street movie like everyone's attracted cards or whatever right now right they're like oh I could counting cards how does that work I could do that you had a great bit of copy that I read on Facebook the other day you go there you go the more shirtless pictures I I post the more free protein I'm sent some asked me to some asked to pay me to post I've never done that and I don't intend to but here's some brands that I use blah blah blah there you go we may be [ __ ] in the par household but we're certainly not that's so good where did you get that I stole that from Ari Gold so uh Ari Gold that TV show Entourage so every great copywriter does the same thing where you do this too you hear phrases you hear phrases and you store them and you just store them and so every single person who's good at writing you have a bank that you just we call it a swipe file but I remember even when I was in sixth grade watching Entourage at Sunday night at 9 00 pm on HBO I remember hearing that I go that's mine I'm stealing that one and you just wait for that perfect opportunity to use those lines dude I have my my it's literally called he says he said phrases literally my sheet is called my note is called phrases um and I just have so many good here I love it because what people don't know is like phrases are really important so I'm working on this with Hampton actually where we're trying to create like our Mantra or like with every type of community it's basically a cult or sorority where you like you need like a phrase that summarizes it neither Crest you need a Crest I need a Crest like I need something and I've been like tinkering with phrases and it's so important to like nail a phrase and like there's so many like really good phrases um like for example I'm reading this book about Martin Luther King's assassination and he was assassinated uh while well basically he was at this protest for garbage workers black garbage workers were uh were wanting to be treated better and their phrase was just I am and it was underlined I am a man and like that like that one phrase is it should be like a you know I'm not I'm not a slave anymore I'm a man treat me like a man and so it's like all these phrases and I just like well see a phrase even I remember writing that I am a man we are mostly men Ah that's too touchy of a subject uh that's a whole nother thing but anyways I love these like beautiful phrases I love these beautiful phrases are you workshopping a couple right now you want to do a little live Workshop so one that has gotten shut down but I love it which is CTC confidential confidentiality transparency and commitment so CTC and and just you gotta see so you miss one meeting your band uh we've actually kicked three people out already because we've heard that they've communicated with Outsiders of like uh some confidential information but CTC is what I'm trying to which is what I'm trying to get stock make a thing yes it's not becoming a thing as of late but yeah well that's it that's the only one that's hard at work over there it's hard because this can't be rushed it's hard coming up with the phrase like what are these phrases what are some ones that you're inspired by so you said the I am one what are some other ones that you think are are well done well this other one is is they're calling it core which is like commitment openness uh respect and uh one other thing I don't know what the E stands for but core and core is not sticking with me but I'm I'm trying to be open-minded core's not sticking with me because four things to remember is a lot harder than more like values then it's not like you're uh it's like your values yeah it's values yeah your slogan so one thing I've been thinking about is no one uh nothing no one never where I was like that nothing no one ever never which is like is This Confidential nothing no one never dude like yes like everything everything it's nothing no one ever you can never talk about what's going on so I'm pulling around with nothing no one never I like that one yeah yeah yeah nice uh that one that one did a little something for me I like that yeah did it get you going it got me going uh what are some other interesting ones I there's not like that many that are intriguing to me to be honest but I'm I'm trying to figure out like how to do it it's really hard just creating that shift from scratch is way harder than it looks uh or I'm just not talented but like are there any good ones that you like you know the one thing I heard about like on the value side that always stuck with me was um a value is useless without acknowledging the trade-off so like you know most companies when they do their kind of like values they'll be like respect honor integrity which is stupid because like what's the opposite is that of course yeah like you said nothing that's of Interest you've acknowledged no like uh sacrifice in that you and it's just generic and so it's not memorable it's not memorable it's not useful because it's like um it's just an of course type of statement whereas uh you know Facebook did one that that stuck which was move fast and break things it's beautiful and move faster break things was so good and the reason why was because it acknowledged the downside of moving fast and sometimes you're going to break [ __ ] and like they said yeah yes we take that we will we'll err on the side of that we'll we will take that trade off and so um I think that values are only useful when you acknowledge when you when they bake into it the opinionated trade-off right like that the fact that yep there there are pros and cons to this and our opinion is that this is the pro that matters right um and and that we're down we we will live with this downside because that big because that's what shows you what you value like for example um if you're somebody who's really high integrity you're gonna um you're gonna let's say there's you know opportunity to take you're gonna not take you're gonna have to sacrifice things that could go your way because you're high integrity this is like Michelle Obama had one that that kind of was yeah it's gotta be like painfully truthful painfully true exactly so she did the when they go low we go high which is like kind of acknowledges that like you all they go low it hurts you want to hit them back but no we go high right when they go low we go hard that's another example of one that's like I like I don't know when she said that but that's like more than five years ago I still remember that a lot of people repeated that kind of like to make fun of her but it was politics people make fun of everything but like I do think there was something in that that was like more real than just like we stand for respect it's like Okay cool so it doesn't mean anything to anybody when you say that it's like we're all numb to those sorts of things like Subway eat fresh and we print grill marks onto our chicken because it's not really grilled like you know it's like all right well that's what they should really say it's like looks fresh but it ain't you know we uh my high school had a great one that I've always remembered it was meant for we were in all boys school and it was meant for others and they just did such a good job of like nailing that into our brains just you got to be a man for others there's like that's gonna be a dating app too yeah you're right uh uh so I remember meant for others I like that but it's been really challenging so I guess I gotta go find some more phrases um but but uh yeah I gotta I gotta I gotta make that better do you have any that you use for any of your companies you none of your was what was milk Rose did milk Road have one no but uh I don't think you need one at the beginning by the way at the beginning I don't think you need one I think you do need certain North Stars like you know you started the hustle you were like um we call it both [ __ ] free news yeah you were like this is like your no-nonsense or no [ __ ] your your smart friend telling you what happened in a no [ __ ] way that was a really good like North Star guiding principle that you could just say Okay cool so like we stole a version of that for the milk road because what would what ended up happening here's like a tactical way that that started to drift the top story in all the news news things would have been about like some arbitrary [ __ ] like some um maybe it was like a regulatory thing or maybe it was like like a kind of a boring regulatory thing or it was like some Layer Two blockchain on uh on like some layer 2 protocol on top of some like obscure blockchain did this thing and we would write about it and I would read it because at this point I was like you know I was like the editor it really never was the writer for milk Road um but I would read it and I would just call Ben and I'd be like dude what like are you interested in this he's like well not really but I mean they seem to be like I mean it's a top story by other news Alice I was like cool but like if you weren't into it like I was like here's the time would you text me about this like would you text me and tell me about this and would I be interested this is already baked into you wouldn't even text me if you didn't know if you you would only text me if you knew I'd be interested so I was like let's just use that as the test like the litmus test is basically would you text me about this thing that happened um if I was like yeah what's new in crypto right now like if that's not the thing then don't put it in the newsletter even if other people are writing about it and when we made that shift all of the like metrics kind of went up because people just naturally would resonate with that better because um we had like a guiding principle for what what goes in and what goes out and I think that's the other thing that goes that's really useful is um it's really easy to talk about what goes in what's important is to say what goes out and I do this with like strategy planning documents too like if I like I wrote up a strategy for our econ business I think everybody should do something like this by the way I wrote it down I wrote here's the six bets that we have made this year we're making this year and I write them down first so for example I wrote the things called Big bets and I share this document with everyone I said big bet number one was um we didn't have anybody in like demand planning or inventory forecasting I was like it's pretty stupid that we don't have everybody anybody doing this because of that I think we have a ton of waste and we're Miss like sometimes we're way under on products that people want sometimes we're way over and it just sits there and just ties up our cash I think that if we hire somebody who's got experience doing this we will get 20 30 Improvement on the bottom line literally just from that one Higher that's bet number one and then we hire that person now we're seeing how it plays out at number two was like that's smart um let's say like uh whatever without giving too much away let me say um like uh part like this this type of partnership we're trying to go for this type of partnership um with this other big entity we believe that if we do that it's going to have this effect that's the bet we're making we'll know if it's successful if x happens I just wrote that wrote this down and so the whole Strat company strategy for the year is one page long and it's just six like sentences it's like here's the situation here's the BET here's the situation here's the BET and I just wrote that out new and then with that at the bottom I wrote and here's the bets we are not making that we otherwise reasonably could have so for example we're not launching on Amazon because if you're because even though that would clearly add to the bottom line but if we're launching on Amazon that's gonna take resources away and see those other six bets that's going to take all of our attention this year so we're saying no to that we're saying no to this other thing we're saying no to this other thing all of which were totally reasonable you could make a case for but we decided not to do them because we don't want to spread ourselves too thin and it was actually that not doing section like the first part was useful but the second part was even more useful and I think that people should should highlight those like you know it's not focus is not what you say yes to focus is the 100 good ideas you say no to and so I think when you take that principle and you apply it that that's where you find the interesting stuff like whether it's in your company marketing or whatever what are you calling that in e-commerce Playbook oh I just like the bets like big bets that's what I call it like what are the big effects that we're making this year and we'll see it I wrote it I also wrote the top like we don't think that all of these are going to pan out the way we expect what are you right now I wrote one or two are going to either fail or we won't even execute on because one or two winners will suck up a bunch of our energy I expect that to happen I expect the middle for to work maybe you know plus or minus 20 on how well we think they should work so like some will slightly underperform our expectations some will slightly over perform one or two of the six bets will either fail completely or we won't execute well enough because our attention got sucked away by the other ones and one or two should have a huge payoff that's the distribution if we if they all just work as expected we didn't really bet wildly enough right so I kind of like the goals thing that you don't want to hit 100 of your goals you want to hit maybe like 70 of your goals that shows that you stretched far enough without overstretching I uh by the way speaking of the milk Road I had I forgot to ask you this so and uh right now so basically in 2017 I wrote this ad for the hustle and it was my boss thinks I'm smart parentheses I'm not it's because I read the hustle and he has no idea that it exists Dash a reader of the hustle and that was like our ad on Facebook on Twitter I see that ad everywhere for every newsletter for every like AI where it was like my boss thinks I know about AI I don't the reason I what happened is you did it morning Brew then did it so they called did they do it it's someone who's been running an ad like that for a long time um so you if you've seen those ads you're like oh good idea I'll copy that then the other thing was uh Facebook launched the ad Library so now you can go see other companies ads so you can just go and look what uh what ads are they running Google launched an ad Library Tick Tock now launched an ad Library so you can go see anyone's Tick Tock ads too then you've talked about that ad on the podcast and I noticed after the after you said on the podcast then people started running it then there's also a guy who worked for you who worked for up for us at milk Road who then goes in he's pitching up he's basically going and telling every newsletter company I'm the key to the growth of the hustle of milk Road of every [ __ ] newsletter company I did it I'm the best um I could tell you exactly what they did and um I don't know about you for the Hustle but for us I'm like this guy is massively overstating what he did but like whatever I mean I guess we were already in the we already had a million subscribers but yeah I mean and I didn't work closely with them but I I'm sure he's great I just uh we were okay but he is definitely overselling and he is people will come to me and they'll be like um hey I just wanted to get a quick reference check this guy basically like he does a presentation sales deck that just says like I did everything for milk Road like I I figured it all out I did all these things and like is that legit and I'm like no and actually the funny thing is I think in the short term that helped him as a long term that hurt him because two very big names have come to me and they said hey I'm thinking behind this guy sounds like he did great work for you guys just want to do a quick pulse check like um thumbs up thumbs down would you recommend and I was like I wish I could say yes but like no for these two reasons one he's overstating what he did if he just said what he did it would have been fine uh two when we sold the company he went and put up a Twitter thread saying like hey milk Road sold and here's all the things that they do to to grow and we asked somebody like hey man can you take that down like we're still running as a business like you can't just you shouldn't just like you're a you're a service provider you're you're a contractor for us yeah yeah we're a client of yours we never said and you want your confidentiality you should never go publish all of your clients things or even it's not actually all but like we don't want any of this stuff out there right and um and he's like no I gotta get mine too from the sale and I'm like what like dude I'm asking you to take this down are you really gonna like your client so it was never deleted and he was he tried to say no again and I was like wow like Jesus that is like insanely unprofessional to do that um in my opinion at least and uh you know so whatever he did delete it after that after I was like wow are you like are you serious this is actually the stance you're gonna take that's an insane stance to take yeah I don't like when people talk about two two really big names that I think would have been like way bigger than the hustle way bigger than milk Road we're gonna work with him have asked me and I'm like I can't I'm just gonna tell you what my experience was you decide and they're like oh no we would not want to work with somebody who does that and I was like damn like the short term that hurts leads to long-term loss unfortunately like you know that's the the irony of of doing stuff like that and I've done stuff like that too where I make a short-term short-term good decision that actually cost me in the long run but it's hard to see in the moment you know so it's it's yeah that's a that's a that's an expensive lesson but my question was were you running this ad and did it still work up until we sold it was still working we didn't run that ad we didn't run my boss things on whatever um we did I think try a version of like my friends think I'm uh you know like whatever my friends think I I know everything about crypto what they don't know is that I just read the milk wrote Every Morning um something like that I think we ran that but those weren't High perform like that wasn't the highest performer or other we had other stuff that was better performers but um that was our best one more than 50 of our subscribers were organic so it does like you know you you know the if more than 50 of your growth comes organic then that that means it's the content that's the content the brand dude I've talked to so many of these new newsletter guys and they're all doing so when we when we started the hustle like up into hundreds of thousands were organic and then we like learned I didn't know what paid marketing was then we learned about it and then we started doing this thing called co-registration which it would typically only scammy marketer type of people would do that like people selling like sex pills and [ __ ] and we were like well that's interesting like in theory let's actually figure out what it means in a non-schemy way and so we like well explain it so you go to a site so for example um you go to uh I'll try to find a real life example go to if you go to bold.org it's a website where you can apply uh you can enter in your information and it automatically applies you to tons and tons of different scholarships um and what it says was great if you want somehow they have a point system where it's like it's free to use but you have to sign up for like these newsletters in order to be able to um in order to be able to apply to even more scholarships and so we would pay bold.org some money I don't remember the money one dollar let's say for every college kid who entered their email and sent to the hustle and then they would go and subscribe to more stuff uh more scholarships and so that's what co-reges so you're registering for one thing but then you are asked to register for another thing in exchange for some type of perk typically that that's an internet marketing hack that's done with scammy stuff really scammy people but we went to product hunt and we were like hey have you guys thought about doing co-reg I'm like yeah we're working on it we're like well that would be great we would be your first customer and so that's how we started growing really quickly or we were already growing quickly but once you you know we're adding like we're adding like 5 000 people a day reinvent that every every stage right at the beginning you do friends friends and family then you do your own social media then you do uh posts that are really good content that's going to go viral that's gonna get you now to the next level of organic then you start layering on some paid then you have to diversify your paid because not one source is going to work as well as the others and they you know they don't all scale right and when you're adding a hundred thousand people a month you have like 50 or some amount is still organic but then that's still like 80 000 customers that you need to sign up so some will be Facebook some of this some that some co-reg So Co reg worked really well the problem with it is that it's a very low intent reader so like the scholarship person isn't like the highest is like hey Sean sign up for milk Road it's awesome that's high intent lesson less high but still high is like oh I saw this ad on Facebook saying there's this newsletter that sounds cool I'm interested the lowest intent is I'm trying to buy a uh I'm trying to get a coupon for Target but I have to get enter in the I have to get my email yeah in order that's the lowest intent or I'm trying to win this free prize and I get more entries if I just sign up for this [ __ ] newsletter whatever I'll sign up for it that's the lowest intent now I talk to well but that but the the thing is is that you grow quickly so for a quarter you can get an email subscriber but for every 10 email subscribers only one will actually be of high quality and so the problem is is you get addicted to this and so I was talking to all these other newsletter guys and they're like I got to 100 000 in like six months I'm like oh sick how they go oh this thing called Co reg and I'm like oh you're [ __ ] this is a horrible newsletter you're [ __ ] this is a your business is done by the way there's there's other versions of this so sub stack has a thing where you subscribe to someone substack and then they're like here's five other sub actually my like Auto checked and you're just you're just trying to continue and now you're subscribed to five newsletters and you see people whose curve on substack looks Flats up like you know normal growth normal good growth normal good growth and then like hockey stick it's like yes I crossed 300 000 500 000 subscribers it's like yeah but these aren't people who actually want to read your thing and then the other thing is that they think the open rate is high but open rates nowadays because of the way they've changed with apple cookie stuff works it's it's not reliable so for example yeah when we started 40 was good when we started 40 was good that was considered the best and then 50 we would get 50 and we were like we're the greatest there is now everyone is 50 right and because it's because they're not actually 50 it's because open rates cannot be measured the same way they used to be able to be measured where it was more more reliable now you have to use click-through rate or whatever uh like are people actually clicking your your ads your content that sort of thing and so uh this guy that I was talking I was talking about for the milk Road he was the one who's like oh yeah co-red who should do this we were like okay let's try it let's see how it goes we tried it sure enough sure enough you get you get good growth out of it but and you get addicted to it but it's the quality so after we sold we were like hey let's you know like at some point we were like okay let's look at all these sources we're getting this organic we're getting this from here this from here we did an analysis and we're like all right let's test this coverage thing the open rates look good let's just uh let's how do we figure out if these are high quality or not like I don't know open rates are good the cost is good should be fine right we sent him an email he said uh Hey just wanted to blah blah you know if if you read the milk grow do you like it like just respond with like whatever hello you know tell me where you're like hey you're a subscriber to the milk Road where do you live yeah we want to know where you live if somebody actually reads your daily newsletter 50 of the time they're so excited to get an email from the founder that says you know hey I'm just reached out to say whatever they'll give a very high reply rate guess how many replies we got I have no idea I think we literally got three replies out of how many cents there was maybe like I don't know I want to say like 20 000 or something like that like twenty thousand and three replied it was it was like a big number yeah I don't know the exact but like I know that the reply number was something like three replies that day maybe more trickled in but like it doesn't matter that day three people replied and we were like oh cut this off immediately um and that same guy goes and he peddles that to all the other newsletters it's like yeah this is what the hustle did this one velcro did it does it's like we did with a small percentage of what we were doing and as soon as we were able to test it we were like oh screw this why would we want a subscriber number like stupid somebody you don't want a subscriber number that's not real right like real subscribers the only way to build a real business and uh you know I talked to the morning Brew guys and I think they're they're also very like they I think just straight measure on like what does this lead to in terms of clicks on our ads yeah like or like conversions even you know from how many people buy our advertisers buying something right like if you because if I'm if I'm getting you as a customer that's the right way to do it right that's the sustainable way to do it but I don't think people you know kids these days they're doing it differently than than back in our day one one year ago yeah I remember way back then six months ago no that that's how they have to do it and they also um another thing is I talked to another guy and I was like well of your list how many if you said that you're hosting an AI event that was free uh how many people are gonna show up he's like oh we'd sell out immediately I'm like great then you're doing that that sounds like you're doing it correctly and then I talked to another guy I'm like well how many people would show up to this event and they're like well no one I'm like wow well then this this business sucks like they're they're not they're not real uh you should bail and quit uh or start over uh but yeah the co-reg thing it's mostly nonsense it doesn't always have to be or you could uh it's kind of a pain in the ass if you make money through advertising it's like you need to hit a Top Line number and that's why I hate advertising is because there's very there's inverse incentives so like not everyone's aligned with the same thing and so I think that's why I [ __ ] hate advertising uh it could be done well but when you have like a team to support and you want Katie to hit her quota and get paid I'm like ah [ __ ] you gotta like make sacrifices and I hate that but anyway I wanted to bring up this ad because we're talking about copywriting but it is what it is I can't find this client info have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform so it shares its data across every application every team can stay aligned no out of sync spreadsheets or dueling databases HubSpot grow better on Friday I interviewed Laird Hamilton how did it go so it went really bad uh it went very bad it went bad uh well he's not a business guy for one but I'm like a fitness I'm into fitness and stuff but I wanted to ask him all the fitness stuff but I was like I don't I watched so many hours of him leading up to it and I was like I don't want to just ask the same questions like I just watched so much of your stuff that all the questions that I thought I was going to have you've already answered them yeah you've answered it and so there was like that that there but also dude I just think it's a bummer to meet your Heroes because he's amazing but I just want him to be this like idea rather than this reality do you know what I mean I like I like him so like I remember like I I just I've been very lucky to meet a bunch of my heroes and once you meet them they're a little bit less of it here a hero and I think I just prefer them being a hero not to say that he didn't live up to my expectations he did it was just that uh I don't want to be even remotely appear of his I want him to be like you know right my great grandpa who I've read heard stories about if you're a fan of this podcast if you consider me a Sam you know somebody that you look up to in any way prepare to be disappointed all right we're just very average people when you meet us we will destroy we will ruin this podcast for you but I was super self-conscious about it so if you guys hear the Pod let me know like in the YouTube comments what you think but it was it was only okay I think it was maybe it was only okay for me as because I was in interviewing him but I just learned so much about him and I'm like oh I already know everything there's nothing new to know about you or I'm just not unique enough to ask a question you should have shifted gears and gone Bobby altaf on him what's that oh uh like that girl awkward interview girl and just act like you don't care she has shot up so basically I saw her on Tick Tock and I the thing about Tick Tock and Instagram is you don't know who else knows what you're watching right uh like it's hard like there's no like chart or there's no like Greatest Hits and so I was just like who is this random chick popping up uh is interviewing these these guys when she's like in her bed interviewing like Drake like not just like then I saw Drake and I'm like what the hell what is going on with this how is this like just this 21 year old woman who's like rude to her guest talking to Drake and then on the podcast charts I think she was number one for a few days yeah she's been in the top five she went from I've never heard of this person and she didn't have a podcast too a top five podcast in like two weeks so we're doing something wrong well yeah for sure she has this ad for seat geek sea geek advertised on her podcast with Drake and she was like so today's sponsor is sea geek which makes sense because Drake apparently hosts events and I think sea geek lets you buy tickets for events so if you like events and parade yeah yeah and she goes and they give you twenty dollars cool like that's her ad so the the call to action was the best she said something like she was like to go um you can use Street geek if you want I guess [Laughter] dude it's so funny she's pretty good I don't want to listen to 60 Minutes of that interview but like so she's interviewing Drake which is like I think her the first podcast that came out and she's like in the middle of it she's like I don't I don't know any other questions do you do you have any other questions and he's like uh not really like weren't they in bed under the covers during the interview yeah they're in a bed which is just I mean she's a genius clearly so she's a genius so I think her story is she was like a mom she was like a mommy tick tocker but I don't really understand how she went from Mommy tick tocker to podcaster interviewing Drake with like a really clear brand that's amazing like a very distinct Style that's amazing because if you watch her tick tocks she doesn't talk like that yeah it's just a character she's or she doesn't I mean it's not like I don't think her Tick Tock is mainly like that like I'm gonna put one up right now but like no some of it was it's like normal or her joking around with her friends but no it's it's like Stephen Colbert but instead of this conservative guy it's the I don't give a [ __ ] type of person so she uh I watched like an hour straight of one of these podcasts I rarely listened to like if you tell me hey there's a new podcast like I need 10 people to recommend a podcast before I go try it you know what I mean like it's not like an easy ask but um yeah I got hooked on her [ __ ] really quickly and watched a hour-long awkward interview with her and Mark Cuban and her with Rick Glassman I don't know if you saw this but she did one with Rick Glassman and it didn't seem like he was in on the joke I think he was actually the first one that she recorded Rick glassman's a comedian oh got it yeah yeah yeah he might have been another joke because he's like a very talented guy like he could he could find that line where it looks like he's not in on the joke but he is um but she was just like uh I mean she's just awkwardly interviewing him and he at some point he's just like what is like what is this why are you doing this and she's like why am I doing what I'm interviewing you and he's like no but you're he's like you're saying that you're interviewing me but everything I say you just say is a lie why would I lie why would I come to your podcast and lie and she's like I don't know why are you lying and then he's like he's like I'm not lying is this your bit is this what you do and he's like he just can't figure it out he's like I'm sorry I was frustrated and defensive because I felt like you were trolling me or something I didn't understand what was happening I still don't really understand what's happening but I'm gonna do better to try to answer your questions and she's like thank you you were being mean and he's like I wasn't being mean I was reacting I want to know what happens before and after the interview because after like so you and I have done some stuff in person with people and like you're really cool and friendly enough to people but I don't know what you do afterwards like particularly with like a Tucker Carlson interview where he's like getting mean with people and like you shake hands afterwards and say thanks for coming you know what I mean Lord or just like does it does it that was terrible thank you that was that yeah like oh we dislike each other strongly yeah so I'm curious to see what like the perform where she's like and seen and does she like be friendly and like give him a hug I I I don't I would like to see what that before and after is like yeah I I don't know she's a mystery to me somebody explained this to me I I just don't understand who she is how she landed such big guess why she immediately is so popular I mean like I get her brand but like how did she even break out that's kind of what I don't get um but whatever follow me all tough good good for you Bobby altaf 25 years old I think 20 25 26 years old and uh like clearly going to be one of the most famous podcasters all right yeah [ __ ] us yeah I mean that's the third time that's happened or the second time it happened with the caller daddy woman uh where like it was like episode two she shot up there that's pretty rare I mean it's more common with YouTube with podcasts that that doesn't happen often at all uh right now someone's gonna do that obnoxious tweet where it's like everybody thinks Bobby altoff is an overnight success here's how it was 10 years in the making and then it's just gonna be like you know some stupid origin story that like really wasn't like she actually is kind of an overnight success yeah which is cool I like should be some right there should be some people talk about like they don't exist I'm like well Instagram is only two years old I mean like those are real like it's real um which which one of these things you want to go to all right um dating so you and I both happily married off the daily Market but shit's getting crazy in the dating world I don't know if you've seen these two things I'm going to tell you about the first one is called chaos singles party have you ever heard of this no do you download the dating apps now just to like check it out and see what it's about if my wife asks this just just for science no no of course no I bought all these but I read this is the New York Times so um I heard I read this story in the New York Times and I was like what this sounds fascinating so here's the story this woman Cassidy Davis is on the dating app she's just a normal person um and it's Valentine's Day 2022 so last year Valentine's Day she's frustrating she doesn't doesn't have anything to do on Valentine's so she just basically she's like hey here's what's what we should do we should throw like a singles party on Valentine's Day so if you're single on Valentine's Day come to this she tells every one of her girlfriends who's also struggling with online dating hey match with someone on Tinder and then invite them to this party invite them to a house party and they're like what and she's like yeah just match with one person and invite them as your plus one to this house party but everybody's gonna do it so it would be just a bunch of single people at this party and she's like all right so they they try to do it she at the last minute is like I don't know if anyone's gonna come so she invites 65 guys from Tinder to be like come and they're like what is happening is this real are you like catfishing me she's like dude just get the Como don't come all right that's it and so she has this house party and you can see the video on her on her Tick Tock but it's like a very which city I'm not sure where this one was but it's a small it was like a small thing it looked like maybe there was like 20 people there but they were kind of having fun so it was like a bunch of single young people playing like drinking games whatever she records she makes a tick tock out of it stitches it together like just the highlights of the party basically posted on Tick Tock and says what she did she goes she's like I did the most chaotic thing possible for Valentine's Day I invited I told all my girlfriends to match with someone on Tinder and invite them to my house for this house party and it was awesome and then people that thing explodes that video gets like whatever tons of views and the concept people really like this concept and so she's like I'm gonna do another one so she posts an update she's like I'm gonna do another one in two or three weeks puts a link up for the chaos singles party same rules is it free um I think it might have been free or maybe there's a cover charge I'm not sure 500 people show up to that one and since then for the last year and a half of This Woman's life she's just been going on the road traveling City to City she partnered up with Tinder they like promote this thing now in the app they'll even promote her her parties um and she gets paid to basically host these things and now 200 300 people a night come to these singles parties same rules match with one that's your plus one come to this event you can mix and mingle you can you can stick with the person you invited or just whatever it's all just people on Tinder who want to like have this chaos singles party I love this idea this is awesome I'm looking at her Tick Tock now so well done by her and now these things are like big like they're they're partnering with like legit venues it like looks like a lot of fun it looks like a whole whole scene now this is awesome I'm looking at her Tic Tac This Woman's talented did I tell you about the or did you ever see the Twitter things that I used to do for dating sometimes yeah those were great it was they were great my friend right it was basically like it was Thanksgiving and uh we were having friends over and some of them are single and I'm like they were like hey can you post me on your Twitter I want uh they asked or you said it because that's a crazy ass one of the people made a joke they're like dude just post me on your Twitter I need to meet a guy or someone it was like one of Sarah's friends was like I need to meet a nice a nice guy who's successful can you like introduce me I was like I'm just gonna post you on Twitter and then I was like well I don't want to make you the only person like I'm your pimp so I'm gonna get 10 friends and the Twitter said the Tweet said um um hope you're hungry on Thanksgiving Day uh you know like here's 10 people 10 of my buds yeah I was like hope you're hungry meet my friend Jesse yeah here's 10 here's 10 of my friends who are single and I said like a little bit about what they do for work and just I just went on their Instagram and took a picture and um it got viewed like two million times and I got dm'd by a lot of Brands like hey you want to make this a thing we'll sponsor it I was like no that's not gonna be my thing I don't want that no I was just [ __ ] around and I think that that could potentially work like we actually turned it into like a uh like where it's like an affluent crowd dating app or something like that I think I I did it with Jonathan and Jonathan actually met a girl who he went out with I think like a handful of times like so for Jonathan I think it was successful is this true what happened after you got posted on this thing well one of the girls who applied uh shout out to Connor Anne she came to the uh South by Meetup that we did so I got to meet her there hung out a little bit um but in terms of like my DMs like I got hit up by a gay dude and this nice Indian woman who I um decided not to reply super successful yeah but for her and for for the women I'm sure it crushed are you still seeing that girl Connor are you guys just buddies now um nah not really she lives in Florida so but it kind of worked yeah we're grasping for straws I mean pretty successful sounds like these gorilla things I love by the way I love these like gorilla gorilla dating yes so here's another one date me docs have you have you heard about this trend so it's date me dot directory is that the URL that's the that's the directory of them but date me docs is like basically you take instead of going on a dating app you created a Google doc and you just write in long form all about you your story what you want who you are what you're into what you're not into where your boundaries are all that stuff you just make a very detailed Google doc and that's your profile and then somebody created the directory that links all the people like it's like an air table table so it'd be like you know here's you know um Christina she's a female she's interested in men she's age 42 and it's just literally an air table and um dude they're all Sally they put mono and Polly they're like it looks like almost half of them are poly yeah I mean they want to have an open relationship or they're not serious kids these days don't I think it's like oh I think they want to like be dating a bunch of people at once or something I think it's like half of them are poly that's wild to me yeah yeah that's I think um you know that's that's something that's changed I think since we were like when I was dating 10 years ago I never met anybody who was like you know I'm polyamorous yeah the only people who did that are like are like um it's like a guy who's got like 10 wives and it's on the TLC Channel it comes on after John and Kate Plus Eight yeah yeah this is uh I think that's new so anyways the these docs if you look at these click click into some of these docs they put your photos and stuff and like a huge bio this is wild I click this one uh that's by Misha it's the fourth one down so Misha is a male and it takes two to a website that there's just like these like torches like you're entering a dungeon probably not the vibe Misha that you want but here we go and then the title is just romance hi I'm currently single looking for a primary partner hot that's hot how you said that primary partner like that um only been in other relationships just bought a house blah blah blah um and then it's like here's a bunch of my favorite blog posts here's some of my first dates you can chat with me on Discord here's my Spotify here's some pictures of me a bunch of pictures boom boom boom all right so that's that's Bishop but like one of the things I noticed I clicked through a bunch of these is how intellectual all of these are so they'll be like you know things you don't normally put on a dating profile it'd be like like here's one I'm on This Woman's uh page uh srida she says um I'm not ideologically monogamous meaning I don't think monogamy is innately superior to polyamory I hold romantic feelings for more than one person at once but also struggle with jealousy blah blah it's like very it's like is this therapy what is this this is like a whole like open book style of letting somebody into your brain which I can definitely see working for some people and I can see it totally not working for a type for the type of person who they don't want out so I actually think this is a really great idea because I think it attracts in a lot of the same type of person the kind of like a little bit overly intellectual very open-minded type of crowd that would be attractive you know it's kind of tech tech focused uh crowd here oh my gosh this is wild smiling it was just literally he's looking at a screen and he's just smirking I'm looking at a lot of this uh it's there's one guy he's got a 15 page user manual any like documents his whole life to explain how to like and he talks about like ethical stuff he's like the correct answer to the trolley problem is to kill one person to save five like he like there is a correct like this is wild and on some regard I'm like well if you're like a single woman who's like 30 and you're like look I just need to meet like a competent man who's like thoughtful I guess this is the way to go unfortunately these aren't the type of guys that typically like can woo a woman I'm on a dock right now and it just there's a whole sub subsection called child rearing plans and then it's 17 paragraphs of their plans for child rearing this is pre-first date which is kind of amazing so have you heard of um this reminds me of two things one if you uh there's this guy named Christian uh Rudder I think his name is he founded OkCupid he was one of the three or four co-founders and he had a Blog on all the data that OkCupid had and so and then eventually turned it into a book and the thing was basically like you say one thing but your actions on our dating app say another thing like you say you want x y and z and I think one of the big takeaways was you say you want this this and this you really just go after people's photos so like you say you don't want to you you say you don't want a smoker but if they're hot enough you'll you'll go with a smoker you say you don't want an animal lover but if they like fit your like your physical wants you're gonna You're Gonna Wanna be with them and like that always intrigued me and that's why I don't think some of these like long-form things will actually work I think they want it to work but it won't the other thing is have you heard about the league do you remember the dating app the league yeah she came on the Pod once yeah her name is Amanda Bradford she's a buddy of mine she sold the lead you know they sold the league I didn't know this all day so they sold it yes I believe it was a very good sale they sold it to match I think match.com or one of the big ones and I asked why they bought it and she was like well basically we only had like five or ten employees or something at the league it was a really small team but the league originally I don't know if it started out as the phrase ivy league but it was basically like high-end to meet a high-end partner and you had to like apply and stuff like that and she was like one day I just said I went to she's a developer um and she goes I logged into like our our app store account and I was like we're charging 20 bucks a month right now how high does the App Store let me charge like what's the highest amount for subscription revenue and I think I think it was like 99 a week she's like that's the highest I go [ __ ] it that's what we're gonna do we're just gonna do 99 a week and she was like everyone at my company and everyone outside said it's not gonna work she's like it crushed it we our Revenue went up like crazy and one of the biggest reasons why match bought us is they're like we need to figure out how to sell products that are hundreds of dollars a month and no one knows how and she's like oh I'll teach you how all you do is you go to your the App Store and you just delete the number that you put in and you just put the higher number and guess what people are still gonna do it and that was like her thing was that it was a really really expensive dating app and it totally worked uh for for higher end people and so I still think that could be cool what you and I didn't have when we were younger when we were dating we probably wouldn't have qualified then and we are and unfortunately we're not uh we can't use it now but basically have you heard of Raya yeah it's like a celebrity it's like you gotta be hot and famous to be in or something like that yeah I think they just look at your Instagram like if you're verified on Instagram you're allowed to do it so Raya is like everyone who's single is like saying like oh of course we know all about it but Raya is cool but I like these uh like exclusive dating apps and these expensive ones I think it's way better I've Got Friends that run uh Tinder competitors and it sounds like a horrible business it's one of the very few businesses where you can't be like number three or number four like there's basically number one and number two and that's it at least that's what it appears like if you're going for Mass Market what's the quotes like you know I don't want to be a part of any club that will have me as a member that's that's sort of what you want when it comes to dating or cool things um you know this date me docs thing I think is a really fun idea I'm glad uh whoever I don't know who created this but kind of kind of like a cool cool idea and obviously like things like this have been around for a long time right like Indian people famously like this is how my parents got married for example you write in the newspaper like you're you're like bio data it's like your your name your age your job your whatever and you just create this profile that's like text only and people are like cool married let's do it and um you know that's basically how things how things work so you know stuff like this actually can work the funny thing is um this is actually you know what I'm gonna actually do I'm actually just gonna recruit on here I think this is a great recruiting platform I think these people are probably all really smart thoughtful individuals who are tech savvy a lot of developers on here they put their GitHub profile yeah [ __ ] LinkedIn I'm just I'm scraping this for leads to hire from this is amazing uh uh dude this one guy on here says 16 years old that's a trap Jack I'm not clicking back I've seen way too many episodes of Chris Hanson I'm not clicking that I know straight to the FBI website bro the next phrase here is uh come on Folsom Prison yeah dude my first one of my first internet companies was called bunk and the premise was we would put these ads we would uh so close to the next Airbnb well it should have been Airbnb and it should have been just Tinder for Tinder but it basically the way it started was we would go and find online three and four bedroom apartments and we would like if it was a four bedroom apartment for four grand we would say we have one bedroom available for one thousand dollars and we would get 500 people to apply and then we would host a party and team up people to get that place as well as a bunch of other places because we're like oh you guys are all looking for similar budgets apparently so just like come and team up and get your own apartment and uh it worked it worked quite well and then a bunch of the people at the party started like hooking up with each other and we didn't catch the clue that we should have just made this a dating thing and then we launched this app we called it roommates and it was basically Tinder for roommates and again we didn't catch the clue that people like I actually met a girl two different girls on that app uh that I ended up dating in 2013 or 14. and again we didn't catch the clue we should have just done this for dating it would have worked a lot better yeah the dating game is changing you know one thing that dating is always going to be a problem like it will never not be a pain point for people like No And there's no such thing as sort of like solving dating and anytime one thing gets popular it creates the need for another so like you know Tinder created the need for something like hinge and now when you have sort of like the Tinder and hinge generation I talk to people who are dating now and they're like oh you know what the two worst things about those PL like about Tinder and hinge is like you get either on Tinder you just get bots like business is just girls trying to get you to like subscribe to their only fans like oh this really hot girl match with me and she's interested in me she tells me to just click this link and then like follow the oh man this is just an upsell like there's a bot it just upselling me basically the other one is people that um uh like because like we did we were joking about the poly thing but like people have a lot of different like I don't know preferences and kind of different situations there's like a lot more configurations than like a boy who likes girls I'm a boy who likes boys right like that's kind of what we knew was like you know we were Checkers not chess when it came to dating right there was only so many moves you could make you could move forward and backwards that was it and so here you're red or black that's that's the game yeah now it's like you know multi-colored chess and so the the way that uh my friend was telling me he's like oh there's this one app I think it was called field or something like that maybe I got that wrong but I think it's called field he's like I like it because people just super straight up it's like the culture on that app is gonna be ultra direct it's like I am looking for and you say the exact thing you're looking for what you're into and what you're not into so that like people know like they're not going to get meet somebody oh this person's really cool but they want a completely different type of relationship configuration gender configuration that I'm into and so uh so I think you know there's there's always a new need you know how when you and I do meetups and every once in a while a line will form to like say hi it's like hey how are you uh I was joking with my friend and she's like you know that's what it feels like to be a hot chick all the time but like like you know like when you and I will have like an MFM Meetup and we walk in you'll see like oh people like are staring at us like this guy's giving me energy like he wants to like me to open I'll turn my hips a little bit and let him like give them like the the you know like Alex open my hip that's what it is it's like whenever you point your junk it's like you know be out of fig and you're like one-on-one with this other guy but you feel this it's all dudes and you feel this other loose energy you feel this other guy hovering you're like all right I'll turn my hips a little so this guy could get in on the combo and uh that's basically what it feels like to be like a a six out of ten woman like all the time or maybe even lower like just to be a woman all the time just you just whatever you want it's yours dude this last thing of this do you remember like when I was in college the the game was like you would go to a bar or club or whatever and literally it was like a physical version of Tinder it was like you just go your guys just go behind a girl and just grind and if the girl like accepts the grind then then you're you're in it they don't it's like National Geography it's like National Geographic man you're like a bird reflecting its feathers the craziest that's the craziest thing that used to be normal I don't know if that's still normal that's the craziest thing that like I experienced in my life did you do that I never did that that was so uncomfortable dude that was all anybody around me even knew like this junk oh yeah no not a chance I was too uncomfortable for that you had a question on here that I actually was thinking about the other day you have a question on here and I I originally thought I wrote this but I guess you did where it's what's an example of things today that our grandkids in 50 years will think is absolutely insane I've been thinking about this because on Tick Tock and Instagram the kid's binding is my example grinding at the club is my first example I don't know if they do that anymore or not but it didn't even take 50 years it took me 15 and I already realized that was batshit crazy then well you'll see these videos and they'll be of high school so like the kids now will be like check this out this is a home video of the class of 2008 in high school and you like see them walking around and like you see like the the stuff that we used to wear and you see like our razor flip phones and then like the kids reminisce like I can't believe they did this or that was so much better this was so much worse you had a cool question on here about what do you think will be crazy yeah I think about this a lot what are things that 50 years from now like our grandkids will look at the way we live today it'd be like what the hell were you thinking right like um you know there's past example like if you go way past it's like slavery wow I can't believe that was just like the way you guys did things or whatever right like you know riding horseback that's crazy that's how people got around or just like people just dying of like everything you know like early on early age like that's crazy that was so risky to have a kid like you know one out of what four or five kids would just die before they even hit ten like that's that's really really rough I was reading this Lewis and Clark book and whenever they get sick on the trail they like give each other pills and they're like we're just gonna give you diarrhea and you're gonna [ __ ] out the sickness they call it a rush pill they go we're gonna give you these pills and you're gonna get tons of diarrhea and you're gonna be healed and that was like the thing it was just we're just gonna make you poop a ton yeah yeah we did that with four Loco it was great it just changes shape all right so so you had you wrote someone here of more recent history so he said driving to places without Google Maps yeah I like these are things that we experienced the before and after right like we're at that age where we experience the paper map era the asking people for directions era just knowing how the interstate system of the United States works like my dad just kind of knew roughly what you do to Google Maps dude I don't even know the highway I live in Austin I don't even know the highway the big Highway one mile away I can't even tell you the name of it same I don't even look up go by field all right then you had landlines versus Cell like landlines being the only way to contact someone versus cell phones we we both experienced that um you wrote unsafe cars what do you mean by unsafe cars dude my first car was in 1992 Mazda Protege and we bought it for I got it for 900 for my mailman and when you look at that yeah but I know you're like I'll tell you well sometimes uh we'd have to wear we'd have to wear Ties on uh we'd have to wear ties to school every once in a while and if like my dad went to work too early and he wasn't there my mailman would tie my tie so like I got to know the mailman a little bit kind of weird bought it from bought my car from it for 900 and if you see that car to a new brand new like Honda Civic if you ever watch the videos of them running into each other it's insane it's absolutely insane like the safety it's pretty wild how dangerous they are so yeah I think like these like uh when we look at cars uh when I look at cars from like the 80s and 90s it's ridiculous how shitty they are yeah that's crazy um so what are the ones that you think 50 years from now so we got a couple on here let's just go back and forth you do one I'll do one the first one is having and I've said this for a while but having like a growth on you having something growing in your body that's gonna kill you that you could have figured out had you just gotten some type of scan a year earlier so I think that's gonna we're gonna look back and like dude so you just had this thing in your body and you didn't even know it'll be like so how well how did you know it's like well if you if you would feel a lump then you would just go to the doctors like feel Olympia like if there's like a golf ball in you that's new all right let me go get it checked out that's literally state of the art like I just described state-of-the-art procedure and half the time you're like yeah [ __ ] it'll go away you know what I mean maybe it was that burger right earlier yeah go away it's probably a lipoma it'll go away and so yeah I think that will be a thing how about yours um okay easy one I'll start easy mode driving yourself like it's pretty clear self-driving cars are like on the horizon the idea that like yeah back in my day we used to get a license when we were 16 years old and then yeah I just used to drive I used to just hold there we used to have a steering wheel in the car and you just have to look where you're going and all the other cars were also holding steering wheels looking where they were going we tried not to crash and if you're on a two-lane road it's 80 miles an hour the opposite way with three feet of distance yeah yeah you just well they painted these lines you just had to stay in the middle and you just had to keep awake and stay in the middle let's keep looking and they'll be like what like that will sound completely barbaric right like um it's like did people not crash yeah they sure did that yeah some people get drunk before they did it like it'll sound just like what were you guys thinking well we just didn't have the tag at the time but like when you have self-driving cars cars are going to drive perfectly without you needing there won't even be a steering wheel in the car cars will become like entertainment pods you'll just play video games or you'll sleep or you'll watch movies or you'll work like cars will become a whole different thing very soon and there's a clear before and after another one is so different diets like we still debate we're like the Atkins diet that's a thing oh no no you want to do the other thing where you got to eat lots of carbs you know car whole grains that's that's what you have to do and to this day like we're like well which one do you feel good on I don't know like just do whatever I have alternated carnivore and vegan twice yeah you are vegan to your you will only consume vegans it's just constantly changed and like we don't know which one necessarily is better you know there's like really good Arguments for both and we aren't sure and I think that that's pretty insane that uh who knows you know I don't know right by the way have you ever do you know a lot of doctors do you know how many classes they take on nutrition typically it's like it's like a class like they don't doctors don't study nutrition which is pretty insane uh or at least like your average like or exercise yeah your average doctor doesn't exactly it doesn't really know too much about exercise or nutrition and so I think that that's like something we're gonna be like I don't know you just kind of like tried a bunch of different stuff and like you would read a bunch of blog posts on it and listen to podcasts and like you just kind of guessed a little bit right I think eating meat so killing animals to eat their meat I think we'll be seen like a genocide like a slavery I think it will be seen as completely barbaric and immoral 50 years from now when we have the alternative there will be an alternative which is basically lab-grown meat or synthetic food that will solve the kind of protein problems and taste get the taste right um and the cost right and at that when that happens as that shift happens we'll just be like yeah people just you just take the thing you Slaughter it you just kill it and then you eat it and then be like you do it yourself like no no gross I would never do that they do it and then they package it and then we read it and they're like what like didn't you have a dog it's like yeah I would never do that to a dog it's like but you would do it to this other animal I was like yeah I was like how did you guys decide it's like well I guess I'm a cuteness or like I don't know I don't know how we decided what was completely illegal and immoral and would get you canceled versus like you eat it two times a day like you know the line is very thin between like cow and chicken and dog right like it's not that it's not that clear why one yes first the other no um so I think that eating meat will become will be seen as as basically like Our Generations we just committed genocide on animals I have 20 cows at my Ranch you knew that right that have cows out there they're not yours right they're just straight or they're yours they're my neighbor their my neighbor owns them and they are allowed to use my land to graze and I don't pay taxes because of that or I pay less taxes but basically uh you I get to know them so like I know who they are like I know which ones are which I know whose mom is who and like it [ __ ] sucked our first week there that we bought the place uh like a four month year old calf died or it was but a four-month-old calf is still like 600 pounds or whatever it was it was like a 600 pound baby and apparently it like swallowed a golf ball so my neighbor was like hey were you hitting golf balls I was like no dude I was like I just I just moved here and it wasn't me I don't know um on Instagram yeah and I was like dude once you get to know me you'll you'll we'll understand neither of us to golfer I'm not a golfer you know what I mean and so and then I was like hey uh Jeff this guy was I was like what do I go and get like a shovel or something he goes oh no that some [ __ ] is going to be gone in three days he's like what do you mean he goes you'll see and so I come back in three days and the whole body and carcass everything was gone the all the animals like the birds and Hogs they just ate it it was completely gone and the mother would go back to the spot where that calf was and would like mourn and I was like my heart was broken I was like I don't know if I could eat meat in the same way now so I felt like devastated and so since then I basically I only eat red meat like once I'm month because the cow is like I get to know them and I'm like I feel too sad I can't do it I'm not I'm not I'm not that manly of a man I can't do it but you you think that child birthing manually is gonna be a thing of the past yeah so uh when I was in LA we had dinner with a person named Jessica Ma you know she is yeah she's uh she's very impressive she's super impressive I think she did a company called in dinero I don't know her very well she's at this dinner but she was on the other side table so I didn't get to know her too much but uh she seemed very interesting like in dinero was like an accounting company that's still very successful but I think it's so successful now that she just has tons of money and does more stuff yeah it's a big one I think she's she's out of that business now from what it sounded like um and we were like what do you do and she's like oh I basically invest and incubate like uh like hard science businesses and I think she's still only like 29. yeah yeah it was she was very very impressive sometimes you could just tell that people are playing a different game at a different level so there's like yeah same game different level different game same level and then there's different game different level I would put her in different game different levels yeah you could talk to her she's pretty brilliant I'm within five minutes you're like oh okay I think she was I think her she started in dinero an accounting software company at 19. I don't know much about her but she started her I just went to her LinkedIn by the way uh started her first six figure business when she was in Middle School goddamn different game different level okay yeah I was I hadn't even grinded yet yeah that's crazy um anyways so she's she's doing this thing um one of the things we said we were talking to her but we were like what are some of the crazy science things that you're funding and then she would say things that were like her thing was like novel like she's trying to find like a novel approach at like an existing thing I don't want to butcher it but something like that which basically like what you called a bold a bold uh bold science so it's like basically like someone taking a new scientific Approach at an existing problem so she'll go to universities and she'll find um research Labs where they'll be like this is the one researcher who's trying to do this thing but this like completely other way than the general field is going and she's like cool I want to fund that because those bold approaches when they work work in a really big way and um so one of the things we talked about just somehow in the conversation came up was like uh like birthing a child is like the natural way or whatever like you know a woman carries baby nine months it goes into labor delivers baby um you know dad Snips the umbilical cord like that's the the process as we know it today wait does the dad do it they they hear like Dad you want to do it you gotta be ready is that whatever be offered I'm not doing that on them in the moment they're like Dad come do this and you're gonna be like what no I'm good I'm I'm holding her hand over here I'm I'm busy and they'll be like no no come come do it and then you're gonna be like oh and you're gonna hold the thing and be like I don't want to hurt this is gonna hurt what is this yeah I'm not doing that man I don't even want to I won't even trim our toenails I'm not gonna touch that I don't want to touch that thing you're did you do it I did it yeah oh man I don't the peer pressure of six doctors and your wife who just like did a modern Miracle did a like act of human bravery and courage and then you're like I don't feel comfortable doing this like dude I am not doing that wimp of the year like I've already told my wife I think I'm gonna pass out I'm thinking a couple Xanaxes in in the room I I this is on no that's too much for me man I don't know if I can do that I'm I'm not one of that guys I'm not that guy I don't think my brother-in-law with my sister was uh you haven't given having birth giving birth whatever yeah she he like yawned at some point are you tired he was like no sorry he's like no it's just boring yeah it is honestly kind of boring um but yeah anyways yeah you better be prepared you're gonna have to do it um so anyways birthing a child so she was like yeah I think that's gonna be seen as like unnecessary sort of barbaric um not like as like um scientifically sound as like eventually we'll be able to kind of like almost like incubate the baby um and just like deliver the baby through like essentially a machine that the a baby will be sort of like grown and delivered that way have you met someone who's had a surrogate yeah many people haven't had surrogate yeah I have and they've acknowledge that they don't feel they didn't love the kid the same as the other one pretty first of all did you ask of course I asked of Cora is that not the that's not that's obviously the first thing you're gonna ask when you hear about it well there's like a there's like a handful of questions there's a handful of questions which is a like obviously how much does that cost uh you're gonna run yet yeah other women yeah where'd you find them uh and then like what did you do like what was the relationship like and then like my fourth question is like did they ever try to hold the baby hostage dude I could still imagine you being the worst possible surrogate because you would micromanage their lifestyle like it's my baby in there yeah you better you better get up here on this treadmill but the surrogate can basically hold you hostage right because you'll do anything you'll do like well yeah whatever you want like I'm I I have to give you what you want because I will do anything for that kid but then the last the fifth question was like all right but like did you love the kid as much as the other ones and the answer was at first no definitely not I definitely didn't uh they got honest with me and I so I don't know if I believe this is gonna be a thing um but yeah I feel like if there's the option it's kind of like the epidural um like so I think when we were in the hospital so my wife's insane and wants to only do natural birth and like feel all the pain for no reason but she's like you know she's like that's how I get down I'm like oh wow oh my God or so I guess opposites I've taken the light version you [Laughter] got any leftovers I'll take it but the doctor had said 90 she's like 85 to 90 of the patients in their hospital do the epidural because like you know it makes sense like if you can you know not feel that level of pain it's it's easy to see why somebody would choose that so um you know if you just sort of extrapolate from there you're like cool would you like to also not have the nine months of pregnancy like going on in your body um if there was that option like you really think people wouldn't take it I think people would take it yeah I think some people would I just don't I don't know if it's look at the ozempic thing dude if you give people the magic pill the way out like people take that [ __ ] like if you get the cost right that's a good point I do love people are going to avoid pain right they're going to avoid discomfort and pain where they can I order doordash three times a day like you think that people aren't gonna do this they're gonna yeah you're right actually I love magic pills whenever I hear someone that's who's selling like a magical cure or a magic pill I'm I'm in probably won't work but tell me everything oh zepik is a little bit of a magic pill when I when I was taking it it was quite magical did you take it no no I haven't taken it you should it's awesome I guess I'm also kind of crazy in that way where I'm like well then it wouldn't be as satisfying like I want to do this on my own yeah yeah but having ABS is pretty sick so totally agree two or three failed diets away from from breaking and going on this epic um um all right what else we got that's all I got yeah that's it all right we're out of here Sam hit him with the line that is the pod [Music] foreign

if you guys look at the Google trends for Threads it's not looking good I didn't have a lot of faith in it I saw a lot of people talking about that and I think their takeaway is like oh it's not working or it failed but like I see that and I'm like that was gonna happen either way there was no chance that 100 million people are gonna download it and 100 million people are going to keep using it next week no app in the history of mankind ever has worked that way but the question is like what happened three months from now once they get their kind of core base of users does that start growing or not

a full-time position if you're an amateur you've never done this before you maybe you'll get notice but you have to be really good we're not looking for people who are trying to take a huge risk on we're trying to find people who are the best uh we've already had hundreds of people apply so we really want the best people out there if you've never done this before you could still throw your throw your your resume out there and try to impress us but make sure you do that um if you've already been there done that that that's awesome too so check it out email Shan Shan sha.com all right let's get to the Pod all right get ready the greatest show I've ever done a lot of people have uh we got a lot of good comments on the last show people were saying someone asked me an interesting question they go your guys's Cadence is really good you guys uh you talk really fast and it feels quickly and then someone said do you do something to one another because we're Sean and I are remote do you do something to one another to let each other know that it's your turn to speak and I was thinking I think we just have we just know each other well enough that we know how to do it but there is something that we each do at least Le I pay really attention to you when you do it and I try to give you the signal which is you open up your mouth when you want to say something and then you let it sit open for a minute do you know what I mean it's the zoom hack because you're like you're like uh and the little uh is without the without the sound is basically just set lightting down but you know cuz on the recording you're not going to see it so it's a silent signal whereas if you were doing that in person it'd be a little like strange um but yeah it definitely works the hard one is during interviews because during interviews the guest is talking we don't know when they're going to stop they're opening up like probably a bunch of like paths you could go down like they mentioned three things they said it was really hard then they said they met a guy who who was the guy and they said that it really changed the perspective but how what did it change and so you're like and then we don't know who's GNA go we're both pretty insatiably curious I have a bad habit of just like talking too much in general in life and so then it's like we don't know which path we're going to go and we don't know who's going to decide um so A Team interview I think is really hard uh it's it's very that's very hard the interviews are easier in person but what we do this now with just us I think it's way easier on Zoom because I've gotten so used to it also I've recorded in studios like you have done lately you're going to talk about your trip in La I cannot stand when there's a third party there because I'm constantly trying to entertain her or him like the like the person there but uh yeah we it what people don't see is we do a good job of opening our mouths just a little bit so the other person knows when it's done pro tips for everybody yeah that's what you learn after three years of uh intense podcasting one of the top Rak business podcasts in the world you don't get these kind of insights anywhere else oh my God someone was like you guys are so fast-paced I'm like yeah it wears me out I usually always to take like a 20 or 30 minute nap I just close my eyes and lay down on this couch that guy's definitely just listening to us on 2X and he's like wow these guys are strange you know he let us know he hit the button on his app uh so you just went to LA last episode I asked you about it you said I'm going to do a whole thing where I tell you about it I love these things because you're very observant you uh you you are you have great observations and you don't never leave your house so when you do you're extra you're e you have great observations Boy Meets World and the the thing about you is you've got like a child's likee awe of the world because like you're so sheltered and you live in such a bubble and so you say these things that I'm used to but I love just hearing it anyway a Sam far back ended compliment one of the finest uh yes all those things are true there used to be a website back in the day I don't know if you remember I don't know if it's still up probably is uh little big details did you ever see this website no and it's a great little blog it's a Tumblr blog actually that's like tumblr's not even around anymore but what they did post 2017 they would just it was like a swipe file so they would just capture any example of like a small thing that a company did well so um like on a Google doc it on a Google doc when you go to share it and you don't name it it just takes the first line of what you spoke about and it makes that the title of the Google Doc as opposed to just naming it Untitled document yeah exactly or like it says on Google if you Google the word kerning every word that shows up in the results has a large amount of kerning right like the the font um or it'll be like you know the error like the 404 page of this site instead of just saying error has this really fun um [ __ ] poem or whatever it is and so uh I love this website I love the name little big details um I love this site because it just gave me a bunch of inspiration when back in the day when I was like more of like a PM product designer type guy um but third little big details are the secret of life right I've said this before it's the moments in between the moments like it's not the big moments that matter it's the moments in between those moments that matter this is the product version of that it's like here's the little things I remember the first time I used SL and our designer typed a hex code they were like oh yeah it's going to be color you know number 88 3344 F and then it just it automatically swapped that to the color swatch so we could see it it added the color swatch to it in line right and we were just like what the like it was a mic drop moment and our and our every like our design team was like okay I [ __ ] with this product like they like somewhere in this a designer was like you know it' be cool it'd be cool if you could actually see the preview of this thing because nobody knows what these numbers mean and like I don't even know how they did it with the Emojis size thing and it was just like a little big detail and there was a bunch of those with a great with great products like slack um that that kind of like I we were in the first hundred users of slack or something and so it was very clear that like this thing might become a thing because the care that they took to this so anyways the things I want to talk about the LA trip they're not the big moments it's not oh I met with this famous person and here's the the groundbreaking Insight I tried to find a bunch of the little big details a bunch of moments in between the moments that I think were interesting in their own way this is for two reasons one I don't really want to brag or I can't really talk too much about the people I met and what they said because it'd be kind of airing out you know those private meetings but two I think there's just a lot of interesting stuff in these or at least I think there could be so I wrote down a bunch of very vague but slightly intriguing bullet points and you can pick but I will say here's the structure so I go to LA with Ben business partner Ben um we do three things so we uh here's the daily schedule morning is basically meetings in a workout that was the goal um midday was typically recording a podcast live in person with someone that we admired respected or thought was really cool and then the evening was always a dinner with kind of like founder friends who were almost always people who had sold their companies sold one or more companies uh in the past and and we did that for 5 days straight so we would leave the house at 8:00 a.m. we would get back around midnight and crash and then do it all again the next day oh my God and uh for me who's someone who's almost always at home on I have two little kids that are under the age of you know four years old so uh you know I'm on a kid schedule typically this was crazy but um was was an awesome was an awesome experience so now take it away all right so you have a list of maybe 20 things I bolded about half of them that in intrigued me I want to learn about big company CEOs talking about laundry mats all right so this is the story we're out at um one of the kind of like after dinner just like let's go hang at this other place so we're hanging at this other place and it's me it's business partner Ben and it's our buddy suly and we're hanging out and um Ben goes hey that's so and so and we look across I'm like I don't even I don't recognize the name or the face so I'm like what are you talking about he's like we did a call with him two years ago and I was like what he's like yeah we did a zoom call for like 20 minutes with that guy he intro us to this guy other guy and I was like I don't I mean I can't for the life of me remember this guy's face and this guy by the way doesn't remember us either right like he doesn't recognize us either Ben uh he's got like freaking the like you know how China has the facial recognition software that there running at all times using AI Ben Ben has that uh this happen like five or six times during the trip he would see someone walking by and be like that's that girl from Twitter i' be like what how do you know this and so he does it he's like hey blah blah blah and they're like surprised he's like hey it's Ben we talked two years ago on a zoom call for 20 minutes and he's like you see the guy kind of like doesn't really know what's going on they're having dinner so we merge dinners wait did you really yeah we just merg Hangouts their crew was awesome so they're they're best friends from business school they went to Harvard Business School together one of them runs one of them is now CEO of a public company can't say which one but he's uh such a funny guy so assuming multi-billion multi-billion dollar company yeah over1 billion dollars so um we're hanging out and this guy who's the CE of a multi of a multi-billion dollar company at the moment he goes um he's like yeah he was like oh you do a podcast what's a podcast what is it called oh yeah I'll check it out right and he he's kind of like he's like one of those people that's like busy actually doing something so he's like was kind of detached from like the world of like Twitter and podcast and like content creators and all this stuff but as we're talking he's like oh you know one thing I did see what's with all these like entrepreneurs who own laundromats and hvacs and [ __ ] yeah they're just buying laundromats they're just making like a million dollars a year owning a laundromat like what is this that can't be true he's like this like he's like this either this is not true and they're lying or this is true and what the hell are we all doing why why AR we all owning like 15 laundry mats he's like it's It could only be one of two situations and so we had this hilarious conversation with this guy but there's not a third situation of it is true and it's kind of stupid no he was like if it's true that these things are as you know sort of simple and cash flowy as po as they sound why would we all not just own 15 of these and call it a day and he's like and if it's not true why the hell are they talking about it like it is and um I just thought it was so funny because it was like smart person it's kind of like when you if you took a really healthy person to like a grocery store and walk through the snack aisle they'd be like so this is all just sugar you'd be like well yeah it's like so all the kids food is sugar and then all the adult food is like sugar and salt like what you eat this why wouldn't you just eat normal food and you're like I mean I can't defend it it's just the way I don't know it's just what it is that's how he was talking about like entrepreneurial content that he's run into on on social media just like in passing while he's like trying to like go see friends photos he's like why is this entrepreneur telling me that they make so much money so easily doing something so so so stupid and hands off he's like it's either not hands-off it doesn't make that much money or we are all idiots and it because it is hands-off and makes that much money and I just thought it was such a like it was so funny the way he was ranting about it and he was just like kept and then every 15 minutes during the conversation he'd be like he'd just come back to it we we're talking about a whole different topic and he's like Big O Tires really you could just own 12 Big old tires and that's it he would just come back to a new example of one of these like shitty brick and mortar chains that are like you know so easy sweaty cash flow business I went through this period so I was public about this I bought property uh to do an Airbnb because I was like you know let's see if I'm interested in that and what I've learned is exactly what that guy feels which is if you can make money on the internet or like through content or software or something like that the business is so much better you can create a huge amount of money from nothing you need nothing except you got to work on it with real estate and laundry mats and [ __ ] you make we're talking like single digits if you're really lucky tens of thousands of dollars a month in profit and it's a pain in the butt man it is so hard and you have to have a ton of money to do it uh like it it's quite challenging so I understand now I'm like oh my God like I I have the skill set this is so stupid to do this other thing when this other when this internet thing is so much easier I feel I I totally understand what he's saying and so the other great story this guy told um so I'm try to do this without giving me too much info so he um you know he takes over as CEO of this company he wasn't the original CEO he becomes gets hired as CEO or become CEO um and now this company has like it's like has big scale but it's not profitable so the stock was getting kind of hammered and the company wasn't doing so well because it's not profitable and um so there's all these theories so if you if you just listen to like the pundits they would be like it's a category problem like this category can't be profitable because of a b c and d they're sort of like it's a more like they're all theorizing about it and they' made it sound like it's just a law of physics that it's just not going to work bad category like uh like like like grocery delivery yeah like 15minute grocery delivery or whatever right yeah yeah yeah and so that was if you just listen to the smart pundits you would have just been like H impossible um and if you listen to the original team they'd be like um you know like yeah it's we're working on it it's like no you're not dude every single customer we lose we lose money every time someone buys from us don't you recognize how big of an issue this is like how did you let this go on for this long this way and he's like okay so first act as as CEO he goes to um like the kind of like let's say the place where the the kind of the product is is is developed or made um like it has like a real world product it's like a it's a it's a business that's like Tech enabled but it has like a real world world component yeah um similar to like an Uber or a um uh like Airbnb has like you know there is the physical place so the guy goes and he's like we're like so what' you do and he's like I just sat there I just sat I got a chair and I sat down in the middle and I just watched for eight hours straight he's like I just looked I just looked at what was going on on I had no preconceived judgments I said let me just watch what's actually happening here how is it that we are losing so much money for every order that we get every customer that we get we lose money how is this possible um and he just sits there and he watches it watches and he's like oh okay I see we got too many people doing two little [ __ ] and the manager is not doing what they're supposed to be doing and so he's like I like that guy you're outside for half the time and therefore this person is not doing what they're doing and these three people are all trying to do the same thing he's like I didn't have to like like it wasn't a theoretical problem and it wasn't an inevitable problem it was just a everybody's too distance from the thing problem everybody nobody just sat here for eight hours straight and just watched what the hell is actually going on and and they told the story how they actually turned it around how it's profitable and like so on and so forth and so um I think that's all I can say without giving too much away but I just love this guy I love the story the two things that he that he said out loud was the like hey wait wait pause time out time out we can all just own Big O Tires and and call it a day like if it's that easy we should be doing it if it's not that easy screw those people for saying it and secondly he's like I'm just gonna go sit for eight hours and watch and just really get to a first like a like a a clear understanding of what is actually happening before we come to any other conclusions will you ever do one of these things so I I dip my toes in it and and my thing like it's on paper it's successful it's just like H it's just uh it's emotional baggage what what do you think about yours or are you ever going to do anything like that you mean a business that has real world sweatiness yeah yeah um yeah like for our Ecom thing we ran our own warehouse for a while so that was like you know ultimately my problem if it if things went wrong and I spent many weekends you know like breaking down pallet and reorganizing the warehouse and making it work and looking at the numbers and being like why is this person you know maybe we should measure their rates and like this guy's picking 80 products per hour and this person's picking 40 is it a person thing or is this guy just lazy or what's going on like and just dealing with all those issues you know one guy threatened to kill another guy today at work all right um there's nothing in the handbook for that you know this doesn't make me money but I think it can lose me a did you really have that incident you had that incident got a call that was uh hey um this one guy just threatened to kill the other guy like what should I do like it was kind of a serious threat he's mad like I don't think he's going to do it but he did yell it in front of everybody and I was like well I think you got to fire that guy um right now and I don't know why you're on the phone with me and then the other person like why are they why does that guy want to kill him what did he do instead like you know can we just replace all these people with somebody else you know it was a it was not a there there it's a very hard thing right it's just hard like getting Warehouse Crews that are happy productive and kind you know and and reliable is not like a thing for anybody I have a friend who runs an e-commerce store and they go I'm shutting down my warehouse tomorrow like where can I move we're like oh what happened what happened he goes um someone just [ __ ] all over the floor in the warehouse for no reason and we go dang like what did he do she goes he goes she what did she why did she do it I was like wow just for a woman to just on the floor in a warehouse he's like what what happened what did it take to was it a was it a spite [ __ ] or was it an accident [ __ ] I mean that the intent matters I I asked all the wrong questions apparently because I didn't I didn't ask that one I had 10 questions but that wasn't one what about the NBA player all right NBA NBA player so we meet an NBA player in La um this isn't my story I wasn't there for this but Ben uh related to was very funny he's like um he talked about like yeah so is it uh it's kind of like what do you say to these guys right so like they get a bunch of Fanboys and you don't want to be a fanboy in general I would say there was really two learnings the first was um we go to this thing there's a bunch of NBA players but who cares and like you know they're cool I I think they're cool I think they're it's cool what they do but like this event you know it's like ah it's hard to like what are you going to do they're they're not going to be your friend like this like un very unlike like what do you think is going to happen here like you go in excited oh this person's going to be here you know what they're thinking you know what they're thinking which is like Dam Sean you're pretty tall you ever lace up like you know we we we need we need a fif like are you interested like that's what you want to happen right yeah exactly it's like we we've been waiting for this you know this Indian guy with no athleticism like you know would you like to become my best friend come on the road with us like you know what what's going to happen like meeting Drake it's be like hey you're really like you're really good at speaking do you happen to have a mixtape on you that I can check out want to just want hit hit the studio quick yeah that's what that's what you want to happen so I think the realization was we got excited to go to this event but it's also like cool this event is cool but that's not going to happen nothing's going to happen that's awesome from this event in that way uh two things happen we meet a team owner again Ben runs facial recognition software he's like that guy's a minority owner of the Philadelphia 76ers or something like that and I was like how do you know the minority owners of this he's like I recognize him from something I read and I was like and nobody's talking to this guy because nobody knows this all kind of like older looking dude so we go up to him we're like hey you're blah blah blah normally when Ben does this that person is so elated that somebody kind of knows them that you're a fan of theirs they're nobody's talking to them otherwise they're kind of like they know they're actually pretty dope but nobody at this event knows they're dope this was the opposite this guy just totally big dogged us and made us seem like we were pieces of [ __ ] so we're like oh cool um I asked you 10 questions you gave me exactly 10 words as answers so one word per question and uh you left your airpods in the whole time and then you looked at us at the end like if you ask one more question I'm gonna [ __ ] slap you and so we we had that farted and walked away and then we had the basketball player experience where Ben takes a Ben's like oh look I got this photo with this like famous NBA player and we had a realization the realization was this it's dope if these guys were our friends but it's not going to happen this way the only dope situation is not that we meet them and we're a fan of them and we they recognize us as a fan but that they're a fan of what we do and we're a fan of what they do that's the only cool version of this is do something dope so that they have respect for you as you have respect for them so you should actually spend time instead of chasing them to meet them and get a picture with them and whatever just do dope [ __ ] become a magnet where other people who are awesome will respect you and want to meet you and want to talk to you or have something that they you know some common ground that they could find Pier versus fan B yeah so like showing them your calves was not going to like cut it like oh like I run a 5440 does that do anything for you can you jump H can you jump high those calvs are like a great yeah uh I I wear I wear a Fitbit we have so much in common um so right next thing was NBA players like we so so I have nothing to lose at this point so we're like uh so like what's it like just like having you know tons of chicks that want to be with you like how do you do that how do you navigate that he's like because we're like you know he's got he's like I got a wife I got kids and he's like um he's like I told my wife I said this anytime somebody has that voice yeah I'm in only good things come after that tone he goes I said baby um you're happy right yeah I'm happy baby you got the house of your dreams right yeah yeah baby I gave you three beautiful children right sure sure did they're beautiful children he goes baby you can buy anything you want on this credit card right yeah yeah yeah baby you got to be called my wife right all right what more do you want baby what more do you want he go I just had an open conversation with my wife that like look you're G to have a bunch of amazing things in your in your life and so am I I thought it was oh my God I hate that by the way I hate that of course you hate that I mean it's uh it's not necessarily something that's admirable I'm just saying it was something that was [ __ ] hilarious and nobody's that honest and I thought wow to have the the honesty to tell a stranger that's story is a confidence level that I can only admire um you know do I do that with my wife no of course not what I want to even it oh I do it with my wife except it's a little bit different it's like hey Sarah look you know if someone comes in this home I'm G to go and fight to the death to protect you right whatever you want I'll give you I'll do anything for you take out the trash please usually it's more like that it's like will you be the one who takes out the the the dishwasher today let you do it this week and tomorrow when someone breaks into our home I'll die for you normally it's normally that's the argument that I make yeah yeah again these are all not great traits I would say but uh I found it hilarious This falls in line with just a general thing which was people in La say wild [ __ ] like people in LA are so like name droppy and money droppy it's disgusting is it but they're not even really even aware of it it's crazy like they'll be like um this madeup example but like uh yeah yeah we can meet at my place it's over on um you know Beverly and whatever it's a $4.2 million property it's like whoa whoa whoa why why did you add that at the end like completely unnecessary information complete brag uh out of nowhere and I just kept getting sideswiped by brags as I was walking through La just oh oh sir you dropped this Oh that's oh that's a producer you know yeah that's a name okay here you go go take take that you know like I couldn't believe it and I think SF is obnoxious San Francisco is obnoxious in its own way which ways you'll be like Oh I'm gonna eat dinner they're like dinner is you know actually a necessary study show it's like what dude I just want to eat dinner like don't like make me like we don't have to like be transhuman right now like you know we don't have to like um like not everything has to be a thing or like you know we don't have to use AI to like you know go get a smoothie right now but like you know San Francisco is obnoxious in its own ways but the LA version of being obnoxious I found to be very strange yeah I it it makes me really uncomfortable whenever I'm there it's um every every city is a dick measuring contest but uh the type that they measure in La I it's like the ruler changes right and in San Francisco it's like how ambitious are you right no you say the craziest thing you're working on no no no you say the crazy investment you just made it's like it's an ambition contest and New York is like some power contest and La is basically like a Fame uh a Fame contest or a network contest like who do you know and who knows you when I uh when my wife used to work at Facebook one time Facebook rented out the baseball stadium AT&T park and I remember going there and we wore nice clothes like a suit jacket or whatever but then the engineers would wear it was like a contest to see who could look the most schleppy so it would be like one guy wearing a tuxedo t-shirt it's like oh I see it's like you're ironic that's funny and then another guy would be like just only wearing pajamas and birken stocks or another guy like only pajamas but like dress shoes it's like oh it's cute you make a joke like oh you think that that means you're dressing up get it I get it you're like a brilliant guy you're Einstein and that's the type of contest that you would see there whereas in La it's like uh Land Rovers Range Rovers and uh fancy cars and um everyone has beautiful white teeth and like have you noticed that there the teeth in LA V Let's yeah what about that veneers were I don't know just it was a blind spot for me I didn't even know what the hell V veneers were didn't know who have do you know how you get them dude I went down the rabbit hole I I went on YouTube for like three hours what are these things you like drill each tooth so it's almost looks like a spike and then you like put up these fake things on there and glue them on there so your teeth are like ruined I I believe like they're they're changed forever they are they shave them down I think the bad version is when they really shave too much and it becomes like little spikes and you look like little baby teeth I think the good version is they just take a layer of the enamel off and then they basically glue a fake tooth front onto your thing and it lasts like a decade and then you like get them switched and you have these pearly white they look awful teeth they look like Barney teeth you remember Bary that the puppet or the like it was just like one strip of white yeah I think the good version because I was like again I went down the rabbit hole like the good doc makes them look like they're your teeth and not just like the generic thing uh but I said really like in LA I was like kind of enamored by this veneers thing and I go okay I figured it out there's only two types of people in the world people who have veneers and people who need veneers because like once you see people who don't have veneers almost everyone's teeth are pretty pretty nasty like most people's teeth are kind of yellow kind of you know misshaping whatever people generally don't have great teeth and the people who do have veneers so there's only two types of people in life this is now my belief people who have veneers are people who need them I'm currently in people who need them category and maybe who knows I'll go do them but but for some reason tell me this um plastic surgery like I don't think you or I would ever be like you know what just I wish my eyebrow was a little higher up or whatever you know like dude I wish my I'm not my nose was a little different um the cool thing about being a man is like older men can be like pretty smoking to women you know like George Clooney is like a fine wine you know what I mean like people still like them Brad Pit still looks smoking and my wife's been trying to convince me that like botox for women is okay cuz she'll talk about like botox I'm like no F that just age you look beautiful like it's cool that we're going to age together then I met a couple people who get BOTOX and they're like it's not that big a deal so maybe my opinion is changing on Botox but in general I would say plastic surgery I'm like Let It Be let's age together and we're going to look awesome so I'm generally pretty against that me too uh totally was in that camp as I met more people I'm like it's way more more prevalent than I realized because I'm in a dude Tech bubble uh so it's way more prevalent than I realized and secondly there's something like I kind of get the teeth thing it's like it's like there's there's grades to it right it's like well you do get a haircut do you know maybe you'll shave your beard all right you might buy nicer clothes okay that's that's the thing like uh you know what if you just like you know get the get like a a facial treatment maybe that makes your skin looks a little better okay it's like a kind of like almost like a slipp slope of of the beauty thing and like yeah but what did you see there like fake asses and fake boobs or stuff on men everything dude everything saw everything men with botox you know fake everything everybody's nose was everybody had the same nose um so that was insane uh the power of veneers I was like I just love it's a it's a pleasure to make you laugh because I like seeing that smile no don't fall down this trap do not do it man do not do it so I might show up to one of these podcasts with the veneers and a nose job who knows we'll see what about the thing and or like I I don't know if I told you this I have like a deviated septum I went to ENT person I was like yeah I don't never been able to breathe through my nose very well and they're like yeah because you have like a super screwed up thing like it's like horrible and he's like you should get that fixed I was like okay cool I was like does that change how my nose then they're like looks well yeah they're like while we're there thing like it doesn't have to change how it looks but like we're doing the surgery anyways it's very easy to like you know just shape it and I was like but does that make me lame and he's like that's a personal question like I was like would it be consider like if I did that would I have to tell my boys I got a nose job like what do you like telling this like doctor am I kid I was like yeah I need a 360 opinion here on this like you can't just hit me with the medical I need the medical the personal the social like I need all the opinions he's going to diagnose you as being a douche yeah exactly he's like well your douche levels will go up if if you have be but like you know uh all right maybe last one but what about the rich did you meet with someone who donated hundreds of millions of dollar to high school yeah so uh rich people do really stupid things is the name of my of this topic which is actually they do misguided things to help their kids so I met multiple people who had donated somewhere between singled digigit Millions to double digit Millions one person said 100 million plus but I I don't believe it cuz I don't even know I don't know where that would go to a high school uh I'll give you one I'll give you one F where would even 10 million go to a high scho public example which is that uh you know the fertita brothers the guys who owned the UFC before they sold it the guys who owned casinos in Vegas they uh their kids like to play football as many kids do but unlike many football parents these guys decided that their the high school their Alma moer needed a uh like a division one college level football facility and donated tens of millions of dollars they haven't said the exact number but you can kind of triangulate it because they later donated like 10 or 15 million bucks to a college and it's less than what they gave their high school for their football fac and it's like basically they gave at least $20 million to a high school to build a better football facility so their kids would have a better shot at becoming a better football player and I was like this is such a misguided way such a like inefficient way to help your kids um and I've met many people like this I know people who are wealthy beyond measure and I ask them why you still working like so many hours what are you doing why you taking all this risk they're like okay they're like my dad when I wanted to be an entrepreneur um said you're never going to do it and he refused to give me any money to start start so I I struggled so hard at the beginning um when my kids turn 18 I'm going to give them each $20 million and say like you know I will support you in building any business you want with that you know someone who said that this is their literal plan uh they like and they're saying it bragging to me again crazy brag how old are their kids me their kids are currently their oldest is maybe 10 years old um and their youngest is four so they have four kids that's $80 million uh uh you know allowance that they're they're creating TR the trust fund that they're cating creating for their kids to start these businesses and I I told him I was like well you know that like because you didn't have the resources you developed all these skills which is what made you successful in business like you weren't if you were handed $20 million I don't think you would actually be who you are today um so I I love that you're trying to help your kids but I just don't think what you're doing which is working super hard when they're kids being so busy being busy that you're kind of away from them making all this money that you plan to hand them at 18 like this sounds like a recipe for disaster but you know people hear so you know I don't think that message was was received very well um but you know I just found that people do crazy things in the name of of like their kids and money no I think that that's crazy I think that's exactly how you create like me a future heroin at let me tell you a couple other ones I think are good talk to an investor friend so I have a friend who was a VC at one of the big VC firms he's left he left and started doing his own thing but he has a style and a strategy I think is very different than most people I find it very fascinating so if I asked you I said what's what is like draw me like a picture of the typical Silicon Valley VC like can you just describe some things about them like you know what what are they like what are they doing you know like just the the average VC let's say average VC a a t a tall looking white guy who wears um a sweater um and brown shoes or shoes that have white SES like white bottoms uh and they basically meet tons and tons of people of tons of coffee meetings yeah tons of coffee meetings lots of introductions from other people who come from really amazing universities and they'll pass on most of them but then they'll invest uh like 50 to 100 companies uh smallest checks and then never hear from uh they don't really talk to the founder often unless things are going really bad and they [ __ ] out yeah exactly they say they're going to be value ad they invest in uh dozens of maybe 40 50 companies over their lifespan of like a couple years they're taking tons of coffee meetings they're super agreeable they'll only kind of smile and say nice things to your face typically they um cast a wide net they they love going to MEK networking events they'll say that like uh we're a Founders first company we're founder first we're founder friendly we invest in world changing ideas yeah all of them all of them only invest in the best somehow um every single VC only invest in the best uh they they do all those things this is an investor friend that has a Twitter egg profile picture they go to no networking events that are like VC run and and or like kind of generic founder events um they do go to random events that are like oh I'm going to this biohacker Meetup in Downtown Oakland where people are going to like shoot themselves up with DNA it's like okay I'll go to that like they go to those types of events um they have a strategy which is basically here's what he told me he goes every year one company becomes like kind of the center of the universe and my job is to have invested in that company three years ago and I go wow okay go so what give me examples he goes well like you know uh back when we met I met this person in 2012 or 2013 they were like you know stripe was actually the center of the universe at that time stripe was the company that like was the clear breakout recently he's like um most recent ones last year would have been open AI so open AI before kind of like our like early chat gbt or before releasing gpt3 um right now I go right now who is it right now he goes OIC OIC is the center of the universe right now and I was like oh interesting so not just like tech companies when I last time I talked to this person was maybe three years ago um in Earnest and I was like so what are you up to nowadays and generic usually the answer is like oh a little bit of this a little bit of that this person said I quit my job and I am just hunting down a way to own a piece of only fans I go what the porn thing and he's like yeah only fans I think is going to be massive I think it's you know it's one of it's the center of the universe right now and people are it's going to be the center of the universe people won realize it I think it's going to be one I think it's going to be the one of this like this year kind of cohort this is going to be the company that matters so my only mission is to add so much value to the owner of only fans that um I can invest in it or own a piece of it somehow and if I don't whatever at least I was helping that rocket ship go and you know previously it might have been SpaceX or Tesla was like you know those that the company and um Bitcoin ethereum like those are like some of the other ones that had their their they owned that that year there was no more valuable company that was like creating more value that would then in the future be realized and uh I just thought it was awesome I thought it was an amazing I was I'm just so happy that this person's a friend that like thinks so differently operates so differently than the the average person has he been successful has been successful and he told me was like I go so what's the strategy here he goes oh I'm trying to make all the best investments I can so I can make the worst investment of my life and buy this like soccer club in Europe that I grew up loving and he's like he's like I'm I'm trying to make the best investments ever so that I can make the one worst investment ever and uh and does he use other people's money in the past he did I think now he's doing a lot of his own or he'll raise spvs like I was like oh you invest in this company cool what how much do you invest he goes $100 million and I go 100 million I $1 million he's like yeah I raised a $100 million SPV because I believe in this company and I'm and you just it puts your own conviction and ambition in check you're like so what's the company I believe most in how much have I plowed into that and why is that number not 100 million right like you can only like self-check when you hear stuff like this in a good way it's a frame breaker I said where'd you get the 100 million he goes from one LP I convinced one person and they they were actually already convinced actually that person was kind of already convinced that this was a good company I busted my ass to get the ability to put a $100 million check in and they put the money in what did he put $100 million doll in can you say I can't say has it worked uh I don't again it's you bake these things three four years ahead and it will find out like did that company was that the right place to concentrate like a laser beam of conviction so I loved that conversation and meeting that person so that was one uh that I think is great um let me give you one more that I think is oh here's a quick one neighborhoods not cities you're I think a great person to talk about this because you've been traveling around trying to find cool places to live you don't pick at the city level you pick at the neighborhood level um it's actually what is the best neighborhood to be in not what is the best city to live in I just that was like an obvious understanding to me once you go to a place like LA or you know you you've done this in in New York or uh Brooklyn or and it's really hard to do that by the way like the idea that like let's say that you're a normal person your home is likely going to be the biggest purchase of your entire life and it will unfortunately be the uh for most people it'll be the largest portion of their net worth and it's pretty insane that you make that decision a 20 or 30-year decision off one maybe two one hour visits uh like in like for a uh uh open house it's it's it's it's insane and you did this I think way back in the day I think you created one of these for San Francisco I think it was the um the roommate infographic for neighborhoods in San Francisco it's like if you live in this neighborhood here's who your roommate's going to be like which is so brilliant because it's a about neighborhoods and B it's about people um because people is also what makes your experience when you're in a in a city it's not this it's not the environment basically in 2014 we had this app and in order to make it popular we launched in five cities San Francisco Boston Manhattan LA and Chicago I believe and what we did was we're like all right in order to make things go viral we have to name as many names of local restaurants and local people that we can think of cuz those people will share if we name like 50 of them in each one that's 50 people sharing in that City That's How we'll get uh that's how we'll get popular and so we created this thing called the stereotypical roommates of Los Angeles stereotypical roommates of San Francisco and if you Google them you could find them and we just made like a infographic that made fun of each neighborhood and all the brands and places that they shopped at and that way you could like figure out what restaurants were like that neighborhood but those restaurants and the people in those neighborhoods would share and here's the thing at that period I don't think I i' had never been to New York I had never been to Boston we just looked at Yelp we just went to Yelp and look at one of the most popular things and we found the jokes that people were making about it and then that's how we made the infographic and it went like crazy I think we got tens and many many tens of thousands of downloads for the app in the first day I saw that before I ever met you I read that thing when I moved to San Francisco somebody shared it because it was so funny and like kind of like oh that's funny cuz it's true like so it was actually useful too because it was like yeah it was a little bit stereotyping generalizing but it was it was true for the most part so I thought that was so so good and I kind of wish somebody did that for every city now like just keep exactly whenever I go and look at new neighborhoods I I try always to go to a bar and I say what's the stereotype of this neighborhood and I'll ask the bartender or whatever I'm like tell me the stereotypes uh and they'll be like oh a lot of gay people are moving in and I'm like all right up and coming got it that's what that means like gentrifying or like oh like what's the stereotype in this neighborhood tons of strollers so I'm like all right Rich uh Young families all right got it what else you know what I mean like there's all these like things codes it's like that's a it's like you know if you're in the government it's like oh it's a it's a 38333 that's the government code that means x uh this is the same thing it's like when somebody says critically acclaimed cool code for not profitable thank you uh Mo moving on yeah or boring um for the everyday man got it okay yeah I got a couple other quick ones for you rattle off uh one more uh I'll give you a networking hack so Tim F back in the day did this blog post called how to build a worldclass network and record time or something like that I loved that I I remember reading that and like kind of like getting inspired by that um so I don't know if you know this but business partner Ben I think is the greatest networker in the world actually I've now come to realize this I had no idea um I had no idea what was going on until recently I've now now learned this um he is working the phones and he is just like it's so funny too but what he does is he just checks in on people like just this morning he texted my friend from college that I had introduced him to once this my one of my best friends from college that were helping buy a business and he goes yo I uh yo I remember you said that the close date was supposed to be 7:31 did it end up closing and I was like bro how did you even remember to check in like he's the he's the perfect boyfriend basically he's just [ __ ] checking in and supporting everybody like barop you could probably attest to this and all of our we work together I probably text you I don't know couple times a year Max uh and it's usually about something that's like urgent sort of transactional can I'm just guessing that you talk to Ben fairly often uh could you just describe this for a second because I think there's something to learn here out of this whole thing yeah I could pull up my text he he probably hits me up like two or three times a week like how's The X Project going or how's how's X going yeah he's a beast this data is wrong every freaking time have you heard of HubSpot HubSpot is a CRM platform where everything is fully integrated W I can see the client's whole history calls support tickets emails and here's a task from 3 days ago I totally missed H spot grow better so I noticed this because I would meet people and then somehow afterwards they're only keeping in touch with Ben I'm like dude am I just unlikable I was like and I think there's something to it I I definitely give off some some stink that's like you know repels people but Ben has the opposite effect on people he draws them in he's like a golden retri and he's always smiling he's just harmless and people people like him and he's helpful he's just supportive and helpful to everybody and so he's like he knows here's what he's figured out he's figured out that most people just nobody checks in with them so he's he checks in on how's that that your mission in life how's that going does he do it on his cell phone or on the computer on his phone then they reply with like a long ass update and I'm like you're basically just saying Sup and then the Su is generating this like highly interesting response and then what he does is he's just like connects dots so he'll be like oh you should talk to that guy like oh you uh you really like this TV show we just met the writer you should meet him and he'll just connect dots and like he he's just a DOT connector and then people are like oh that was helpful or like once he knows you're trying to do X like let's say he knows Sam you're trying to um do some uh body fat thing he'll then just start sending you tweets just little links like that are related to it and and he's also what's it called like INF fatigable like you can ignore like you probably ignored the last four that he sent don't matter no hard feelings gonna keep him coming and I'm like wow this is just a recipe so this kind of led me to this understanding of okay Ben is world class at this fantastic but in general Ben's kind of like my wingman he's like my number two and everybody's got like a number two at some once you get to a certain level you get like a number two and actually the number two guy network is the most under tapped resource so why were we meeting these NBA players because we're friends with the number two of an NBA player and it's like and guess what nobody knows that guy everybody wants to get to the NBA player nobody even knows this guy's name but he's got all the access he's got 98% of the access that the NBA guy has but he's got 2% of the like um the the busyness and which we did with uh with huberman's guy um God I'm blanking on his first name uh what What's his name um Rob Rob Moore uh yeah I went out to I hung out with that guy in LA and he was like he runs the hubbin show hubb's the face but this guy's got all the keys he's like oh yeah we interviewed this person if you ever want to talk let me know the keys to the kingdom and generally these people are nicer less busy um they're the ones who actually do a lot of the [ __ ] work so they're actually more interesting people um uh they also were like the gatekeeper like they decide who gets in who gets out what opportunities come in what gets out and they're hit up way less they're hit up way less so they're they're way more available and they're very helpful they they they know a bunch of the other people and so I'm like oh [ __ ] the number two guy Network I don't know what I'm gonna do with this but I've had the Insight now and I'm like I I actually get along better with the number two guys for all those reasons I just mentioned and I just think that this is like an underta resource and I get why everybody hits up Ben now cuz he's the number two guy and some people have figured out this Arbitrage that you should hit up the number two guy CU he's you know nicer smarter better faster more accessible all the things and um so this was just a realization for me on the networking side one of the one of the few like big unlocks I think that I've had before we wrap up did you what was this thing about bucked up is that someone you met with in La I didn't meet them but I heard I met somebody who told me their story and I was blown away had you ever heard of bucked up no what is it so bucked up a hunting thing is this a hunting thing no no no okay let me tell you don't even look it up let me just tell you the story so um starts basically in the two in the in early 2000s there's these two guys two twin brothers I think and they just do affiliate marketing so they're like affiliate marketing they're like hey um it's 2001 Google is not that competitive we can basically say oh you want leads for your lawyer practice cool what are you gonna pay us we'll get you leads for that you want leads for your apartment thing we'll get you that you want leads for this uh this supplement will get you that so and at that time those guys killed it those guys are killing it kill it uh by 201 so they've been do they do this for about 10 years they're making money by 2010 they're generating 25 million a year in Revenue with only three employees that means they're basically pulling in like 20 million a year of profit uh as yeah if their if their if their uh cbcs are low or the cost per clicks were low which back back then they were maybe I'm super aggressive yeah I thought it was it' be pretty low then maybe I'm super aggressive let's say it's 8 to 10 million in profit I think it's a very a ton which is just amazing three people doing this so this was like you know what they were doing my partner my partner Joe by the way Joe spyer my partner in Hampton he started this and when he was 25 he sold the business it was called epic advertising he was the affiliate marketer he sold a portion of the business for $250 million that's amazing and it was all this affiliate marketing stuff and so these guys they're doing the affiliate marketing thing and a guy comes to them and says um this is now like a decade later right and he comes them and says hey I have this supplement called L Arginine uh and the Brand's called L Arginine plus and he's like I don't know what L Arginine does but like um it's like a vitamin I think it helps make you sleep or does it give you energy I think it uh gives you energy or does it help your brain function better who the hell knows I don't know one of I think you're supposed to drink it with caffeine and it gives you energy I think yeah maybe uh like right now generic is the one but back then it was argine was the one and so the guy go aai e bols and [ __ ] it's all it's all or a Kai Berry or whatever the [ __ ] that thing is it's all a different thing every time what's that [ __ ] called what's that Brazilian [ __ ] called aai I Ain't eat No aai Berries it's like whenever I see the word uh Koba Foods all right what's that Koba quinua uh no Koba I know quinoa quo yeah it's like what do you call uh do you ever use to call a I used to think that laquint in was laqua you know what I'm talking about the Quita I didn't know funny thing is the thing you said you say it how do you say it now because I think it's also completely wrong what's it called laquint what's supposed to be called I think it's Kint but I don't know laqua so so guy approaches him says hey I'm making $250 a day on this lrgy thing will you guys my affiliate marketers quickly in three weeks they ramp it up it's now making like over $3,000 a day okay that's pretty good $3,000 a day that's like 100k a month they own 50% of this thing and they buy line.com to get an exact match they're ranking number one that's doing pretty well and then he reads this article so he's interested in this supplement game he reads this article that Major League Baseball just banned deer antler spray never heard of it what the hell is deer antler spray looks it up finds that de antler uh has some extract that's supposed to help you with recovery damn must be if it's so good that the MLB bans it that means [ __ ] must be fire like there's gonna be a lot of so he he he takes he he has the right what is that Chris barley thing did you learned the right lesson he learned the right lesson from that news which was this [ __ ] must be fire and every athlete's gonna want it so he buys deer antlers spray.com for $8 and he's uh he owns the domain he's is the number one rank and it goes okay at first not not a huge demand but he's kind of he's there and then I don't know if you remember this but one year before the Super Bowl Ray Lewis was the killed the guy uh no he killed the guy I think the year before but during the playoff run he gets hurt got it and there's a two we there's like a there's like an extra week rest between like the Super Bowl and and the playoffs or whatever I think The Story Goes Ray Lewis is hurt but he's got to play in the Super Bowl and then he plays amazing and they win the Super Bowl and he's and it comes out that he used deer antler spray to like recover during that week and to like get rid of the pain and allow him to play well demand explodes through the roof baby and uh GNC comes to him and says hey we'd like um 30 units he's like okay cool no problem like oh no no sorry 30,000 units and he's like oh what they're sold out everywhere as soon as they they they they they get all this influx of demand they're they're trying to keep up so for one or two years they're just keeping up with the new demand and being the number one player in this deer antler spray thing but as they go they're like okay we we're kind of limited it's like very Niche what if we expand this to um to something a little bit bigger so they change the name from deer antler spray to bucked up they kind of stay with the deer oh my God they Chang it to bucked up because one of the GNC franchises who they were chilling with goes yeah you know what sells really well but like you know look it doesn't look that good is these pre-workout supplements so basically the powder you take before you work out that remember n explode yeah no explode uh dude that thing was ass it that would that would you could remove paint with that thing I used to take that [ __ ] and you would lift so much weight but it would make you feel miserable after I don't even know what was in it yeah it felt like your heart was going to explode it should have just been called like you know artery explode and like you know one out of 10 people die of this thing it was crazy but like that category of pre-workout supplements turns out is a very big category um so bucked up today they say is the number one pre-workout supplement this thing does guess how much revenue this does I have no idea 10 250 million a year apparently bucked up does dude the flavor so it's called mother bucker that's one of their things the mother Bucker and it just says like their slogan should be like strong as an ax like this is like ridiculous P Focus strength energy the mother of all pre-workouts mother bucker that's crazy to me this is nuts you know sometimes when I'm flipping the channels on TV I'll see like um you know hust minhaj and he's just like you know this guy who's who's this comedian he makes the world laugh he's so goodlook he's you know happy he's having all this success and I think you know I was maybe one or two you know right turns away from from going down that path when you see bucked up do you think this cuz I feel like you were one or two right turns away from being the Creator owner and soulle proprietor of bucked up.com selling motherbucker pre-workout powders to people on the internet yeah maybe maybe I mean I don't know 90,000 square foot factory in Missouri um and just like you know have a huge antler tattoo on your back and a soul patch go dude listen the flavors are woke AF another one is the B High the the other one is the BAM High s ulation uh another one is the lfg Pre-Workout let's [ __ ] go another one is called rut this is hilarious these are all like really good names of like really mean dogs you know what I mean like I'm gonna have like a really like a my junkyard dog named Buck get him buck that's like what this stuff is you know or like rut you like this is crazy this is deer antler are from that to this it's kind of an an insane uh ins story and uh yeah I just and they still kill it yeah they're doing really well right now apparently I mean I mean I'm talking to I know this from one guy and then what you Google about them but like apparently just crushing it oh my God I have no idea what's in this stuff I would like I mean this might be a legit performance-enhancing drug is it still illegal for the MLB because maybe I will order it exactly like haha that's so insane you know as you check out well people talk about performance- enhancing drugs like it's a bad thing but I'm like I would love my performance to be enhanced right you I mean it's the main problem with my performance that it's unenhanced right now how do I enhance my performance I really want it to be enhanced I prefer it to be enhanced than unenhanced so like give me the peed so I'm like in favor of some peeds uh not not if it means you break the rule but uh [ __ ] up we never talked about this did you see that thing the enhanced games that somebody was creating uh was that the um was that just the uh different sports but for steroid users it's basically like it's like you know I feel like every College bro had this like conversation in their dorm room which like they should just do the Olympics but with the drugs like you could take anything and see what happens like I want to see somebody run like a two second 100 meter dash and it's like these guys created it it's called The enhanced games and it's happening and I don't know if you've uh came out and it almost looked like um like satire like it wasn't happening so if you go to it it's enhanced. comom they call it a better version of the Olympics yeah exactly that's a great that's a great we're basically Airbnb but better performance performance enhanced um I can't find their website down right now the website's down but enhanced games is a planned international sports event where the athletes will not be subject into drug testing it's meant to take place in December of 2024 so the guy Aeron duza is the same guy that Peter teal funded to take down Gawker by the way okay sign me up prolific um you know uh best LinkedIn ever so he here here's how he does it he says athletes are adults they have the right to do with their body as they wish my body my choice your body your choice and no government uh should be making these decisions for athletes particularly those around the FDA yeah so here's what he said he goes here's the game plan he goes uh every athlete who participates is going to be a a part owner in the thing because you're you're generating you know part of the opportunity I assume that if you were an Olympian and you won a gold medal your life is made it's not the case it's sad to see people who' have achieved the highest level of Human Excellence are living living an objectively impoverished existence afterwards um but you know the bureaucrats who own these things make millions um we took the Olympics has 13,000 athletes we're reducing that to maybe a thousand um with no special infrastructure so instead of costing a 100 billion to deliver this it'll cost us you know just double digit millions and um yeah they have like a bunch of things uh you know here's kind of like their their belief system so it says the enhanced games will be a competitor to the corrupt and dysfunctional Olympic Games the first intern it will be the first international sports event without drug testing Olympics are about the past it's about G Greek gods from history the enhanced games are about the future we're building superheroes and um it talks about how the ioc is corrupt like the the committee that runs the Olympics and um that you know anti-aging gets styed because of all the anti-science like you know authorities trying to like take drugs out of out of uh performance and we're trying to do the opposite it's my body my choice um he says uh thinking think back 50 years ago being a gay man was like being an enhanced man today it stigmatized marginalized and illegal in some senses okay I don't know about that um yeah and then I don't know if it's actually going to happen or not this it seemed it seemed well their website doesn't work so like we'll see they can't afford their GoDaddy renewal for the domain but uh no I think I'm I'm I think I'm cool with that my a big I mean besides Lance Armstrong kind of used to be my hero and then he like got in trouble for lying and I kind of like got upset about that but besides that whole lying thing I was like they're all doing it and he's doing it as well and he's still won so like it's kind of fair right uh so I and so I do get that I I I'm I'm kind of on board with that and I think a lot of the peeds are pretty amazing like you know what uh EPO is it makes you uh get more red red blood cells in in your blood infite endurance basically yeah you have better endurance and I hear about that stuff and I'm like that sounds great give me more of that I want that uh you know what I mean like there and there's some anabolic steroids that you know you'll die young there was this um which I don't like but there was this one have you seen the guy on on Instagram he was only 30 but I think his name was Joe I forget what his like handle was it was like Joe like all ripped or something and he was the guy who you would see flexing and he was so lean and big that you would see it looked like he had little spiders in his chest CU all the little muscles were like flexing I think it called his name was like Joe Flex have you seen that guy no that sounds well he died like last week he died like oh that was that guy okay yeah yeah I've seen he died last week because uh I he definitely was on the juice uh and he was just it's really hard to be that lean for that long so you have to be on a ton of stuff and he died and so like I'm not in favor of that type of stuff but uh some of the other performance enhancing drugs like I actually think that you could you you'd be a healthier longer living human being if you took some of that stuff or like blood doping so like in the 60s this runner in Finland named lass Von he would like go up in the mountains and no one would see him when he was training and what they alleged that he did with blood doping you could just take out some of your blood and you could put it in a refrigerator and that gives that oxidizes it gives it uh it gives you more red blood cells ultimately and you just inject it back in your body that's considered illegal that's crazy to me it's not illegal it's it's against it's against rules uh for for the Olympics but that's insane that blood doping like that is illegal it's like well dude it's just your blood you're just freezing it and putting it back in you things like that you can't do but I've thought about that uh I think it'd be amazing there was a guy in Netflix who did it where he was an amateur cyclist and he was like I'm going to blood dope and I'm going to document this and this was uh the whole documentary and it was awesome he crushed he killed it he like improved so much and I thought that's pretty cool I think this actually would be a good uh YouTube or podcast um Channel have you ever gone on YouTube down a rabbit hold of college ethics classes have you ever seen this no no sounds boring as hell but it's actually kind of interesting it's not very interesting because it's not made for YouTube but basically if you go like you can basically sit in on a Stanford or Harvard e ethics class well they'll pose some question like should you be allowed to like are are performance enhancing drugs should they be allowed in the Olympics or whatever like some philosophical question like the version of the trolley thing where it's like if you could save five lives and pull the trolley and kill one would you do it right like that those kind of like moral and ethical like thought experiment questions and you see people just stand up in a college lecture hall and they're like uh I say no because blah blah blah blah and then somebody says stands up and says um I disagree I would say yes because I think that what about blah blah blah blah and you just see the debate I think debate is actually like pretty um interesting I think if somebody did that well you could do a kind of like NPR style or gimlet style like intelligent but entertaining podcast series or YouTube channel that like just gets like find these things like the the equivalent of like um somebody I I was at one of these dinners in La somebody goes I had jury duty and the case that I had jury duty for was actually kind of interesting this guy um this guy goes online and he's in this online Forum or Community for like kind of like kinky meetups okay nothing illegal about that and um there's a woman there who says um hey me and my husband really want to do a thing it's you know here's our thing it's kind of weird but like we want somebody to come over and we want to role play like a kind of like a rape scenario and uh she's like so you know um I'm looking for somebody who wants to do that this guy's like that's fun I can do that and she's like cool um so here's what's going to happen you're going to come over to this place I'm going to act surprised I'm gonna say no that's part of the bit we're gonna do it anyways and you know we're all good like a setup was it like a different woman no the guy the husband was role playing it it was bad so the husband was on this forum as acting as if he was the woman saying their in on it she wasn't his wife was not so now this guy's so the jury duty was should this guy be go to jail for rape what a horrible scenario for everyone involved lose lose lose right like just terrible right but it was kind of like an interesting question it's like well like on one hand what a conniving husband yeah he like okay definitely the husband should be in trouble like that's kind of a temp scenario but this guy like should he go to jail for like 20 years because of this scenario or not like and the the vote was basically like should this go to like it's like an indictment so it's like should he go to should this go to trial or no should this not be not go to trial or whatever and we had this just like fascinating dinner conversation about it just hearing everybody's kind of pin hearing like a little bit of a a healthy kind of debate or just like a perspective on it similarly there was another one that was like uh you know uh this couple um uh looks like they're holding um drugs like crack or whatever cop starts chasing after them they throw something away in the trash um cop you cop grabs them they don't have it on them he's like I saw you dump it in the trash they he opens up the trash sees it there but who's to say they didn't throw something else away right should they go to jail for this like uh this offense and it's like well on what if you're the jury like you kind of do think like they they probably didn't but you don't have like um uncontroversial or whatever like evidence that like leaves no Shadow of Doubt that they that they did it and it's like kind of a nonviolent offense do we really want to punish them you you start bringing your own subjective opinion into this versus what you're supposed to do as a jury member so anyways I just the conversation was so interesting that I thought I think this could make for an interesting pod or YouTube channel what do you think you have a good sense for Content what do you think you I think I think it would be great I think I would I think you could do a YouTube channel a 10 minute 10minute videos where you could uh dissect some of these interesting things and just have one take a take a side debate and then people live vote um I I think wasn't there an app that was trying to do this where it was like live debates and you vote on who's the winner maybe do you not remember that yeah in 2014 yeah I think you could kill it it's it's where it's uh you know almost like remember um you know drunk rap battles where it's like Napoleon versus like Caesar uh yeah yeah you do this in that situation I think like it's it's an incredibly uh interesting topic I mean clearly if you've got gotten into it yeah I think it could work cool um all right that's all I got for my trip to La hope actually I had a bunch more but uh I think that's that's also Aran you've been to this place yeah I went there before and I um wanted to buy the most expensive bottle of water they had to see what it was about and it was like 20 or 30 bucks but it's fun a fun fun experience how's the water it was fine it was normal but and I also bought like the most expensive I I wanted to I was like whatever like the most expensive chocolate is and water I'm getting it I think they have like asparagus there like asparagus water that's really this is also a layup Tik Tok Channel um you know airwan experiments or the airwan taste tests you just go to famous people there though what's that that's why you go but did you see any famous people that's why you go no I was just looking at the snacks is that what I was supposed to be doing oh God this is like it's like in college when I used to go to the bar and uh you know I'm there to listen to the music and I said I didn't meet anybody like missed the point yeah you're like doing Long Island IC tasting talking to the Bender I forgot yeah you're supposed to go and see famous people no it's a fun experience that place kills it uh they're expanding I think aren't they don't they have multi they used to be one just in Sant mon 13 or something like that um for those who don't know aan is basically like the bougi it makes Whole Foods it makes Whole Foods look like the dollar store yeah you like you look down at Whole Foods people as peasants yeah aroan is to Whole Foods as aoli as to mayonnaise it's the like just Jazz of version the cool part about it is it has a lot of products that are like almost like it's like a d d Toc popup shop it's like here's a bunch of products that are not the normal things that are on the shelves so you can try them and they're all three times more expensive than they should be or maybe five times more and um I think a layup content thing would be go to aan buy all the chocolates or buy all the chocolates versus Awan versus Walmart and you do blind taste tests and you like absolutely try to rank them and you just give your recommendation you spend the money on the stuff and you just do like air shopping you're just you become the airan guy like dude if I was broke again I'd be back I'd be back so fast because I just know where these little content niches are right you just see it and you know it like another one is pranks I hate the pranks dude have you seen this guy who does the I think his name is Jody or something like that like um what is this guy's channel the guy who went to sleep at an NBA at WNBA game did you see this no no but I hate the pranks where it's like people like prank pick a fight with you and then the person responds and actually beats him up and then the recipient is like it was just a prank bro so this guy J or jidon Jadon I don't know how you say it exactly I love his video so he goes he went to the WNBA All-Star game he bought four courtside seats dropped like you know like whatever 25k on these seats and then he came with a blanket and like guess looks like like a eye mask just [ __ ] and he's like the funny thing is they asked him about it was like dude I had the idea cuz I knew this would like go viral just fall asleep cuz he's done it before like he goes to a a basketball game Courtside and he brought his Barber and they put like the the the bib on him and he gets a haircut during the game but like if you're just watching TV you're like is that guy getting a haircut like is is like very obvious and so he had this idea he's like I wasn't gonna do it I thought it might be too mean I told my friend about it I was like yo maybe you want to do it the guy was like he's like that guy got so excited because he knew this would go so viral I was like nah [ __ ] it I'm gonna do it myself he's like so I did it he's like but then it turned into like a political thing which is not how I intended it like he got banned from all NBA events he got banned from all NBA and WNBA events for for doing this but this guy's just so good at trolling the world and it's like that's just like a it's a uh it's a nich that will never get old like you what an [ __ ] though there's just like infinite demand for um he also caught one of the NBA balls and tried to shoot it from his seat like cuz he to his court side dude he's so he's so he's so funny this guy um all right I think we should wrap up there that's the Pod we done [Music]

any Creator businesses out there that are shockingly large that many people don't know about one that I was wildly impressed by was Garman the largest scripted YouTube channel on the internet I think most people thought that you couldn't do scripted storytelling on YouTube and actually make it a profitable business they figured out how to create content on a scripted basis much quicker and much more cost efficient Darr was doing something completely different and then he pivoted into this I'm pretty sure this guy had a giant Wii business before this

this is an example of a business that is um what I call one chart businesses I'm full of catchy today one chart businesses so what's a one-chart business there are times you can look at one chart and one chart alone can be your business plan [Music] all right we're live what's going on I haven't seen you in a week I know what's going on forever um nice jacket uh by the way that's fresh wearing white is appreciated Choice the summer move it's a summer move you're going to Reuben's party or what uh no I I don't think I'm I'm not on that was it last year that you were in the Hamptons when Rick Rubin was having his party and you were like what's this and you didn't wasn't there some story like you hung out with all the limo drivers the Uber drivers yeah the parking lot instead of basically the the beach that I went to was Five Doors Down from his house it's a public beach and there's a parking lot there and me and my family were just there hanging out we drove by we saw like you know Henny Henry kravis the founder of KKR you know like 50 billion dollar guy like pull up at his two billion dollar or two million dollar Bugatti we park in the parking lot and I see all these huge escalates all black Escalades and I see like these it's mostly like these you could tell their drivers they're in suits they're playing soccer and eating sandwiches and drinking soda and I walk over I'm like what the hell is this and they're like oh it's this guy named Michael Rubin who throws his party I go well who are you driving and they actually tell me who they're driving and I'm like I'm seeing how as I am I I go like all right like what's the what's the stick on them like are they a good Tipper what's their deal are they like spilled the beans on like what it's like he's like oh this person's actually broke you know like he always haggles with us over 500 or yeah so I hung out the parking lot in Michael rubin's party most uh uh relatable Blue Collar thing to do is just to go and be like hey pass the sunflower seeds and just start kicking it with these guys in the parking lot I saw it it was like a movie a little bit it was like they were just like playing soccer and drinking Coke yeah by the way the way you described that was definitely like straight out of like a favela and Brazil you're like yeah they were just uh drinking Coca-Cola and eating sandwiches while playing soccer in the park in the gravel that's really what they were doing I mean it was it was it was like but it was fun and you know it was all like these Long Island guys like hey what are you doing you know like that type of thing I saw a video of that party and I think the reaction when they post that video for most people is like oh my God like so cool I you know I hope one day I can attend this the white party at Michael rubin's house I gotta say I saw that thing and I was like this would be my worst nightmare it'd be very uncomfortable right having to look cool uh just that alone is already I have a halfway to Hell having to look cool dressed up first Sean's wearing a Mickey Mouse t-shirt right now just fly uh by the way I bought this recently this is new this isn't like some old thing in the closet this was I bought this during my trip just now um so having to look cool and then going to a place with a bunch of people who are super famous and then having to like be in tell a story be in conversations and like trying to get into conversations and then be in those conversations I just want to go home I don't even I just I already want to go home and I wasn't even invited so Michael Rubin you could lose my invite is what I'm trying to say yeah it's like you'd rather play their their characters in Madden than actually hang out with yeah I would just start cleaning it I'd be like I'm just gonna make myself useful here because the the rest socializing is not gonna work I'm just gonna I'm gonna Marie condo this right now and like start taking out trash and like I'll just join the serving the crew like serving appetizers because I'd be like I know I will have more fun doing anything besides this where do you want to go from here I was looking at a company called after after.com ever heard of this after.com a very good uh domain so an amazing domain so after.com is cremation as a service basically and you could pre-plan it or you can do it after somebody passes away the reason I actually want to talk about this it's an interesting business on its own this is an example of a business that is um what I call one chart businesses I'm full of catchy today one chart businesses so what's a one-chart business there are times you can look at one chart and one chart alone can be your business plan so for example have you seen the rise in the popularity of cremation no popping off nowadays cremation is like uh yeah it's in right now so I saw this chart I thought did not everyone get uh so basically cremation um in the United States in like the last I don't know 20 years or something like that has gone from like 10 of the population chooses cremation to over 50 I think it's actually it's almost 60 or 70 now which is like kind of insane I had no idea this was true um uh so burial rates uh are going down and cremation rates are going way up um and you just see that one chart alone you're like okay in 20 years this the the thing has shifted where it went from the super minority to the majority all right that alone tells me there's room for building interesting business in this space it's a one-chart business and there's actually been several of these that I've like encountered over the years like one chart uh one chart can tell you tell you a full story um and so this is this is one of them and uh these guys have built a really good business on top of this I don't want to go into too much detail about their actual thing but I just thought that was crazy and this is like where like what you guys had with Trends was like kind of like a cool business because you guys would identify trends like this you would say okay yeah and the 19 in the 1960s cremation was three percent and then in 1990s it grew to 17 and right now in 2020 it's over 50 um if that's true then what what are all the second order consequences of that who are the providers for this who does the B2B e-commerce of this who has the highest SEO ranking for this and that website's actually being way more popular than than they realize because um this is growing over time and so you take that one chart and you can actually run a whole business plan off wow so do they uh I'm a yes you're right and B I'm looking at after.com they I don't think they've raised money they're they're they're Mormons they're based out of provost uh Provo Utah um uh this is this is wild how did you find this uh they reached out because I was I told people I was buying minority stakes and businesses and investing in businesses and I think these guys are raising money or wanted to I think they're raising money not try to sell uh they're I think they're trying to go big fundraise so um they reached out this definitely could be big it's twenty five hundred dollars their Tam is everyone right on Earth we're all getting there eventually dude but they don't own like uh an oven do they like they just like it's the logistics so basically what they do is they get the lead they then book the kind of like the they either take the prepayment if you're gonna do it ahead of time or um afterwards they they say okay we will be your provider they can do like kind of like the full Logistics so basically you know it's like the Domino's Pizza Tracker right pick up drop off delivery like did they do the whole thing um you know and you can see kind of Step by Step where you're at in the process this is wild uh so to your first point um our good buddy Jack Smith you know he started fungal sold it for 750 million dollars it was making a million dollars a day in Revenue he told me I was like Jack why'd you start fungal he's like well I just saw that uh mobile like like games on your phone were gonna be really popular I just saw like a chart I think he said from Forester research report he's like I just saw this chart that says like oh mobile games are like taking over the world and he was like what can we make on top of that uh like and that's why he came up with fungal which was ads in a game and so he built an ad Network and it was the same thing where he's like oh that's a thing let's just get on that title wave and like just like no matter which surfboard we pick Let's just pick a board and hopefully it will catch and uh and that was like the same famously Jeff Bezos says this is how he decided to quit his job in uh I think he worked at some private Equity Firm uh that's famous and he quit his high paying job and was like I'm gonna go start I'm gonna go start a uh internet company why internet company he goes I read a stat doing my research for at the firm that the internet is growing uh two thousand three hundred percent per year and that blew my mind and if that's true then I'm gonna go build an internet company that line is a beautiful line so we actually use that quote on the front page of Trends where he goes I started he goes uh he goes I saw a report that said the internet was going by twenty three hundred percent per year nothing grows that fast unless it's in a Petri dish uh and he's like that's what I knew I had to start something and so I wrote a list of ideas of things that we could possibly sell on the internet and we just so happened to choose books yeah exactly they chose books because he was like oh I what is the advantage of the internet you could have infinite selection because there's there's no shelf space limit right there's no physical shelf so he's like what has a wide selection okay what also won't go bad can't be perishable it has to be durable um and then what all what is easy to ship and so he's like you know those three and he's like there's market demand for it cool books books will be the place where we start um by the way I just found uh Steph Smith so former you know writer of Trends had a great um tweet about this actually so I just pulled this up while you were talking while I was looking for the quote and she said uh famously Jeff Bezos had this stat that made him quit his job what are the generation defining stats of today here's number one here's what she had the cost of mapping a genome has fallen by a hundred thousand percent over the last 15 years so it went from like 100 million dollars to less than a thousand dollars um so mapping genomes if that's true if the cost is dropping like Like a Rock what what could be done off that the second um College tuition has outpaced how much people earn by 10x here's this one chart that uh that shows you know people's earnings over time and the cost of college over time it's like College college going way up that's a one chart business right there cyber insurance loss ratios have increased for years despite exponential growing rates your loss ratio is basically how many claims you have so cyber security is becoming an exponential issue the percentage of men under 30 not having sex has tripled in the last decade so before um men not having sex was like you know 15 now it's 30 of men are not having sex under the age of 30. before the age of under the age of 30. so you just made it nice um yeah um a couple other ones you had in here it used to be that eight hours of sleep was a norm on average now people get 6.8 um so the Sleep industry and the like effects of of not sleeping are gonna go gonna go up um the electronic system in a car was five percent of car costs now it's 50 of car costs um it's not just self-driving cars there's cars are basically rolling computers dude those are brilliant you you like I've I've definitely have started stuff because I've seen things like that I remember sitting with one of the founders of com this guy Alex II and we were at lunch and he just burst out laughing out of nowhere and we were like what he goes I just realized that there must be like 10 million people a day dying on Facebook you know what I guess like Facebook must have so much churn just due to death he's like they probably have millions of users churned because they died every day that's insane and he just starts he starts laughing and you're like hey Alex like you freaking autistic weirdo like he's just laughing so maybe normal he was like can you imagine millions of people turning because they died every day from your product he's like he's like what do they do with those profiles how does that work he's like what there's a team of people just like the morgue at Facebook just cleaning up these dead profiles unless you sign up for afternoon more people died during lunch today than use our product you know like more people on Facebook died than have ever used our product he was just laughing on control yeah you're like yeah that's hilarious Alex that's that's so funny so this is my first time recording back in Austin so basically most Summers between like May and October I go to New York because I have family there and we like to stay there this time we only did it for like six weeks and I'm back and every time I come back I get this immense amount of stress because typically when I go I'll go for three months and I only bring a carry-on so I basically bring um a pair of Crocs a pair of workout shoes and one nice dress shoes and then I bring like two workout shorts two workout shirts and I just clean them regularly Crocs workout shorts a box of Captain Crunch and a switchblade yeah that's called Summer ready with the yo-yo like those little little pager things on my belt yeah I got my Omega my cross it's a bubble gum and I'm good okay so you so why do you say you're stressed out what do you mean you're stressed stressed about what because all right so I I bring nothing basically I bring very little stuff and I rent a furnished place and then I in my book bag I bring two lights for the podcast an extra cell phone that I hang up and that's my camera and this microphone and I come back to my house and I realize I've got a closet full of stuff I've got two cars that I gotta go like all right I gotta make sure that like the battery didn't die I have a motorcycle I got to make sure the battery didn't die the tires are full I've got this cold plunge where I got to go like make sure I filled it with water and I gotta clean it I just have like like there's just stuff there's stuff to like maintain and I saw a picture of our friend sahil and he had his baby uh Roman a beautiful baby but in the back he had literally three barrels they were barrels they were not buckets they were barrels of toys and I see all this stuff that I have now and I'm stressed out about this stuff I've got to go Ranch an hour and a half away I gotta go check in on I have all this stuff and I'm freaking out about having kids about all this other stuff I'm gonna get Sarah's making like a a baby shower registry and I see all this stuff and it's so much stuff it's freaking me out man I don't want any of it and I'm wondering I don't think you freak out over this because I think you you probably have a lot of stuff I got all but I for one and freaking about it have you you don't live lightly at all bro living heavy might be the title of my autobiography living lightly um yeah I indulge uh our kids have tons of crap that's what kids do they they bring a bunch of crap into your house I got a dog dog's not some crap I got some crap there's just stuff everywhere I literally have a ball pit and a tent and a fort and uh like you know I have so much stuff in every single room if you saw this room I'm in right now you would want to like pass out but I gotta say I'm not I'm no therapist but I kind of feel like what you're having is actually um like fatherhood fear and you're just redirecting it misguiding it and pretending that you're worried about the stuff I think this is some underlying life's about to change I'm about to become a parent about to lose my freedom and I think it's expressing itself in some weird ways like when you get hives because you're worried about your math test well I get a little nervous and you might be right but also I get a little bit nervous just about all the stuff I have in general so I was talking to my buddy Dennis and he's got he's a single guy he's got three cars and he's like I have all these cars and like I gotta go like run them to make sure because I haven't driven this thing in a month I gotta go like drive it around I'm like dude it's like we all wanted this and then we all got it and now we realize we just go take care of it and like if I see someone with a Ferrari I'm like man if you get a flat tire that's like a ten thousand dollar like repair to like get that to you where you need to go where you got to repair it and you got to fix it and everything right it just takes so much mental space and so what are you gonna do you're gonna give it all away you're just gonna cry about it what's the situation now the situation is you have to be a conscious consumer I think which is like my woo-woo phrase of the week but basically I have to be really really careful and so I'm going to the baby registry and I'm like if it doesn't like if it's not a book we shouldn't ask for it and we should actually like basically say to people don't buy us anything but like I'm just I'm trying to say or if you want something and they sell at Target you have to walk there and get it other because I don't want all these boxes around the house we gotta like it's isn't it crazy that we buy stuff it comes from Amazon then we have to pay 1-800 got junk to come and we give them 300 to go throw away all the stuff you know what I mean like the boxes it's it's weird so I'm just gonna buy less stuff that's basically what I'm gonna do I think is that not the answer I think you're on the right side of History um although I think with kids is a different game like for example one of the reasons I got a lot of stuff is saying you're on the right side of history is such like a woo-woo way of saying I agree like it's like the right side of history is what like uh political people use you're in the right side of History you know why it works because you're talking about the most minor personal pet peeve so I gotta elevate it by saying you're on the right side of History making it feel a little more Grand okay that's a little trick you don't I think it's weird that you don't experience this I think a lot of people are experiencing this right now and they're and like when you go to some people's homes they they have a basement full of stuff and I'm like dude a cluttered a cluttered room is a cluttered brain in my mind I threw away I hired a guy to come over cleared my calendar I hired a guy to come over and he just took so much crap out of our house uh like we just removed everything out of the garage he took a whole dining table chairs a rug that I didn't like just took loads of stuff away and it felt like you know the satisfaction when you like pop a zit or something like that it felt like that yeah I popped my house this is it it does feel great when you get rid of stuff and you lighten the load but what I would say is one of the reasons I had a lot of stuff I have a lot of stuff as a as a parent is because you end I don't know not everybody does this to better parents than us but we bribe our kids a ton and it turns out that like the thing you want more than like a neat and tidy home and foot light footprint is like 13 minutes of relaxation and you know how you get 13 minutes of relaxation you stop at freaking Dollar General or whatever and you buy some crap that your kid's gonna be excited about playing for like 30 minutes and like that's all you need and you if you have that all right it's worth it we'll get rid of that later and so having stuff that your kids can play with is how you get to be on the internet and if you don't want to be on the internet cool keep your minimal house and you can go and entertain your kids with your bare hands but if you don't want to do that you better buy the ball pit and the slide and the Nugget and like all these little things so that they have stuff in the Target you you've got the target grocery cart exactly check out because then I can say oh let's play grocery store you go shopping and buy everything and I'll be sitting over here on my laptop and then they do it and another nine minutes passes and I'm just nine minutes closer to freedom to the day that they're old enough to go to school and so you know this is uh it's a really it's a tool for survival is what I'm trying to say yeah and the last thing on this is the reason I love going to New York is when I go is because I say like San Francisco and New York where I lived in San Francisco for 10 years you're you're outside of San Francisco now New York as well it's a land of ones and tens meaning everything about that place is either a one out of ten or it's a 10 out of 10. the beauty the energy the excitement 10 out of 10. the crime like seeing the homeless people do stuff like like like feeling like it's a third world country sometimes that's a one out of ten Austin is a land of six and sevens everything's mostly pretty good mostly all the time it's never going to blow you away with inspiration but it's always gonna be like oh this is nice I feel nice whereas you know you walk around the city of New York and like some of the time you're like this makes me feel alive you know like this is like I just like inject the my veins and then the other times you're there you're like I need space I need quiet like I'm freaking out you know what I'm saying and so what I'm trying to figure out is what's a good life is it surrounding yourself with ones and tens or is it surrounding yourself is seven all the time and that's something that I that we're debating at the moment I mean this is that's a big life question what do you think the answer is I don't know yet I don't have to make my decision yet but I was wondering if you've ever thought about that uh I've never thought about it as well as you just put it what I would say is that anytime uh I learned this thing a long time ago which is one choice is no choice right because if you have if you only have one choice that means you really actually have no choice yeah just inertia two bad choices just tells you you need a third choice and so I think what you're actually saying is you need a third choice um like you know the thing that worked for me was live in California but live in The Burbs so you don't have the crime and stuff like that you do lose a little bit on the energy in the like kind of ambition around you but you can kind of hack around that a little bit um so you get kind of the weather the beauty the the sort of the the California Sunshine all that good stuff um without the the downtown San Francisco crime and um you know recklessness lawlessness I think what I'm gonna do and we could wrap up here I think what I'm going to do is I'm gonna we're gonna rent a place for one year in Westport Connecticut never in a million years did I ever thought I'd say I'd live in Connecticut but I met this woman who I'm going to talk about dafina Smith and she goes I like I met her through Hampton and she was like I know what you're going through I went to the same thing we found this place called Westport Connecticut 60 minutes outside of New York City it sounds crazy but come and visit me I went out there and I was like this is nice so I might do Westport Connecticut but I can't believe I might be a Connecticut person but I think that's what we might do speaking of what you want me to talk about her yeah tell me the story uh I met this woman at a Hampton dinner I sat next to her uh basically her name is dafina Smith and her her store or company is called covet in Maine so you can check it out it's a covet like you want something so c-o-v-e-t and then main like hair m-a-n-e are you on the website yeah there's just uh like you know I don't want to go Rick rubin's party but this party that I'm looking at right here looks amazing this is just like beautiful women running through the like just holding hands and running through the sand which is just hilarious dude so check this out so she started out in real estate just doing normal stuff but her parents own a beauty supply uh like store like a brick like a small store and so she starts helping them out and so she starts saying like oh let's create a website and we'll sell hair extensions online um so you I don't know if your wife uses hair extensions my wife does sometimes hair extensions basically it costs sometimes two or three thousand dollars for really fancy ones sometimes cheaper 500 to a thousand dollars and they basically like weave this they're basically like so extra hair into your hair and it makes it look really nice for a woman and she starts selling this online she's like this doesn't really work that well the way the way that I thought it was going to work so instead what she does is she invests around 100 to 150 000 into starting this business and what she does is she starts hollering at different um beauty stores and she creates like an invite system where she's like look we don't have that much inventory and we want to like onboard people effectively uh so you just apply and then if we can like make this happen we'll start setting you out our product and our products is really high quality and then also we can start sending you some customers because we're going to do really good with the marketing we're going to send people who want our particular type of hair and hopefully when you go and get hair you'll tell your friends oh I got this brand of hair you can go to their website and see who deals their stuff well anyway she only has six employees in her first year of business they did four million dollars in revenue and they're in year four or five and they're doing tens of millions in Revenue by year two she was already in the tens of millions uh year four she's doing many tens of millions they have like two or three agents agencies who work for her but only about six full-time people and if you go to their website they're killing it and I was like how what are you doing so well she's like man we host these like meetups where it'll be like tons of uh women who own these beauty supply companies so or like you know like literally a brick and mortar like beauty store and we do like these parties where we like teach them a little bit about how they run their business we'll have speakers who like have best practices and then also like if they happen to want to apply to sell our product we'll do that and that's like basically how they're getting most of their customers and it's a super fascinating company because a it's just a simple ish website I mean it's nothing like crazy fascinating her the uh the hair is of high quality which by the way do you know how they get hair from this no is it donations it's real hair it's usually no it's from it's from India so like there's I guess in certain parts of India it's like holy or something to shave your head or they go to China where you can pay people and they'll cut their hair and you buy their hair from them and so it's real hair and so it's like a process to get like a high quality hair extension but she built this company on on on this on this idea of like going after these hair slots and it's super fascinating because a this is an industry that I knew nothing about and B I actually think things like this could be pretty huge because it cost two or three thousand dollars to get this done in some cases so I forgot I actually went down this Rabbit Hole a long time ago because a guy I did dinner with Once uh you know when I used to host these Mastermind dinners um worked at this company called Maven did you ever hear about this company yeah they they raised too much money I think they raised like 30 million dollars from Andreessen Horowitz and Serena Williams and Jimmy iveen like oh you know every cool person you can imagine and um so they raised all this money and this guy Taylor came to dinner and he was I think like the CEO or something like that they're based in Oakland and he was telling us about this he was like uh is you know basically one guy explaining to like five other guys who've never like done hair extensions about how crazy this business is and he's like yeah like you have these stylists the stylists are basically like you know these kind of like independent contractors people follow them from like Salon to Salon like wherever they're working they're trying to book them and then the stylist has to go and procure the actual hair and so they go to like these warehouses or these wholesalers to go buy the actual hair and then they get the hair from India and I remember going on a YouTube rabbit hole of like how they get the hair from villages in like India or China or places like this because that's where the bulk of the hair gets imported from and how they get paid you know whatever dollars for for their hair and it's like kind of a controversial thing about like you know is this like is it exploitive there's like rumors of like people being forced to do it which is not great um and so there's all kinds of stuff in the supply chain about ethically sourcing the hair and there's some great videos on YouTube about this if you're ever curious I you know I recommend this is like a fun fun Rabbit Hole to go down um I don't know what happened with Maven because I think they raised a lot of money and I haven't heard about them in a long time and um it looks like they raised 40 million more to go into Walmart I mean it looks like there's 76 million in total they've raised 76 million dollars a lot I don't know why and I know no offense to uh to Taylor uh no no offense to Taylor I hope they hope they succeed but there's something about companies with this pattern of like um cool idea usually underrepresented founder going after space that that you know white Tech startups ignore then like raises Mega round from celebrity investors and then you kind of don't hear about the fruit like maybe they raised too much money like too much money can break companies this happened with uh like that Tristan Walker's company like Walker and yeah whatever the Walker Brands they made like a razor for black men to shave their head I think uh yeah or their beard or whatever and I think that was a great idea um I was a great like model but when you raise that much money it puts so much growth pressure on the business it can sometimes break it and so I hope that this didn't break it but um I've just seen this happen several times now start to start to notice a little bit of a pattern yeah it says in a press release that they have they've done it says they did 120 million in Revenue but they phrase it in a way where I think that means the company's life span they've done 120 million in Revenue but yeah it's stupid I think your cap table is like one of the very few things in business that is an irreversible decision it's very challenging to make up for that mistake and so this is why this woman uh dafina like when I met her I was like I started talking to her I'm like are you on social media she's like a little bit but I haven't decided if I actually want to go all in on it and I was like you're if you Google this lady you'll see our names dafina Smith I'm like you you could be you know you could be like a huge deal if you wanted to like you what what do the kids say you got the Riz she's got the wrist she's like this like very charismatic very pretty tall like composed like when I see her talk I'm like oh man you're like a proper CEO like you got the if Factor uh and she's like she's like I don't know if I actually want to be famous or I don't know if I actually want to go hard that way or I'm like well whenever you want to I think you'll kill it and so I saw when she started telling me her story I had no idea that this stuff could be this big and she told me some of the numbers behind it and I was like flabbergasted at this type of business uh yeah that's crazy um so so her model is this kind of like direct to stylus model there's a few other businesses that are like this have you heard of style seat yeah I like style seat uh my wife used it for a little while what exactly is it though there was a period of time where like or this happens a lot in business where there's a period of time where one idea like when an idea works it can work across like a couple of verticals not all verticals but a couple of verticals and if you figure it out it makes sense so there was a time when like uh Mind Body online was getting uh popular is basically like this idea of sort of like directly booking online booking of yoga classes online booking and Pilates classes and then the fact that there was like this rise of the instructor like the celebrity instructor this happens with Peloton it happened with yoga it happened with Pilates there's like people started there people realize that you're not coming for the venue you're coming for the specific instructor and the same thing is true and by the way that that Mind Body Company so mindbody was software for yoga classes originally I think they went public I think it's like a wildly yeah it's like a billion dollar thing um and with very like old school software like it wasn't like slick new fresh blah blah blah um but people started to realize that like same thing it was true for stylists like you don't go to the hair so some people go to the local you know like me my selection of where I'm getting my hair cut is like what is the closest place to me in that moment that I have 30 minutes right like I'm going there yeah yeah which Great Clips is available at the moment who's gonna pick it up Bowl to put on there dude I just got a haircut in L.A I went to this fancy La place because I was this is the nearest place I went in and I sat down and then he started cutting my hair he's like oh what do you want blah blah I was like uh I don't know can you cut my hair like the standard dude cut um I don't even know what it's called and then he's like uh okay I think that's what you're talking about he starts and I go is he fake I go I was like um I was like oh shoot uh because he was going so slow he was like cutting every individual hair with the scissors to like make it awesome and I go actually um different instructions can you give me the best haircut you can in 15 minutes and I was like yeah I only want to be here for like 15 minutes can you just do your best inside a 15 minute time slot and he was like I don't know if I should be offended or like this is exciting it was just like all right 15 minutes he's like can you put a timer on I go yeah and I put a timer on and then this guy like cut the out of my hair for 15 minutes and I was like wherever you're at when you're done let's just call it he's like you can come back later he's like you can come back later today man I'll finish and I was like it's hair it'll be it'll be it'll be there he's like he's like I won't charge you I was like uh you couldn't pay me to come back you know I'm done I don't understand dude I go to these Orthodox guys about my hair I go to these I go to these Jewish guys in Brooklyn and I love them because it's all about efficiency and then I'll end up just sitting down at the chair anyway just be like tell me about it Uzbekistan I want to hear some stories but like I want a place where they're just gonna call me bub and there's gonna be a a handwritten sign that's hopefully misspelled that says haircut 28 beard trim eight dollars like that's what I want like you better have scotch tape in that drawer of yours like otherwise I'm out if you take credit cards I'm out yeah so um anyways I don't know how I got out of that anyway style C made it easy to book a stylist and I think they got valued at one point like at a nearly a billion dollars and Melody the the woman who's been running it she's been doing this for like a decade now um I'm really curious to see how that one that would plays out because she also raised a bunch of money and and kind of was going for it but this this hair salon barber thing is kind of big like I don't know if you've seen Squire that's another billion dollar company in this space what's Squire Squire is the same thing for barber shops so it's basically like Barbershop booking software um so you know it's a it's an app that lets you book you know book your Barber mobile Barbers were always like you know pick up the phone they're cutting someone's hair they pick up the cordless phone they're like yeah come on in uh what's your name and they're like can't even write it down because they're cutting someone's hair at the same time so Squire just kind of like streamlined that process and I think they might do payments as well um so like people providing software to these brick and mortar um like small businesses is really it's a really really hard Niche but when you if you can do it if you can get the product product Market fit the scale is really big because there is a lot of these small frag like it's a giant fragmented market and there's so many of them that if you can actually figure out a product that works on a sales model that works which is the two hard things um these things can be a lot bigger than they sound because it sounds like oh software for hair stylist who cares um well it turns out it's actually there's a lot of them yeah and I would never want to work in that industry because I think it's it does seem impossibly hard but uh if you're into it it can work our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most trms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better let me give you a blue collar side hustle so uh we haven't had one of these Blue Collar side hustles in a while so uh we're bringing it back would you like you like took one flight and you were around Blue Collar people and you got inspired I left my house and I you know I was around somebody who listens to the podcast so uh shout out to brisha she uh owns this amazing restaurant in L.A I don't know if you know this so she listes the Pod and she's like every time you guys shout out you're like four female listeners I'm like yeah that's me like you know I feel so good and then dude a lot of women are offended by that I don't say that anymore I still say it because I say it with with endearment um you know lead I lead into the joke um the problem is the joke's not that funny so you know it it may not be the right thing to lean into but I'm minute um so anyways I go to she has this restaurant in La how did you meet her she had taken my power writing course and um she had volunteered to like I do this thing where I'm like okay show me your website and we do like a live teardown of it and so we had done one of her website uh because she sells these like michelada like drink things um like this kind of like mobile or sorry this little like uh she has like a restaurant but she has like this e-commerce side of her business too so anyways okay I've done a tear down of it didn't pay much attention to it after the fact but Ben um business partner Ben keeps in touch with anybody that I meet he's just like somehow has tabs on everything he's like yo she's blowing up in La I'm like what do you mean it's like she's got this restaurant um she was blowing up like the restaurant's getting really popular her brand is getting really popular she's got a podcast that's getting kind of popular um and he's like yes what's her full name let's get we'll give her a proper shout out what's her full name brisha Lopez okay so uh she and she's got a cookbook like she's kind of like doing her thing she's got a lot of a lot of stuff going on which I think is pretty fun she got a book called Assad of the art of Mexican style grilling by bricia Lopez um I met her and her brother so anyway so she invites us she's like hey you're in L.A you're having meetings anyways come to our restaurant and uh like you know or whatever we come to her restaurant she serves us this amazing meal you know we talk about restaurant owner owner energy she had it she literally has restaurant owner energy like we walked in we're in her place she's like sit down food just starts appearing we're not ordering anything she's literally like making my plate by hand she's like she's like feeding me like I'm a baby she's like try this was it free did you have to pay I wish I could have paid she's like your money's no good here and uh wow the restaurant owner energy was flowing I loved it uh I literally when we walked out our buddy was like wow is that what it's like to own a restaurant and then our other friend was like this is how every entrepreneur makes the mistake of owning a restaurant because they experience the one percent amazing feeling when you host people at your restaurant and not the 99 of actually you know running a hard restaurant so she uh anyways we're hanging out she's like I love the Pod she's like I love the blue collar side hustles and I was like oh yeah I haven't done that in a while she goes I got one for you okay what is it she goes The Lice Lady what are you talking about it's just she goes she goes dude uh she's like I have kids that are in school and um if you ever if anybody in class gets lice everybody has to get checked for lice and not just not just all the kids like your whole family basically has to get checked for lice and she's like I'm thinking of like the pigeon lady in the park who has pigeons all over the place is this I got I was thinking like it's a woman that just has lice all over like hanging out her shoulders and she feeds them crap uh go to like one of these I don't know like lice treatmentla.com it's a mobile lice testing service so what she's what she said was she goes yeah basically somebody inevitably gets licensed School everybody then has to get tested before you you can't come back until everybody gets tested clean certified clean so then you can either go and do it like or if you want them to come to you because it's time consuming to like go and book an appointment somewhere you can basically there's a lice lady you could just text in La you text her and she's like cool I'll come out there it's 300 bucks for me to come out I'll test you and your whole family plus like I don't know 50 bucks a pop or something like that 100 for like your certificates and it's basically like she makes you know like whatever 500 600 dollars for doing this like test for the whole family to get them all cleared and she serves like these like eight districts in L.A and like that's her territory and there's like another lady out on the east side and she serves her territory and they don't cross paths otherwise there's a bit of a showdown and so um she's like yeah this lady's making tens of thousands of dollars a month just booked she's booked out with these lice inspections and lice treatments I was like wow this is awesome this is I mean who would have ever who would have ever thought uh you know like this is amazing because you know she comes over she got to check four or five people in your house and it's a whole it's a whole deal dude and a lot of them have like pretty cute branding this one's called thelacelifters.com and then there's like hairhelpers.com thehairangels.com and they're all just made on like pretty simple WordPress if you go to simpler web they get great they're getting traffic and then uh they've like just crushed it on the Google review and the Yelp review and some of them have like I'm at licelifters.com they have locations in Florida Texas Pennsylvania uh New Jersey it's almost like a like a franchise this is super fascinating this is really fast very cool right like it's uh you know lice Busters here we go you know we'll come get you um it's crazy yeah they they this is like a little model that I think works locally if it works locally you could do it in a bunch of locations if you do it a bunch of locations you could even franchise it out or go Nationwide if you if you really got aggressive with it so I kind of love this this little uh this little blue collar side hustle and it's one of these like hidden in plain sight niches right it doesn't take a genius to uh to pull this thing off dude if you go to licebusters usa.com the one you're on I mean I made that up by the way is there actually oh yes I just Googled lifebusters licebusters usa.com they have a couple dozen locations uh no this is a really a super fascinating thing um yeah this is cool how much does it cost to have a lice Buster come to your school I bet you it's like a thousand dollars for the day or something none of them yeah exactly none of them do like clear pricing on their website which is how you know it's kind of a rip um but like you know they got you in a hard spot too right it's like a locksmith right they come over they're like well um uh this is a 1988 it's got to be an extra five hundred dollars you're like well am I really gonna tell you to go home call another locksmith to price compare like impossible right like no one no one has more power on Earth than a locksmith when they're at your house like it is over you know you know that's like a huge scam right have you ever read about locksmith so I knew this guy from Israel who ran one of these things and he was like if you Google locksmith Nashville he's like there's like eight of the ten listings on Google they're all different branding I own all of them and I basically like I have like indentured servants so I got like my friends who come in from Israel I say you have to work for me for two years and he basically sends him leads and the name of the game is you go to the person's house you tell them it's 200 on the phone you actually charge them 400 and it's like known for being one of the most Shady things there is it's the locksmith industry have you not like ever heard of it I've never never been an honest locksmith uh guy comes to my house he's like ah you know first he takes it forever and it's like basically takes so long that you're like by the time this gets there you're already worn out it's like a negotiation without him even being there and then it's too late to call somebody else you just want to get into your damn car or your house and then they show up and they're like uh this is gonna be trickier because the um this is a house yeah of course it's a house it's like yeah it's got studs so it's going to be and I'm like study what are you talking about bro he's like oh like this oxygen in the air uh I'm gonna have to charge it for that and oh it's made out of wood and literally what happened the last locksmith guy came and he tried to charge us 600 and then we were like no way just out of principle no way you stand here I'm gonna break this door down with my shoulder and get it repaired for double looksie like all right fine 100 bucks no he stood there and he watched us break the door down with our shoulder and then we paid 1200 to get the door repaired um I gotta tell you it never felt more satisfied paying the 1200 because that sheet didn't get my money what did he say what did you smash the door down very Alpha of you you were just laughing well dude imagine the intent imagine the moment of anticipation when I'm about to charge and I've only ever seen the in movies I have no idea how much Force this is going to take and if this fails if I get slam into this yeah I hurt my shoulder and fall down the absolute worst case scenario now we gotta pay this guy and I gotta go to Kaiser instead it's like I must get through this wall and like you know like moms can lift cars when their children are in need like my ego was trapped and I had to break this door down there was no other option and of course I came through in the clutch um so you know it ended up working out after two or three solid Banks the key was I didn't fully commit to the first one I gave it like a tester just kind of like uh yeah I'm gonna do it over here on the side and like when we get to the edge not a middle middle is the way to go right like where's the point of weakness I can see you standing there like looking at your figure to see which way which way the winds blowing like it's just like calculating I got a piece of chalk and you like do a little math to figure out like where the best like point of entry is yeah just doing things to stall I just like took my shoes off like I don't know why like I was just hold on I'm just thinking like okay what am I gonna do to get this door down and you like warm up your heads I don't know why I needed to perform for this guy like I could have just told him to leave and done it in my privacy but I had told him like that's a rip-off I'm gonna break this door down all right so let me tell you um this is actually a good segue to a topic I wanted to talk to you about I didn't know how we would work this in but it worked out perfect God so there's this phrase that I love which was um I'm looking for that I'm looking for AAA Locksmith AAA Locksmith what's a triple A laxman so back in the day when they had the phone Pages people would the Yellow Pages people would go to like find a service like locksmith and um it's like doing four four minute abs instead of seven minute abs you know you gotta yeah exactly you could differentiate on many things you could say we're a locksmith uh company we're honest we have we have good pricing we are a lot nobody knows that they're just looking at the Yellow Pages they don't know how to find you find out anything more about you they're just going to go based on which locksmith stands out guess who stands out the most the one at the top and so I call it the Triple A locksmith idea because people started to game the system they're like oh instead of calling themselves Smith's locksmiths like then they're far down the list they would call themselves right a locksmith and then some other guy was like no no we're double A locksmith so A A Locksmith they would show up first in the like the list some other guy comes in he's like no no I'm AAA Locksmith AAA Locksmith because they're going to be first on the list because actually that's all that matters first on the list is going to get 80 of the dials and so I love this ex this story because it showed me like you want somebody who like I always said when we were hiring Engineers I want to hire AAA locksmiths which is somebody who could do the job on the engineering side but they have just enough of their mind just 10 15 of their mind is going to think about hey how do I get more customers oh if I just put two A's in front of my name I'll be at the top of the list dope I'll do that that that that immigrant it's like that immigrant hustle yeah exactly so I want the engineer that's got just enough of that that little that moment of micro hustle where they just figure out oh this little thing is going to help me you know help me get a little bit further in life so I was thinking about these micro hustles because again I left the house start to observe things start to notice how broken some Industries are so I'm out of dinner how long were you gone for five days an eternity okay um I go to dinner and uh sitting with some friends and the this happened five times so we went to dinner every single night while we were out while I was in delay every single night the same thing happened at dinner we eat at the end waiter comes up and he says um can I get you guys a dessert menu dessert anybody want dessert dessert and then you know his voice is going up like a hot air balloon and then everybody at the table awkwardly looks around I you want did you want any did you want dessert I'm good that's a that's a that's a rookie waiter move you set the you just set it down even if you just set it down the same sort of thing so I said I said okay what's the micro uh and and so I was thinking about I was like what's the micro hustle move here if I'm a wave so I'm looking for these moments where you because I meet a lot of people that are like love the Pod um yeah I want to do my own thing someday but currently I just have this job and like the gap between the current job and running their own successful company feels large in their mind and here's the way to shrink that Gap well the real way to show with The Gap is just do it but let's say you you're not just doing it yet yeah teach me about some teach me about some shrinkage let's go yeah you're an expert maybe you should actually explain this yeah yeah yeah preaching to the choir here so I'm like how do you start to think like a business owner think like a little bit of an of a hustler when you're in your job find the moments where you can hustle inside inside your job and I'm not talking about pitching your boss an idea I'm talking about just going rogue and making some happen learning how to be a triple A locksmith how to use human psychology to your advantage so the last dinner I see this guy and this guy's a little more clever one guy he goes he takes instead of instead of saying dessert menus anybody want dessert should I bring a dessert menu um and instead of just putting down dessert menu and then hoping for the best this guy comes to me at the side of the table he goes um he goes he goes all he goes I'll leave this with you to order dessert for the table nice oh that was smooth as a mother and I was like wow like I guess I am the head of the table though the man of the house I do need to provide for my my friends here you know I do need to to give them an experience and he just whispered it to me like this is our little secret you just tell me what you tell me what you want we'll we'll surprise him so I was like that was a smooth move and I started thinking what could go even further and so I started everywhere I was going I started brainstorming this little micro hustle moment so then even with this dessert thing I said who would make it more fun I said what if what if they actually set down a thing because most people when it comes to dessert they it looks like there's two answers yes or no but there's actually a third answer do you know the third answer when it comes to dessert no what I'll have some if you want some that's actually where everybody lands it's like yeah I'll do one if you're doing one right like this is how people feel with things and so I I thought somebody should actually just set down a little thing in front of everybody say all right here's a restaurant at the end of the meal there's three little buttons I could put in front of you button number one no thanks I'm fine button number two hell yeah butt number three I'll have one if everyone else wants one and uh on three we do our reveal we make it fun you do the reveal if anybody says yes and anybody says I'll have it if everyone else is having it say no more would you guys like the brownies or the truffles oh okay truffles yeah let's go and you could get I think you could add on like forty dollars to every ticket if you just did it this way dude I love I love those games like that it's like it's like In and Out secret menu yes you know what I mean like I love these games at restaurants that's my favorite and I think a lot of life is just played in your head and if you're just sitting somewhere the challenge I give everybody is how do you play a little game in your head today where you say all right let me add a little Showmanship let me add a little restaurant owner energy to what I'm doing right now let me add a little psychology to what I'm doing right now and if you do that every day you become a different person like I fully believe this you literally become a different person and you have more fun versus just going through the motions as you were before so this is my little rant on finding that little micro hustle uh being the guy who figures out how to do the dessert menu in a way that makes everybody feel good and actually gets you everyone gets everyone eating dessert because there's a version of that for your job whatever your job is the mini Riz the little mini Riz you did this at the hustle we talked about when you did the uh everybody gets a hundred dollars let's go to Costco and let's see who gets the best thing right like it was it was the best yeah that was our team building activity was we had I think we had 12 employees we gave everyone 50 bucks we said you can team up you can do it on your own but at the end we're gonna vote we're gonna have three characters or three Awards which is most useful gift your favorite gift and the most tasty gift and you have to try to win one of those Awards yeah and I love these stories of people who just take the ordinary and uh and sort of like add a little extra to make it extraordinary all right anyways that's my rant who who are you at dinner with or who'd you go to LA with and did you did anything amazing happen a lot of so many amazing things happened I wanted to actually write my notes and send them to you so that then we could do an episode just bring breaking the whole thing down because there was so much uh so much were you recognized a lot do you get recognized not at all actually really LA's got real actual famous people so um maybe people don't know that you're like six one I think because a lot of people I think would be surprised how tall you are when I go to La I mean I get stopped a dozen times a day uh I think I maybe I just stick out more than you do maybe but it could be uh I'm shocked by that or you're just super unapproachable which I could see that as well yeah I think that's actually more of it um I must have just like you know whatever resting face or something because uh yeah nobody's really coming up to me that much it happens actually here in the Bay Area but when I was in LA I don't think it happened one time so that was good uh you know you're not from L.A no I mean like but okay humble not a famous fruits yeah where uh who'd you go you went with Ben probably suly anyone else uh no it should be in band went and then Sully lives down there so he joined us for half the trip well I want to hear all about it so I guess we'll have to wait uh I got some other quick ones I wanna I wanna hit you with some some quick hitters so this is I'm gonna call this my weird AI tool of the week I don't know if this is gonna be a recurring segment but it might be because a lot of weird AI tools so click this link there's a company right now in YC that is called Roundtable roundtable.ai and I saw this post on hackard news um it wasn't the most popular post but I found it and I uh I thought it was fascinating so this guy goes because that's what you do that's what you do you got to find you find the guys exactly so I was I was I was deep with the bag and I found something so um they've posted this lube video that says hey check this out we are round table we use AI to simulate surveys and they go um they go you know research user research and market research is really important but it's expensive takes time to design and analyze and run this run the research so here's what we do we use AI to simulate a survey and they go yeah basically like llm's the new tech that's behind like chat GPT is great at um simulating what something something like a human would say and these years just took it to the entryway so they go you write a survey with a bunch of questions you define your audience like I want people who are um 45 years old or older right and uh so you could say um for example are you interested in buying an e-bike um and it would say yes is answered 28 of the time but if you narrow it down you say let me filter only people who own a Tesla now yes it's 52 of the time and you know for example if you say um where do you where did you learn to code um okay you could ask that question people will say one thing but if you say how old are you if you say only 45 years old or older then everybody will say books if you say younger than 45 70 76 of people say online um and so you know it's kind of crazy that basically like and you can say what what's the most important factor for you choosing an airline to fly and like five percent of people would say leg room but if you filter it say people who are six feet or taller it jumps to 20 of people saying legroom and so I saw this and I was like what the hell like does this defeat the purpose of the survey like you're literally just gonna make up the answer and give it to me but then I guess humans are actually a lot more predictable than we think that this thing is trained on like the entire internet's data set and I just thought this was remarkable and I couldn't believe like is this actually going to be the case that you can actually just AI could just fake answer your surveys and tell you do your user research for you doesn't that sound absolutely bizarre so it's not there yet because one person he goes hey look I had I ran a survey I said was the moon landing fake option A yes option b Moon 94 of people voted Moon and but that said uh I actually do think the same results would actually come if you actually asked people that exact same question like most people would be like oh you know what I mean like oh I think I know what you're saying you're saying you meant to put yes there uh so but but this is like a really thought-provoking idea yeah and honestly I haven't even spent enough time like actually figuring out like is this literally a joke or is this like the next big thing if that's kind of interesting anytime you get something that's like either it's satire this was actually started exactly or it's genius it's like you driving around being like ah it I'll be a taxi did I ever tell you about the time that I ran um the Disco by the way that's not how Uber started just in case you didn't know one man just deciding I'll be attacked but did I tell you that I used to do that no so one for two two new years in a row My Buddy Joe and I we rented a zip car Minivan and we wore if if you Google this you'll see photos of me doing this we wore fake afros and disco clothes I'll try to find it but we had the it was called the um Disco Frisco Taxi and we would drive around uh if you look up disco Frisco taxi you'll see my name you'll see disco taxi and we would drive around being like hey guys where are you going you want to go to this place all right cool how about uh 30 bucks and they would say all right cool they would get in they'd be like all right you entered in the Disco Frisco taxi spin the wheel you can win a juice box brought to you by the makers of the touchy feely wheelie which is the thing I do Monday through Friday yeah it's like all right your destination is my house my home all right yeah let's go because it's New Year's and they're like desperate and we would be like how about 50 bucks and they would say all right cool uh and so we would bake like a thousand dollars a night on New Year's I was it was the Disco Frisco taxi so serious I don't remember where I'll be even going with this but uh yeah Round Table cool into it um really good really good I like that where do you want to go from here we wrapping up uh yeah let's wrap it up all right that's the Pod we done [Music] foreign [Music]

they gave xqc a reported two-year 100 million dollar contract what so that means that this guy's making more than LeBron James playing for the Lakers this year and crazier than that is that he doesn't have to stop streaming on Twitch he can still stream on Twitch right and so when you first hear this this sounds crazy it's like you signed a non-exclusive 100 million dollar deal for some kid in his bedroom playing video games that sounds insane and then they did that with a bunch of other streamers so a bunch of other streamers are also making 10 million 20 million 30 million dollars a year to stream on Kik right now and the big question is will this strategy work

and when you see a big company like 1800 flowers or hkin so a company that has millions of customers when they say one or two lines like that that gets me really [Music] interesting all right we're live Sean is not here so I'm going to do a question and answer session I tweeted out that I'm going to be doing this and we have a bunch of questions Jonathan's going to be reading uh the first ones what are they which where do you want to start all right this one is from Jimbo slice at J gilly3 he goes would love to learn how to develop ideas for businesses to start and how to test said ideas so basically because of this podcast I have to research cool companies but what a lot of people don't know is I've been doing research on companies before I worked on this podcast before I started this podcast and this is how I created the hustle we ended up selling the hustle for tens of millions of dollars and this is how I created Hampton which is going to be a huge company I think and I've done a bunch of other little projects based off this research model um I'll do a quick plug basically if you go to ideation bootcamp.com everyone kept asking me about this process so I like made it into a course you can go and buy it if you want I'll just kind of give you a little preview now I've got this way of researching where I look for five or six different things and it's almost like the way that I compare it to a song so there's a song called uh uh you know like a Guns and Roses song like Welcome To Paradise is that what it's called Sweet Child of mind that's what I'm thinking Sweet Child Of Mind Sweet Child of mind has this amazing guitar solo uh in that song and the the band said that they someone asked them how they write songs they're like well sometimes like which Sweet Child of Mine I heard this uh amazing guitar riff that slash was tinkering with and I wrote lyrics around it and then we created the bridge and the hook and whatever other times I've got this really cool oneliner this lyric we're going to turn it into the song I do the same thing with business and so those little hooks that I look for are the first thing is demand so I'm constantly seeking out what problems people have uh the second thing is I'm constantly looking at uh how many people share that particular problem and I'm going to give examples of all this the third thing I look at is who are the leaders in that space so what's succeeding and why the fourth thing I look at is of the leaders and the people in the space What shortcomings do they have next I look at which business models are most effective and then finally I look at what problems AR being solved and I'm going to give you an example of this and so I have all these tools that I use and so like here's a here's an example so there's there's this company called 1800 flowers and um it's a phone service where you call and you order flowers and I was just like probably buying Valentine Day flowers on their website one time and I noticed that their traffic I use this tool called similar web I use that all the time it's a plugin it's free they have a paid version the free version is totally fine they have this plugin where it tells you a guesstimate of what the traffic is from a website and 800 Flowers as predicted it had like pretty great traffic like it was like five million people a month coming to the website and then in February it like peaked to be really really big that's easy to guess because it was Valentine's Day but basically it was that told me that wow A lot of people are using- 1800 Flowers on a regular basis and it peaks in February and it also uh had a big jump in uh um whenever Mother's day is May or June and so I was like all right that's interesting I kind of knew that but let me read a little bit more about this and so I use another tool called annual reports.com and I love reading annual reports because it teaches me about the company so an annual report if a company is public they have to release this quarterly report where they talk about their earnings and all these interesting things about the company and a lot of time they appear boring but I'm reading them to find insight and I found this one Insight that said we are noticing that the the succulent plant it's a very particular plant we are noticing that amongst our Millennial consumers it's the fastest growing trend I also did this with hinin the company hinin they in their annual report they said um hinin zero so which is like a non-alcohol version they are uh it's our fastest growing segment it's still really small but it's fast growing and when you see a big company like 1800 flowers or hkin so a company that has millions of customers when they say one or two lines like that that gets me really interested when they say something's fast growing I'm like oh I'm intrigued and so I'll read these reports just for looking for one or two lines that say that or I'll use I'll go to like every website I go to if it's like really weird looking um and it grabs my attention I go to a similar web and I just look at what the traffic is because I'm looking for these one little tidbits that catch my attention and in this case for the 1800 Flowers it they said succulents were were growing and so I'll look at um you know what they say and and and then I try to find shortcomings so with- 1800 flowers they said that their shortcomings are they uh that most of their revenue comes from holidays and so they're trying to get revenue and business between the holidays to make their business more steady they also said that I believe this was a few years ago they said that most of their profit comes from not the flowers but from vases so that has the biggest margins and they also said uh that they were trying to think of ways to get people to buy more accessories like vases chocolates and things like that and then um so that kind of like gave me this idea of like okay 1800 Flowers is a big business because the revenue is huge and it gets tons of traffic I know that so that's like proving me that there's demand and a big audience I know that they're succeeding at least to some point because they're a publicly traded company and they're very profitable I know the shortcomings or the problems that they're trying to solve for are that they uh can't get people to buy stuff on a regular basis and they want people to buy more vases so what other problems are consumers not being uh not do consumers have that aren't being solved and where is800 flowers failing well in my head I was like well if you could figure out a way to get people to buy regularly with different vces how can I do that and so I wrote this report for Trends trends.co and then someone eventually launched a company where they created this succulent plant that you like smack on the wall and it it's like has this like hydroponic system ponic system where it like it like watered itself and then there was another company that launched and they and they created the coolist it was a succulent plant and some of them launched these companies based off that report I wrote company created this uh business where they had these like amazing pots and vases where it had like artists on there so like freed toal was on one or they would create like really funny pots and plants like some of the pots were like State themed so like an organ plant like had had like an organ flag on the vase like things like that and that was their way of solving it and a bunch of these companies a few of them went on to raise millions and millions of dollars I think there's bloomscape and I forget the other one but it basically came from this like research methodology of finding demand finding the audience looking at the leaders the shortcomings and it's this like cycle that I use and I try to find like one hook or one line for each of those things that get me interested so I use similar web a ton to do that so I look at where someone's getting a lot of traffic or how much traffic is getting there's another amazing thing called company house it's a so basically if you're based in the UK and you're a company that does at least 10 million in Revenue you have to file your um your uh financials and so if I find a cool company that uses the word LTD I guess that means like limited company if I find a company that does something like that has that on their website I immediately go to company's house so for example I found this amazing website that basically basically was reviewing um VPN you know what a VPN is it's like a a thing that hides like where you are when you're using the web and they had like 12 million visitors to their site and I was like oh that's interesting and the company was called like something company name LTD so I go all right I'm going to go straight to company's house and see what the revenue is their revenue was like18 million and their profit was like 16 million and so that told me that a there's demand for people who want to uh get reviews for VPN that shocks me I didn't realize that market was that Big B it shows me that that business model of affiliate so they made money through affiliate so they would write a review on a um they would write a review on a VPN if someone bought it they got a little cutback that business model super fascinating so in my head I'm like oh wow what other Tech products are have this big affiliate fees and can I create content for them that business model was really fascinating and see I learned that they were the leader in the space and so like that just like opened up my mind to like a different business model and a different Niche and I didn't do anything with that but I thought to myself man I wonder if I could do this for payroll software I wonder how many people are having payroll software problems uh I bet you get a big affiliate fee with that I bet you I could rank on search for that and then I never end up doing it because I wasn't passionate about it but anyway I go through all these different examples and of like these different tools that I use to research on adiation boot camp it's adiation boot camp. but that's like a very scattered example of how I do that all right this one is from Mike terella he asks about the evolution of your health Journey while being an entrepreneur he goes I've been lifting to get back in shape and just curious of lessons or future roadblocks to watch out for so this is around fitness and health so let me give you guys some background so I was an exceptional High School athlete I was one of the best in the state of Missouri where I'm from at the 200 meter and 400 meter dash and then I went to a division one school where I was a scholarship athlete for two years and then I quit and I got into business and between the ages of 20 to about 28 I was fat I was pretty lumpy and I was was pretty disgusting now is a good time to put the my before picture so if you're on uh listening to this on audio you can go ahead and see you can go to our YouTube and see those pictures but I got pretty fat and I got disgusting and then about three or four years ago I said this is it I'm going to get my act together and I'm going to become a fitness model that's what I said it was a joke I'm not actually that but it was a joke and I did it I got pretty fit and so I basically created this rule uh General matys he's this uh General in America he's got this great line it says figure out your flat ass rules and stick to them and the reason being and I sawo this from Ryan holiday who's inspiration to me he said the person who decides every day uh what choices they have to make for each decision that person will be exhausted and burnt out and so about when I was 29 28 years old I made the decision that I will never ever ever miss a workout and so at first I basically created programming for myself which means I created my own schedule my own lifts and like how much I should lift I did that on my own for a little while and then I hired a trainer his name is Jesse O'Brien at Central athlete I think you go to Central athlete.com you can see him I'm not affiliated I'm just a fan and he created all my training for me and I meet with him monthly and I do the workouts remotely but basically I don't miss a single workout and I have uh I work out five days a week and I so that's five days times 52 I think that's 260 workouts in the last two years three years I've probably have missed five 5 to 10 a year and that's usually only because of sickness or like if someone dies and I have to take a flight to a funeral but basically 95% of the time I don't miss and so I believe big big big in Big Time into consistency so I don't miss the second thing that I do and by the way that like that I'm fairly extreme about it so for example uh I drive a ton so like when I go on I take tons of road trips when I take a road trip and I can't get my workout in the morning before I leave I pull over on the side of the road and I tell Jesse today's a travel day I'm going to be driving and I bring uh bands with me and I pull over on a truck stop I got lots of pictures and videos of me sending my wife saying uh I'm at this particular truck stop I'm doing push-ups burpees Sprints things like that I will pull over on the side of the road for an hour and do it I do not miss workouts the second thing that I do is I set very specific goals so each quarter I have a new goal so those goals have included like I wanted to bench press 330 PBS and I wanted to squat 430 PBS and I I'll take a quarter sometimes two quarters to get there the next time I've had a goal of doing a combine and I wanted to score average for an NFL receiver uh which I think was like a 4540 a 34 inch vertical a 104 broad jump and then bench pressing 225 pounds times 16 times I think whatever it was I pick goals every quarter and I stick to them because I I need to have a goal I don't always hit my goal sometimes I most of the time I do but I but I I always have a goal that I'm trying to do for me right now and I imagine for the rest of my life it's going to all be centered around weightlifting because a I want to live to like I'm 130 and there seems to be a strong correlation between living long and uh having muscle like because it I can just not break my hip when I fall because my bones will be stronger and I can get up when I get hurt um and also B because I want to look good naked I'm vain so that's why I do it so I lift a ton of weights and I have a coach that tells me what to do and I basically don't question them I o use my body tutor no affiliation with them other than I've become friends with them and that helps me with my dieting so I spend roughly $300 a month on training and I think $250 a month on my body tutor it's basically a nutritionist they call me once a week and they keep me on track and then finally I write down everything I eat and I write down every workout so I use an app where I track all of my workouts uh because I want to know what I did the previous week so I can improve and then I track everything I eat because it's really easy for me to overeat and so tracking it helps me um this person asked um um what future roadblocks will be everyone I don't have a kid yet I but we are pregnant everyone says that that will be a roadblock I'm in a very fortunate situation where I've been able to hire some help like a night nurse and things like that I have a feeling that it won't be a roadblock but I it will be more challenging but it's not going to prevent me did I answer that question yeah for sure all right this one is from John Murphy at Ecom CEO he asks when to embrace shiny object syndrome and when and how to keep it under control this is a great question and this is something that I think holds back 90% of people from really big success so I constantly ask myself what can I do this week this month this year what can I accomplish in a certain time period that will make every other task not important and so there's this idea of like procrastination Paul Graham wrote this great article if you Google Paul and procrastination he talks about there's actually good procastination there's bad procastination procastination The Bad type is um you're just not going to you just don't start working but the good type is that it's like the idea of this crazy scientist who's a genius and he forgets to shower or he forgets to wear two uh matching socks and the idea being is you can actually ignore most things as long as you're getting the big things right and so I ask myself all the time what is that one thing that I want to accomplish most people they try to jump from thing to thing to thing because something's not working or because they feel pressured into doing something I actually think that you should do one thing for an extended period of time the reason being is because every time I say yes to something I'm ultimately saying no to something else and that means I'm saying if I'm saying yes to a new project I'm saying no to either things like family time or I'm saying no to focusing on the thing that matters or I'm saying no to having like I'm basically giving worry uh or uh worry time and I'm giving uh space in my brain for something that isn't essential and so saying no is really important it's very uncomfortable but I think it's necessary I think most people do multiple things at one time because they are guilted into it because what they see online um and I try to remind myself that I don't care about another person's opinion more than I care about my own opinion and also most people don't know what they're doing and so I'm not going to put too much judgement on their opinion because they don't have any idea what they're doing I also try to remind myself that strong men they don't like give into fear and I think a lot of people have shiny object syndrome because they're fearful that their main thing's not going to work I try not to give into fear of course I'm human I do every once in a while but I try my hardest not to do it and so I think that when you're starting a business because this is a business podcast we'll talk about that I I have to ask myself well I wish that I have stuck with this in 10 years while I look back and say I wish I would have done this one thing and if the answer is consistently yes then I'm going to stick to that one thing that said it's definitely an art to figure out what to say no to and when to bail on what's working but I've met a lot of successful people and I've noticed that the people that have huge outside outsized results and have massive massive wealth it typically comes from one thing and then once they get incredibly successful it appears as though they have a lot of things going on but those lot of things are like 5% of the 100% when it comes to net worth creation so I have to remind myself on a regular basis that big results typically come from one thing and the people who appear to be be to be doing a lot of things they actually kind of are doing one thing one of my good friends Andrew Wilkinson he owns a private Equity company or he owns a thing called tiny where they buy businesses and so he owns technically like 40 businesses but his one thing is buying companies or investing and so you have to remind I have to remind myself that's his one thing and he's doing that well and that's what makes everything else work additionally he also had one agency metal lab for I think 12 years and then he started investing into other companies and so you have to make your one thing work otherwise the rest of the stuff doesn't really work out and so I think more people should focus even though it's quite challenging and it doesn't appear as fun I think gets better results okay this one is from Gabe Fina gabf on Twitter he asks how to be interesting as a podcaster you're essentially a professional Entertainer what are the key skills you've learned over the years that allow you to be entertaining to listen to and talk to this question is I think particularly interesting for young men single men because when I was a single guy when I was 14 15 and 16 well basically until I was not single all I cared about was meeting girls and what I learned and I wasn't very good at it arguably was never great at it but I I improved the best thing for meeting a partner was to be an interesting person I imagine this works for women as well but I only know a man's perspective it works awesome for men it's to be interesting um I made a few points about how to be interesting at least what I think how would be interesting because I like figured this out I wasn't like good at this the first thing is that you have to find something that interests you and you have to turn it into a passion even if it's not popular the reason being is people like people who uh are passionate about stuff and who are really great at explaining why they're passionate about things and they don't need to be popular things so for a long time I'm I I was really interested in denim that's like a hobby of mine I loved jeans because jeans are part of American history and I would like buy like $500 or $1,000 jeans just to store them and keep them and only wear them occasionally because they're historical and important to me I was really really really fascinated in that and I noticed that when I would meet a girl and I would say something like hey I'm going to this uh swap meet they got really cool denim just having something to do and like being passionate about it it attract she was more attracted to me because of it and then my male friends as well were like oh this sounds interesting you just got me interested in this topic I'll go with you and you can explain it to me and thus people were attracted to me this works for business for meeting someone whatever right now it's Fitness I'm super fascinated in Fitness and having like a goal and having something I care about I've noticed people are drawn to me the second one is when I cons I consume a ton of information so I listen to podcasts I um watch a lot of TV like documentaries I read a lot of books and I read Wikipedia every night I love Wikipedia and when I'm consuming information I consume it from the perspective of I try to find a hook so I'll hear like or I'll read something on Wikipedia and I try to find a fascinating hook and I think in my brain how can I retell this that can capture people's attention and whenever I consume information that's what I do so for example I just watched the documentary on Arnold schw Schwarzenegger and he has this great line where he calls the Shmi which basically means so like when he was talking about being the spokesperson for supplement brands or whatever or uh whining and dining people he goes I got the shme I know how to like grab people's attention I'm just bullshitting with them I got the gift to and he told the story of the shme and I remember hearing that line I go that's brilliant the shme I'm going to talk about that all the time I love the shme and that was that one little line I took from that documentary and I'm going to retell that story all the time I'm going to talk all about the Shmi and so whenever I consume information I'm just or a comedy show or anything I just look for like lines or hooks of a story that I'm going to retell to people constantly I'm going to steal it basically that's it it's I consume information as if I have to write a book report at uh at another time the third thing is I ask people all the time and I ask them this in a very non-judgmental way and a lot of people aren't used to being asked this but I basically ask them all the time whenever they I'll ask them about what they do for work or um where they're from or whatever and they'll say something and they'll say an opinion and I always ask them why do you think that and I always try to ask that because it gets people to open up and when I ask them all about themselves there's this uh great book uh called How to Win Friends and Influence People and Dale Carnegie wrote it in the 19 1920s and he says this tells a story about this kind of nobody young guy talking to this big shot executive and the nobody guy the young guy he asked the big shot executive all about himself and the executive spends 95% of the conversation talking all about himself the young guy spends 5% of the conversation at the end of the conversation the executive goes wow you're a great conversationalist and the truth is that that's because people love to talk about themselves and so often times when I with new people I'll ask them questions like why do you think that or why do you do that or questions like that these open-ended questions and that gives them an opportunity to talk about themselves and thus they think that I am more interesting because ultimately they find themselves probably more interesting than anyone else another thing is I have tried really hard to learn how to tell stories my partner on this podcast Sean Pur he's one of the best storytellers uh I've seen um I've tried to learn from him and I've tried to tell stories and I'll retell the same stories to different groups of people as if I'm a comedian and I like to see what hits and what doesn't and sometimes I'll alter the the story while keeping the truth in there but I'll alter the story in the way I tell it in order to C capture their attention the last two things are I am constantly trying to improve myself which is great because to be interesting you just make yourself better so I'm constantly trying to improve myself and I explain to people what I'm trying to do so for example if I'm trying to get fit if I'm trying to read a certain amount of books if I'm trying to uh build a business I'm always trying to improve myself and I talk about that with people not in an obnoxious way but I let them know and they find that interesting I found most of the time and then finally I say my opinion and I usually research opinions that I have so for example it could be like political stuff it could be Health stuff it could be in business I try to come up with wellth thought out opinions and I'm very uh not afraid to say that opinion and even if it rubs people the wrong way I have found that when you explain your opinion and you stand firm on it uh it you people find you interesting because most people are vanilla and they don't have strong opinions and so that said I'm still open-minded I think there's a phrase what's that phrase it's uh strong beliefs loosely held and so I'm I can be swaye for sure but I TR I have strong opinions and I try to let people know about them and then when I don't have an opinion or I haven't researched a topic I try my hardest to say I've not thought about that or I don't know um and so that's how I think you be interesting when we have different podcast guests come on even if they're not in my world at all because I like consume so much information I'm pretty good at relating to them and that is just comes down to I just read a ton of Wikipedia and when they talk I'll reference things in that field even if I don't know a ton about them and then I'll ask them why they think that because I read on Wikipedia that this this and this um is that true for you is does that uh is that one of the reasons why you think X Y and Z and say no actually or Yes actually and that's a great way to get them to talk more about it and it gets me involved in the conversation our software is the worst have you heard of HubSpot see most crms are a cobble together mess but HubSpot is easy to adopt and actually looks gorgeous I think I love our new CRM our software is the best HubSpot grow better all right so I back channeled a few questions this one is from your buddy Neville madora Neville madora on Twitter and he wanted to hear a bit about your loyalty to your dog Sid he had a quote to share that I thought was pretty great he goes I remember Sam vividly saying I hate when people give away their pets when you sign up for a dog you sign up for life so Neville wants to hear a bit about your relationship to Sid and just if you could elaborate on that quote a bit Yeah so basically I have this dog named Sid I got him when I was 20 or 22 or something he's 14 14 years old now and I do crazy stuff for this dog like for example I live half the year sometimes in New York and sometimes I'll fly sometimes I'll drive but if I fly I hire a driver for him so I basically hire someone to drive him from Austin all the way up to New York and like I don't travel because of him uh overseas typically um and so the reason being is I mentioned uh having rules another rule in my book is responsibility and loyalty so there's a few people in my life my wife my dog my business partner Joe Sean's one of these folks uh Jordan the CEO of Hampton I firmly believe that you never ever ever speak badly about them behind their back you don't lie um you don't disrespect them publicly you don't question them publicly and I try my hardest not to do that even a little bit the reason being is uh I'm a firm belief in loyalty and so uh there's I basically have zero loyalty to most people and then there's like eight people in my live my life who I like I can like write them down and site them I will do anything for them and I expect them to do that for me the second reason is for responsibility so like when I have a meeting on my calendar I try my hardest never ever ever to be late I try very hard to be early I don't miss things if I say I'm going to do something I do it I'm a big firm believer and you do what you say and uh following through and so another rule is when you have a responsibility you stick with it no matter what when I got my dog I said I'm G to raise them right and uh I'm gonna like respect this this like bond that we have and so I'm crazy about that so that's a rule that I just don't break is loyalty and uh rules love it all right this one is from Garretts his handles ggs I II and he goes finding someone to build a company with or finding your first hire so basically he's just asking how you hire people so I'm not like a religious person but there's this uh thing from the Bible I went to Catholic School my whole life there's this like line from the Bible where like Jesus is trying to like get disciples and he tells one of his disciples Peter and Paul he goes like I think they're fishermen and he goes come join me and you are going to be Fishers of Men uh and I love that line um that's an example by the way of being interesting you just find like interesting lines and you you know you retell them there that's a beautiful line and the way that I'm able to um hire good CEOs and hire great people I mean if you look at the hustle I don't know how many people we had when we sold the company maybe 40 so we probably have hired 60 or 70 people a lot of them are really successful now like we hired them when they were like 23 and a lot of them maybe like 15 or 20 of them have went on to start successful companies help grow other successful companies have a name for themselves and the reason they did that is I wanted to be a collector of people Fishers of Men that's a weird line I call it collector of people so I I worked really hard at collecting people and so when I find someone that's interesting to me um I try to make a mental note of who they are and how I can use them and the line that I tell them and this is a line that I believe which is like hey do you want to hang out like let's say I meet someone I'll follow up with them or I cold email someone and I'll say hey look the best case scenario here is that somehow we work together and we create Magic the worst case scenario is that you have a new friend in the industry and we'll just help one another but our world is small and I have a feeling that it's going to be nice that we're going to be uh on the same team in some capacity whether just as friends or literally at the same company so take this phone call and that's what I believe and so uh for years so like for example for years I would host events or create excuses to meet people so for example I had this thing called the anti- MBA it was my book club I started it in San Francisco in 2012 and basically the way it worked is I would pick one book per month we would read a quarter of the book each month and and then I we would meet up and talk about the book and I would bring experts on that book's topic to come in and lead the conversation so it's was kind of like an NBA but it was free and I organized it hence the anti- MBA a bunch of my great great great friends uh Sean and uh Pur we we came in each other's orbit via this book club um sea who um kazinski who's got a really successful PE firm now came he was one of my first members I posted ads on Craigslist for this book club that's how it got Popular by the way I posted an ad on meetup.com and on Craigslist and I would Host this book club like one I think I did it for two years straight every week and that is how I developed a network and then from there I hosted a conference called hustle con and the whole idea was I'm not sure what I'm going to do next after selling my previous company but I'm going to host this event called hustle con and in doing so I imagine I'm going to meet a handful of people who will inspire me or partner with me in order to create my next thing and so I'm constantly I I do it less now now I I jokingly have this rule called No New Friends because I have a pretty good Network now but basically I just collected people and anytime I saw someone who was intriguing I did a really good job of getting to know them and then just filing away in this bank or I would check in with them once in a while and get to know them uh and remind them who I was occasionally and then when I had like an opportunity like I'm starting a new company I would think oh I talked to this one person this one time I left a good impression on them I hope I can just holler at them and so I do a really good job of collecting people and doing Outreach um yeah I mean that's kind of like how it works it's a lot easier now that when you're popular and you have a podcast it's way easier to do that but when I was younger and did didn't have a network I hosted book clubs conferences meetups and I was basically wanting to be the center of attention not necessarily center of attention but center of a Social Circle uh and I was the connector and that's how I would collect people and I um when I see now when I see people on LinkedIn or Twitter and they write something cool I DM them and all I say was like saw this post this was awesome and that's all I'll say uh and then when I reach out to them again if I ever have a reason to it kind of feels like they know me a little bit at least and so I'm a collector of people okay this question is from Grant Wilkinson Grant F Wilkinson if you're open to sharing about the behind the scenes of running a great Community there's some good stuff there so I think Grant's referring to uh your community building over at Hampton so I've got this new company it's about a year old it's uh join hampton.com is the eurl it's called Hampton basically what it is is it's for CEOs who have at least a million in Revenue and you apply and then we interview you get in we put you in a group of eight Founders who have similar size and types of businesses you meet monthly and then we host all these um events Retreats and then we have uh digital Community where you can hang out and talk to all the other members of which we have hundreds of them soon thousands I I got pretty great at making Community because of the events that I hosted I kind of understood like what motivated people and then I created trends when we ran the hustle which was like a digital Community as well and there's a few interesting things about Community to make them great the first is you have to create fomo so a little bit of fear missing out and once they're in your community they feel excited that they're finally in and so we create fomo not even on purpose we interview everyone and we turn down most people so that helps um so there needs to be a barrier to entry for building a good Community I think there also has to be a way to create intimacy and so there's lots of tactical ways that you could do that where you have multiple communities within a community and like you can only Join one channel and not the other channels and the reason you do that is because I think that around like 250 500 people things get a little bit wonky in terms of not being able to know everyone and so you want to do you need to do a good job of making things intimate the way you do that is to keep it small another way that you do that is you set norms and standards behind int introductions and so at Hampton we do a really good job of saying look at Hampton we want you to brag about who you are because with most most of the times when you run a company it's not cool when you're talking to people that say like oh I run this company we do this much in Revenue this much in profit this many employees it's not that cool it's a little Tacky in this community we set lots of like strange Norms of which one of them is it's okay to brag and it's cool to brag because now I can learn if you actually know what you're talking about and I can ask you advice I can actually learn um about your business so I can apply some of it and so it's fun to learn that stuff and so we set different norms and we do a really good job of of making people introduce themselves a lot of times particularly in Trends my one of the first communities that I built I would seed it by having 10 20 30 people who I knew were impressive and I just said you don't have to pay anything but you're joining this community also on this date I need you to post this comment or this uh post and so it looked like this particular person was contributing in reality I wrote it for them this is a a thing that I stole from from Reddit when reddit.com first launched the founder Steve Huffman created like 30 different usernames and he just posted lots of different fake comments and it looked like a lot of stuff was happening creating Community is hard I think it's one of those things that everyone wants but few people know how to do it's really challenging I think it's more art than science though this question is I'm gonna totally butcher this name but Sarang birad song birod on Twitter he asks how's it going with viral cut share some tips for someone looking to start a productized service from scratch so viral Cuts is a company that I'm part of um I don't have anything to do with the day-to-day uh but basically if you want footage like if you have a podcast like this or if you have a bunch of video footage they chop it up and they uh post it on your social for you so you get like Clips um the founder his name's Hunter he used to have an agency and he he was was like you know it's cool agencies are great but when your agency is really Broad and you will do lots of services for lots of different uh clients and it's hard to focus on something it's hard to operationalize something your margins kind of get crushed a little bit and it's just a lot more challenging and so his whole thing was we're just going to do clips and then eventually now they're doing more stuff under a different company like they're doing um they're helping people write uh books or uh write Twitter threads I mean they're helping people do a bunch of different stuff um they're helping people grow their YouTube but those are all different companies but viral Cuts he was like I'm just going to productize this one service and so he did a really good job of hiring like 20 people and he taught them how to make the the the clips and then he like created a very strict process on how to get the footage from people how to chop it up how to deliver them and it was like very very very very operationalized from day one and it's going great I don't remember exactly uh what we're allowed to say about how big it is but it got to seven figures in Revenue in like 60 days most of which came because at first I tweeted it and that Cody Sanchez another partner involved she started sharing and so now it's like well into the seven figures um it's going great you have to deal with a lot of headaches because it's a people business but uh and we're not sure how churn will be but it's going really well so far the hardest part about these businesses is operationalizing the the service so making it so it's like a conveyor belt so your workers know exactly what to do and have very strict deadlines and then the second hardest part is getting customers viral cuts um solve that problem by talking to me and Cody and we just tweeted it out and within a very short amount of time they had seven figures in Revenue so it's going really well all right so that was my rapid fire Q&A this is what happens when Sean's not here we do a little rapid fire Q&A hopefully you guys enjoyed it if you are listening on iTunes Spotify whatever if you go to our YouTube You'll see some of the links to some of these examples and some of these topics that we talked about and if you like this let me know in the comments talk soon [Music]
