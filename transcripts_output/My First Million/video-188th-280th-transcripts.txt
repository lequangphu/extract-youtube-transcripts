all right Nick are you ready well I'm late because I had to go to Party City you are Party City dude you're the human Party City no but the funny thing is I went out there because I wanted to get some cool stuff for you guys for Sam I got a hot dog C thing CA Sam likes hot dogs and then for Sean you know I got the big basketball cuz Sean loves basketball and I got these balloons and as leaving this lady sees me with the balloons and the basketball and she's like oh are you planning a birthday for your son I was like first that's sexist and second no I'm going on a [Music] podcast all right so let me let me introduce Nick and I'll introduce him with a little bit of story I don't remember exactly how we came into contact with each other but basically I was in New York maybe eight years ago somehow Nick contacts me and he goes hey do you want to go to Washington Square Park and play Frisbee and I was like I I guess yeah okay so uh Sarah and I go and we meet him at Washington Square Park and he goes uh here let's just like walk I'll give you guys a tour so he gives us a tour he goes this is the guy that's always here selling weed hey weed guy how are you this is my friend Sam and Sarah and then he's like these are the people who are always tight roping hey tight RPP people like Nick is just a crazy person okay like we we've met him in a like you'll go out to dinner with him and he'll be like all right for the next five minutes I want to talk about my dating life and then from minutes 7 to 13 we're going to talk about your work and then from 13 to 27 where we want to talk about philosophy on life like he do you actually do this do you show up to like lunches like this with agendas 100% with agendas and sometimes even my own keynote presentations and let me hold on I had to give this quick summary so Nick's summary is basically he made money Nick started a business he sold it he made money he put all of his money in Tesla stock and got incredibly wealthy and now he is single in Austin and he just lives life to have fun and he does crazy stuff like he just recently did a blind date to Tokyo or he'll he just wrote a book on having a cocktail party because that's what he cares about and he just does everything to that fun is that right Nick yeah that is directionally correct I love to have fun and I didn't put all my money into Tesla and but yes I did make a lot of money a couple times in my life and now I get to have fun and I get to I think I'm like the end game that a lot of people are thinking about how to get to and they want to make a business and they want to be successful but for what and so there's a lot of talk about when is enough and I think I found enough and this is what happens when you get there how did you figure that out because that is something that not a lot of people have been able to figure out so how did you figure out what's enough for you and how did you actually execute that how did you figure out what you wanted what was enough and then do it you know one year I was doing my taxes and I had busted my butt in my business an absolutely incredible amount it was just one of the hardest years and I think maybe we netted out like $350,000 profit and and it was one of the hardest years of my life honestly for a variety of Staffing reasons and other things and as I was doing my taxes my accountant said like oh wow do you realize you made like so much more money from your Investments than you did from your business and I never thought about my investments I don't even think I just buy it set it and forget it and at that moment I was like wow I'm like destroying my health and my sanity for this amount of money that's not even as much as I'm making off the investment there were a few moments like that that I've had over the last 10 years that have just made me reconsider how I spend my time and you wrote a blog post because I went knee deep into the blog last night and you have this blog post you wrote a long time ago which was what would I do if I had $10 million I don't know when you wrote this but I found it in somewhere in the archive and you basically said you know I really want to have like $10 million and um you know kind of made me think like what would I actually do if I had it would I do today if I already had it and you and you put photos on there we should show this on on YouTube there's like index cards and you wrote like swim more right you wrote like write a book about hosting a cocktail party which you actually ended up doing and you wrote all these things and you it sounded like the takeaway was first of all we should do this exercise because like money is a tool to improve your life but if you don't really know how much you need and what you're trying to improve like it's sort of crazy like go into Home Depot for a house renovation project but you didn't know which part of your house you wanted to renovate or what what budget actually was and what materials you needed but that's how we treat our careers and then you got Clarity on it and you actually implemented can you talk about that that exercise you did because I did it last night too after you after reading that oh you did it so I hope to give actionable takeaways for your listeners listeners this is an actionable takeaway for you in that you can do this with your friends with your spouse with your loved ones to ask them if you had $10 million how would you live your life differently and get specific don't just say I want to eat better what does that exactly mean now sha may know this this is a Tony Robbins exercise that he's done either at business Mastery or upw and the gist I'll forward you to the end is that the vast majority of things we say that we would do differently at $10 million actually you only need a million dollars to get there the vast majority if you think oh if my life was was a billionaire this is what I would do you actually maybe only need 10 20 $50 million and I say actually that's still a lot of money but it helps you to realize that for example for a lot of people oh if I had a billion dollars of course I would have a private Chef so they say okay well let's track that out what does that exactly mean for you to have a private Chef you want to have meals that are set up in your fridge you want to have a fulltime person Etc and it was a very helpful exercise to me to think that in the past if I wanted $500 million well actually the vast majority of the things that I wanted I could do for much less without sacrificing all that time money energy to get to that level yeah there's but Sam have you heard this Morgan Hansel quote about money he says Uh there's two ways to use money the first is as a tool to improve the quality of your life and the second is as a measuring stick to measure the quality of your life and basically the people who are happy use as a tool and the people who are you know the bitter Rich uh the stressed Rich are the ones who are trying to use money as a measuring stick yeah the problem with that is like I on my list it's like influence politicians overthrow governments um you know like bribe officials and you need a lot more money than just $10 million for that for those of you that are listening by the way that are thinking that's not enough he has given up money is the measuring stick in the yard and the success of life I am totally with you and I lived that way for so much of my adult life there is money is just a measuring stick right we don't spend it we just keep it and that shows how good we are and so I still respect and sympathize with those people who like Sam want more money to influence politicians to buy private jets I'm joking joking okay but go ahead you're on the record as a lobbyist okay yeah say what would you even Lobby for yeah free Z for all I don't I me we have a proposal here for like larger serving size of bubblegum I guess sure it's all good yeah that's ridiculous uh but Nick but all right so you're like I you used to be a measuring stick guy for money but in the this blog post by the way you say at the very bottom you say um I would do all of these things which by the by the way like Sean didn't say but you have a list of like you want to go bowling you want to play laser tag you w to go go-karting that's literally on your blog post but at the end it says uh I would also uh like to work on entrepreneurial Pursuits to get to 50 million yeah yeah something like that uh I don't want to get into the gist of this I want to say that this is an activity that's helpful for listeners to do because it helped me realize that the things that truly make me happy playing tennis riding go-karts eating more healthy going to the beach those things don't have to cost $50 million and I keep a very low burn in my life right now so that it feels like I have a hundred million dollar Sean something that you probably don't know about Nick so he lived in New York City for a long time and he's been like a blogger a lot of people don't know this that Nick met Noah Kagan and Neville madora my good buddies in rem via blogging Nick was like one of these early bloggers what are you you're 40 let's say now Nick you started blogging when you were what like in your 20s gosh I had a website since 1996 yeah yeah and because of that he's actually met like a lot of these guys that are kind of like luminaries now so for example he's buddies with Matt Mullen Wag the founder of Wordpress or he grew up kind of grew up in New York with the founders of Vimeo and college humor and a bunch of these like interesting people that sort of shaped the internet that we know and and you were around them when you guys were all like up and coming and doing your own thing what was that like kind of like seeing some of these guys who were your peers become like these like people who are kind of controlling the internet or impacting the culture of the the internet well Sam I'm glad you mentioned that because this brings me into the second lesson and I'll be using this little lesson harmonica throughout today's podcast I love it hey real quick I want to talk to you guys if you are new to this podcast if you're new to business I have cool resource for you so the folks at HubSpot who sponsor this podcast have put together a kit a guide for people who are getting started on their entrepreneurship journey and it has a couple of Cool Tools I want to call out it's free tool by the way this whole thing is free you can just go download it and the first one is a freelance calculator so most people are really underpricing themselves if they are selling a service to a company they're freelancing which is a common way to get started at entrepreneurship is to be a solar preneur and this tool helps you figure out how much you should be charging your clients I know that most people who get started they're undercharging by you know sometimes as much as 50% so this is a great way to use this tool and get a better handle of how much should I be charging so if you're just getting started and you're a beginner in this journey of Entrepreneurship uh check out this kit the link is in the description below and thanks again to HubSpot for making this podcast possible the lesson is you know about 15 years ago when people were using Twitter a lot and there were a lot of startup Founders that I knew like Dennis Crowley of for square and Zack Klein of Vimeo and other people and I had absolutely no name on the public internet I was a blogger but I didn't have followers I was just known amongst a certain crowd somebody figured out that all of these famous people or famous and successful people in New York all followed me I think this was when there was a list of kind of like the public follows were more available and they were like dude why do all these people follow you and I was actually waiting to get a message like that I think there's actionable data that you can get to from finding and looking who else famous and successful people follow now follower lists are still available on Instagram so you can see the bulk of it I think on X they've throttled it back so you don't have the full follow lists available but if you are looking to make contact with some of these Ultra successful people there's no way that you will they have pretty much too much inbound but you can befriend their friends and that can be your foot in the door that is a lesson that is an aggressive networking example you have to lead with value you have to have something good you can't just do it to take but I think there is Sigma there is Alpha in looking to see who all of the major people follow because there's reason for that why do they follow you I think people followed me in New York City because I hosted events oh my God I hosted events that was my way to become interesting it was my way to be relevant and I just started hosting all these House parties so I want to tie up the kind of like the shift from killing yourself kind of working really really hard to make money to be successful which is where you know I've been Sam's been a lot of the listeners will have been so that's a relatable struggle to then the the next thing you do you did with life shift where you sort of prioritize experiences adventure fun which I think a lot of us want to do but are sort of afraid to do fully it's hard to get off that money money train so can we just do the speedrun of like what did you actually do in your career career how did you actually make it what did you try what did you actually do that worked yes speedrun of my career in middle school and high school I started to design websites I was not a popular kid I had friends but I wasn't in the popular crowd and I was really into computers and when I was in about n9th grade I made a web hosting company that just so happened to get lucky if you searched on Yahoo for the phrase cheap web hosting then you would find my website you can see that at vs3 net did did you do anything to be the discovered one or literally was it lucky dude it was just dumb luck we didn't even know about SEO then it wasn't like trying to optimize it just so happened that when I wrote my description that's how it worked out so you're in high school and that helped pay for college as I understand so what what did you kind of roughly make on that business not a lot of money maybe so the web hosting was $15 a month per client I it cost me $5 per month per client and at the most I probably had 200 customers it more average was throttled out to about 120 customers per month that helped pay for college but then I also got a scholarship for entrepreneurship which is very rare merit-based scholarship that allowed me to go to a nice college so web hosting business I did some other stuff I sell these like alpha numeric pagers that was never a huge success but I had all these little hustles when I got to wake by the way I started to sell speakers for laptops and I named the business wakes speakers.com and I'm going around door Todo I'm like oh you bought your kids this laptop they need speakers to listen to Shazam or whatever um and then the lawyers the school lawyers called me up like you can't call this wake speakers that's like the name of our school meanwhile I'm like Drop shipping pallets like onto the quad of the campus when I was in college I tried to start a software company that was massively popular on campus but made absolutely zero money I tried to move to India to start a software company and hire people because I thought that I could bootstrap it farther there it was a terrible success I hired two people one of them was in Boston beat the story is hilarious I've heard him say this before he's like I moved to India because I was like I'm gonna bootstrap this so I need cheap Talent so he moves to India to start a software company hires two people one guy's in Poland and one guy's in Boston and he's in India no employes in IND you got that equation wrong you you you answer yourself like if if it's like X Plus y you put yourself in the wrong variable I know I outsourced myself to the wrong thing I did though develop a really nice relationship with the people and the country and it was just a wild experience well let me ask one question there which is nobody cares about this but I do which is even though that was kind of a failure right you go to you move to India you hire a guy in Poland and Boston software company Nobody Knows the name of this it didn't work out but there's something if if somebody told me that somebody did that today I'd be like this person's going to be a winner this is probably going to be the failure but they were that person is going to be a winner what made you even want to do that in the first place because that's a pretty radical step most people I went to college with did not just graduate and like move to India with the idea of bootstrapping a software company it did seem like the craziest thing to do at the time and I think that's why I was attracted to it harmonica lesson you think I think so thank you so much so I do I use this harmonica at all my events as a crowd control device and I think if my legacy has anything it's that the harmonica can be a helpful crowd control device in that you can get people's attention in a calm cool manner without a whistle or like a right so consider that there's a tip within a tip why did I move to India yeah it just at the time it seemed like the future it did seem like a piece of the future there was all this news about Bo and Outsourcing and everything why pro moving over to India you you had said your college roommates were the were the guys who created college humor and Dio were you involved in that or you just kind of sitting by and they were doing it right next to you what what was that like I was very happy to not be involved in that and to be their friends and a soundboard I was the first non-employee user of Vimeo I Jake the guy who started Vimeo famously said that our thinking helped him think about vlogging and stuff like that um but they were absolutely an inspiration to me and it was so cool to be in that world of people really really great guys and then if you fast forward I think you're like the first time that you kind of you said you've made money like two or three times the first time was after that India trip with your you and your father right yeah he started a a business in the basement of our house I didn't end up seeing that money till much much later and still lived very frugally probably I still live very frugally actually but I guess I didn't really have money per se until maybe 10 or 15 years after that but yeah my dad started in the basement of our house this was my next big adventure I came home from India not sure what to do next my dad had been working on this business in our house that did inflight entertainment equipment for small Jets Sam on a plane with Nick it's just the two of us on his plane and Nick is like we get on and instead of just like sitting down putting his bag away relaxing he's like immediately fiddling with all the gadgets on the plane he's like trying to like pull off the in screen monitor like where the the map is of the plane I'm like theyum I'm like is there something behind that what are you trying to do here and he's like I just want to see which one they have like this is what and he's like did you know this and he's like giving me all these facts and five minutes later he finally tells me oh yeah this was the business that my dad and I worked on which was like they sold these little Parts electronic parts to planes in order to like you know hey you see how your trade table comes out and how there's this little thing here that's what we did and it was like a like I've talked to in his mom were it was the it was his mom and dad and then Nick and I've talked to them about it and it was like a smashing success you know it took a it took a while to like work but it was like a it was a it was a home run in terms of like they were working on it together it turned out to be financially fruitful and his parents are like the cutest parents you'll ever talk to and it was literally like a mom and pop shop it was like a you know where it's like Nick Gray and son like type of business like the name is that's what really what it was and it sounded awesome it was a very wholesome business were there any great stories from that that chapter where either unlock you guys figured out that made things work or a moment you thought he was you were screwed but then you figured something out is there any good stories from from that one thing I can tell you is that even in those early days search engine optimization played a huge role within the business and searching for FAA certified inflight monitors what a niche thing and yet all we needed was one and we really got a million dooll deal from the SEO because I bought every domain name I was creating fake blogs I had everything pointing back to our company that we dominated not just the first three results but like the first page of results because this was 2009 is when there was a lot less SEO stuff but even now it's such a niche industry one major lesson that I think I could say was that I was lucky to come up under this salt of the earth sales guy who ran our sales team and he was the type of guy you see in movies today he's got no social media he has nothing this was an Air Force guy who you know would pick up the phone at the at the at the shortest instance would cold call people there's a vivid memory that I have being at the trade show of somebody's badge being flipped around and they walked up and tried to talk to him and he just looks at them looks down at them grabs like like gets in their space grabs their badge turns it around and says oh Dan MCN normi you [ __ ] and and just like that that like good old boy type of attitude that I got to come up under and so there's so many people out there that are trying to solopreneur that are trying to bootstrap that are trying to hustle that just don't have any experience that have never learned those lessons that I'm so thankful that I got to learn through him and so that was one of those experiences his name was Jay Healey he was a huge influence on how I think about phone calls and sales and outbound and things like that oh wait wait a second I had a business idea so someone told me Jack Smith said this crowd loves business ideas and so I have a business idea for your listeners I have a couple business ideas but one of them is this you need to create a wh label Enterprise sales team quit trying to hire programmers whatever I want you going out there recruiting the guys selling Cutco knives I want you going to the mall finding the most Hustler guys selling that shoe soap stuff and I want you to start building them and training them on how to sell B2B sass if you are looking for an aqua hire salespeople are in high demand if you have guys that can sell and girls that can sell this company will get bought I don't care what you're selling but start collecting sales people and build a sales team you'll either get bought out you can build a SAS around it or you'll just get Aqua hired in this is a good business idea Nick what makes you special and Sean experienced it because you guys hung out and I don't think that he fully understood like that this is the type of stuff that Nick Ray does it's the weirdest quirkiest stuff but when he decides to be quirky and weird it's pretty authentic to him and he goes like a 10 out of 10 Sam is exactly right and it's the same idea of why I'm getting you know things like the hot dog hat for for Sam or the basketball thing for Shawn or like why do we just do little things to just make it interesting because I think that it's just different we can live life a little bit differently and I like to have fun yeah dude your crayon box has like four extra colors that I don't have that I need to I need to pick up I need to go find these colors um I when I when I was doing the research last night I made a note and I go I think that Nick has chugged the biggest glass of be yourself juice and now he's just belching the the the the remainder out for the rest of the world and you had this great quote you said uh you tweeted this out it didn't go viral but I loved it you said quit playing it cool life is too short be intense and passionate and mildly insane now whoever's left hanging is your friend yeah yeah the lesson that I would have for listeners is that I can live that way now I think because I grinded it out ground out I ground I gritted it out I think that I can live that way now because I achieved some success and I did some truly great things this is not your cart blanch permission to go an insane person that's not what I'm telling you and there's a fine line between genius and Insanity I'm not saying that I'm genius I'm probably more insane but I am 42 years old I have had some successful business I have been playing the game of business for way more than half my life and I feel that I have the confidence today to be who I want to be because I have achieved some of that success do you get lonely probably I don't exactly know what it would be not to be Lon L but I have a lot of friends you have a lot of friends and you have a lot of friends that are like I consider us to be very close where like I you're family to me but sometimes I think to myself I want a nin to5 just because people throughout the day can't hang out with me or I want like a routine just so I could have a family do you know what I mean but then other times I see you just jetting off to Japan on a blind dat and I'm like a that Adventure seems fun but it's hard to have both the stability of like a family sometimes and the The Eccentric like excitement that you get to have so do you ever get lonely leaning into one of those sides versus The Other Side the largest and most valid critique of me and my lifestyle would be that I am 42 and single and no kids and that people will say that that will be one of the greatest fallacies that I've waited so long to begin my life and my family and that no happiness can come from the the happiness of a parent loving their child and I think that that is 100% valid I also do not agree with the critiques that say just get married as soon as you can business will follow get married first Above All Else make that your priority I lived my life thus far through at least my late 30s making business success Financial Freedom my number one priority my number one in fact I hired a Matchmaker for a little while when I was in New York and she set me up with like 20 or 30 dates and at the end of it she was like Nick you know what I don't think you even want a girlfriend she said I think you just want to go on dates she said with your business right now you have no room in your life you would never make a woman your number one priority and I said that's exactly right yeah we should have talked about this beforehand there's like there's no chance like my business is my number refundable yeah yeah and I said like like this is my number one priority is my business I it's all that I think about it's all that I do I would wake up I had this girlfriend in New York who was a poet and we would wake up in the morning and she would want to you know color and and drink coffee and hang out I'm like babe I gotta grind like I don't I don't have time to call her there's no time to color we can't color today color me unimpressed with this plan yeah yeah no time it's like babe you got to go uh and I'm not here to hang out and that was a different time in my life when I was so focused on that so this leads me to my next business idea I am going to do potentially if enough people ask me for this the first seven figure millionaire Matchmaker that is only based on a contingency fee so I'm gonna have no cost I'm only going to take the top ofth top clients we're talking people like um I'm not going to name names but but folks that have a minimum probably 50 million net worth five million social followers I'm going to be matchmaking for these people and if they get married only success Gentleman's Agreement handshake million doll minimum success fee I think that that's interesting for a few reasons number one because think about all the cool people that I'm going to get to meet if I have this little roster of close friends and incredible people that I get to go up an approach and I'm like oh I'm matchmaking for such and such number two is most matchmakers will never work on a contingency basis they only work on a retainer but I don't need the money like I have plenty of time like I'm happy to let this play out over five years C can you explain how a traditional Matchmaker works I don't think most people know how much is it how much do a good Matchmaker New York cost and what do they give you I think there's a variety of different matchmakers and it's not just in New York City you can find these in Dallas Texas you can find them in San Francisco and Chicago matchmakers by the way gosh let's talk about this there's a huge range there's a huge range and actually PE companies do like to buy these businesses I've heard of two of them Brent B's company has bought one and someone else we both know looked at acquiring one of them but matchmaking services can go from $5,000 all the way up to $100,000 and the ones that I have heard of it's it's roughly a thou or sorry it's roughly $5,000 a date and they set you up and they extensively pre-screen these women yeah and in advance you get like a PDF like I've I've helped some of my buddies like review some of them you get like a PDF yes of like five different people and they it's crazy it says like lives in Jackson Hole but willing to relocate uh and then it like does a profile on them and you kind of pick and choose and how how much better is this PDF than just a if I went to somebody's Tinder profile and right click save as PDF what would I be getting that's different in this oh my god well the next piece of advice for listeners is you need to delete your dating apps you guys need to get off of the dating apps because you are not going to be able to make a difference nobody cares about you unless you're above 6 foot you're devilishly attractive the vast majority of men need to delete their dating apps please and I'll give you one tip you need to join a sports club specifically consider joining a kickball league now why kickball kickball has the largest number of teams so the team size is larger than any other Sport and generally both teams go out for drinks afterwards now you've heard other things like join a run Club go to yoga classes things like that if you do those things you basically can talk to two people at each one you can talk to somebody before four and you can talk to somebody afterwards but if you're trying to pingpong around this run Club to get numbers it's going to be very very low signal and you're not going to look good think about that start a match you got you gotta answer Sean's question and you have to run which sucks U okay Sean's question was how much more details do you get from a Matchmaker the one that I worked was a different way and so I would not get these detailed Advanced prep sheets for the $5,000 date ones they are checking to make sure that the things that are important to you are important to them as well and sometimes they do they do background checks on on everyone they do yes they do five grand a date I don't know if this is like the Indian DNA in me but it's like that sounds insane $5,000 a date sounds insane and obviously even if you're wealthy I get the rationality of why it would make sense but that sounds crazy especially when you have a low hit rate or low success rate with it but if you asked me today how much would you pay if I could introduce you to your perfect person that I'm a Believer in if you said and and I've actually told figures I'm like you should set up a bounty which is that if you introduce me to somebody that I I you know you fall in love with or get engaged or get married to like why would you not put up a million dollar $2 million do for that for them it would make such a huge difference in their life it's it's the best thing money could buy for those people and that is why I'm retitling myself to be Nick Gray babe Bounty Hunter and if you are listening to this and you are interested in putting up a seven figure bounty to find your person give me a call dude babe the Bounty Hunter such a good moniker you can have your own TV show with us Sam Nick is so funny because when we hung out he was the only person I've ever met in my life who calls people babes but not like not he call Turbo yeah he's just like I was hanging out with these two babes and I was start laughing like I've just never heard someone say that he's like yeah they were it was cool um okay so you're babe the Bounty Hunter million dollar contingency fee sell to private Equity I kind of love this idea you know I don't know if you're raising for this but I I'm interested we can get you some Distribution on the Pod we could do some special episodes once a month we talk about our our our our Suitor here I'm super stoked I'm excited I'll cut you guys in easy it's a yeah yeah it's a good deal look here's the thing it's very very hard for extremely successful people whether it's men or women to sell and to Market themselves appropriately and I don't necessarily believe that having money is a bad thing I think it is something to be proud of but there's no good way to say that about yourself anyhow do you know a lot of single wealthy men Sean yeah I know so many of them I call them Peter Pans uh like I've got I've got yeah sorry Nick you're Peter Pan um and what's crazy to me is Nick's not one of these guys typically I would have thought you'd be good at some type of public speaking whether even if you just have a team of 10 people like you could talk to them in in front of them there's a lot of attributes that you would think would translate to women not the case not the case with a lot of friends and I and that has always boggled my mind you know what I mean do you have friends like that Sean and doesn't that seem kind of crazy yeah I mean the crazier part honestly is that you know you'll talk to them and it's basically like yeah this is the one thing I really want that's the area of my life that I want to you know invest in I want to to to grow to bloom that's the part of my garden I want to bloom and then then you talk to them they say that to you but in the next four weeks they're like I'm on the road I'm doing sales calls I'm going to this pitch it's like dude you took you took 49 pitches in the last two months but you know one date and it's like the priorities don't match the calendar but I get it it's because there's a human tendency which is that whatever is not going well for you wherever area you're struggling in it's easy to just avoid that and gravitate towards the things that are giving you that immediate dopamine hit of success of progress of being great at something and I wish that they wouldn't do that you know the the ones I respect the most are the ones who like fight against that grain and they're like dude the incremental dollar does nothing for me at this point but meeting you know my life partner would be an amazing thing for my life and really put Match their calendar with their priorities dude I have listen to this Nick I hung out with my friend yes uh last week he's worth probably $200 million sold sold the company fabulously wealthy he's 6'4 he's polite nice he's awesome he's just an awesome guy and I met with him and my wife and I met like we hung out with him and he was like Hey I met this girl on hinge and we matched I don't know what to say to her can you guys like can I like run some idea I'm like are you kidding me you're nervous to have this text based conversation I'm like dude you're the catch here like you're like the you're like perfect what are you talking about and he was nervous and we had to like go through each line he's like does that sound weird does it sound weird if I say this and I think there's a shockingly large amount of men that are like that which is which is insane to me the dating thing is interesting I Sean I put my hands up when you were doing this because I was like yes the calendar doesn't lie if this is important to you but you know what I'll say something that folks are saying online if you're listening to this podcast because you want to be financially successful I think you need to have priorities in life and it is very hard to run and be laser focused on your business when you're trying to build a relationship dare I say it's almost impossible just a bunch of dudes playing with harmonicas with balloons talking about how to get chicks yeah oh what are you doing over there Johnny I'm listening to this guy in the harmonica talk about how to find your life partner oh he must be very successful is he married no he's single what was what was your other idea idea okay I got another business idea I think we should bring back web hosting companies specific specifically Services agencies to help local small businesses build very basic WordPress websites we poo poo these simple ideas notice what the focus is the focus there is sales can you sell it to them but you go to somebody and you say look for 50 bucks a month I'm going to host your site I'll make sure it doesn't get hacked I'll keep it lightly updated you know you can buy an additional thing if you want to make updates but this is a SAS business you are now creating websites where you are selling them this hacker web hosting whatever you're just doing the basic stuff I think we think that we have to come up with this new AI stuff go back to the basics like start making web pages for restaurants in town and start at the basics I think we need to bring back web hosting companies I got a cool Twist on this which is uh the why now or what what you could do differently now I have a friend who's doing this right now they took I won't give away the category because I don't want them to feel like I invited competition for them but they they found a specific category so a specific type of business it's not pest control but let's just pretend it was pest control for a second so they picked a category and then they were like cool if I hired like a fancy New York design agency to make an awesome website for this company doesn't have to look super super slick but like much slicker than what they have by default and checks all the boxes of what a company like that needs oh they need to immediately be able to request a quote they need to be able to do XYZ cool got the requirements got five design templates made and then with what they did was they were like cool you know AI is actually amazing at this so they told the AI they were like ai go find every let's just use pest control as an example every Pest Control business in New York right now that you can find on on the online easy to do it crawls it gives you a spreadsheet of all the the names of the companies and their URLs says great then it created another AI agent that said take their existing website pull out the info and then apply it to one of these five templates and it did that and then it said and then he said another AI agent was draft a cold email to this list of prospects and include a mockup an attachment that was made by agent 2 that that redid their website and so they're getting this crazy response rate because they're going to these business and they're saying hey I was checking out your site just so you know I'm a web developer I help companies like you I actually made a mockup of your I made a mockup of your your website like of what I think I could do with it if you think this looks cool I'd be happy to do it for you for this monthly fee and they're doing lead gen they're getting amazing lead gen because they're coming with a hyper personalized offer which is not just hey do you need a website or hey I make websites for companies like you but hey I looked at your site I thought I could you know improve it here's what it looks like improved do you want it and that is is just that makeover can now be automated with AI which again I don't think you need to make your idea successful but it does add a turbo juice that like didn't exist before that now can work what do you use for that that I mean that that's that outbound seems amazing for everything it is amazing it's the the AI sort of go to market idea which I think right now the people who are going to make the most money in AI are the people who the AI tool providers but then ALS but then the second one is going to be people who can string together AI tools to like turbocharge sales I want to use them do you know what they are yeah I mean it's three different things right so there's like let's say for the automated emails there's a c tool called clay that's really good at that clay sends personalized emails it basically takes gives you a prospect list it'll enrich the prospect list so it'll cool give me all the companies who fit this criteria it'll give it to you then it'll say add in how many employees they have roughly their revenue range who is their CEO and what's their phone number and it'll it'll fill that whole table out for you automatically and then you could say cool draft some email scripts for me to email these people and it'll basically create templates that then can be sent hyper personalized templates but before that let's say you need the other piece well you might use claw or something like that where you're going to say build a tool build a little tool for me where I can basically input this and I can get out a website in this format so you maybe use claw with artifacts to do that or some custom work around that and then the first piece which was just the prospecting that's pretty easy there's a lot of tools that can do the just just the prospecting side for you that's crazy that is crazy God damn help me think about this guys is there something here that I want to RI on which is that Sean just had this great idea notice that my idea was go to local restaurants and try to sell them a new website Sean took it to the nth degree no write a script so now you can do 5,000 a day and blah blah blah and I want to pull listeners back to my side of the aisle yes I think I think I midwit MD it for you which is to say like there is Beauty in the Simplicity of getting started and and calling and hand coding building your business and that has shown up for me when I did my Museum tour business I was a tour guide you guys I built a multi-million dollar business out of being a tour guide every Friday and Saturday night I was literally leading people at the Museum and I did that for two years before I even hired my first person how much money are you making just you doing that during the tour guide each ticket was like $80 I would tour for 10 to 20 people a night and doing it every Friday Saturday night so you can do that math dude Sean my uh so Nick had this compy called Museum hack where like was it was it Moma or where what museum the Metropolitan Museum of Art the best museum in the whole world that's where we started he just hijacked it so like he didn't ask them permission if he could give tours there yeah you called it Renegade Museum of Tours right so not part of their their offering and so he built that business sold it whatever Sarah my wife and and Nick are are close friends and she was like hey Nick can you give my mom and I like a private tour of of Moma or the Met something like that and he's like yeah I got you so apparently my mother-in-law was like you know I like Nick but I kind of felt dangerous being around him because like the security guard would be like hey you can't go through that elevator and Nick would be like oh no no trust me it's okay and he would just like walk on the elevator like like he would tell them like no you're wrong it's okay trust me and would just go and do whatever he wanted to do and that's is that how you ran your business yeah I like to think that some of those guarded off areas are more suggestions rather than rules and that as long as you're being fence yeah exactly exactly whoa can't go under it watch me um no no no um I have a lot of respect for these museums and for the art but we would do different non-traditional things we would lay down on the floor to look at the ceiling we would sit down to talk about the art we would talk about how much the paintings cost which is a very taboo thing in the art world and we would do all these non-traditional things in a museum space to really do Museum tours for people who didn't like museums and I want to just say that again I did tours myself as a side hustle while I was still in the family business this was my thing to build up enough money so I could quit the family job and start my own every Friday Saturday night like like that is why why I had no dating life because I was running this business which brings me to my next business idea Airbnb experiences if you are interested in starting a new side hustle you can sign up on Airbnb experiences to lead a tour in your town and charge people for it this is a way for you to immediately start to get money from people searching for cool things to do now this only works in major towns where they've launched Airbnb experiences but it's generally tier one and tier your two cities find your favorite stuff do tours for locals show them around to some of your great stuff provide a great experience beg for five-star reviews and you can literally create a side hustle on Airbnb experiences dude I love Airbnb experiences I've done probably 15 of them I freaking love them you ever do those Sean I've never done one but I've looked at it a bunch I like Nick framing of this which is like I've been thinking about this a lot like starter businesses because I wrote I wrote this blog post post uh this essay last week that was about my kind of like first two years out of college this like really I called it being strategically broke I like just avoided getting a job I said I'm not going to get a job I want to have Max freedom and so I calculated instead of how do I make the most money how do I make like what is the minimum money I need to have Max freedom and that shift what everybody else that I graduated with was just like how do I get the best job get make the most money which you don't even make that much money anyways it's an entry-level job they all suck and so I think skipping that level of the game altogether was a great choice but at the time it looked really bad like my apartment looked like [ __ ] I lived super Scrappy we slept on air mattresses like all of that stuff you know we couldn't afford a dog so we got a mouse like you know we did a bunch of like random things like that but then we did little things that were starter businesses like I had a little Tutoring company and then I started doing like a Basketball Camp once a you know during the summer and then we did this like thing where we sold wristbands to like sororities and fraternities who needed like just like a themed thing like they wanted their name written on some [ __ ] and that taught me how to make a website and go to Alibaba and like none of these were like businesses that were super lucrative or most made no money some made a little bit of money nothing you'd be impressed by but they were amazing starter businesses that get you your first dollar which is like a very addictive feeling and it it's it gets you out of theory and into reality and it gets you moving and it teaches you a bunch of the core tools and skills that you need like sales and marketing that you're going to have to figure out when you're ready for a bigger business and Airbnb experiences I love this idea because it doesn't even sound like a business it's that much of a starter business anybody could do this this is literally now just a question of like are you willing to actually do something or are you just going to talk about it for the rest of your life and anybody could sign up to do one of these like can you walk in your the area where you already live and can you point your finger at things if you can do if you could do that you could host an airb me experience and I think it removes all excuses and it gets the ball rolling for people I love these starter businesses love what Sean said that it takes you out of Theory and into practice my first million listeners some of y'all have never run a lemonade stand and it shows okay and so we're going to give you some ideas world star got him here's the next one it's a similar one because you may not like doing tours like I'm not a tour guide Geek Squad type neighborhood computer service I'll give you one that is a genius I was hanging out with a friend yesterday her laptop was disgusting the screen is all smudged up there's cookie crumbs in the keyboard there's all this stuff and I've had this fantasy of doing of dressing up and just going door too to help fix people's stuff I'm talking boosting their Wi-Fi cleaning their computer helping them with some basic tech support stuff measuring the power another pet peeve of mine is a lot of people have really bad cell phone chargers and cables they're not charging with USBC with the full max power new business idea it's Geek Squad as a service where you go door too maybe even just to clean up their laptops and phones I found this Gunk online that's this like gel sludge that you put into keyboards to suck up all the dust and the dirt you can walk around with a little toolkit and for $100 make some massive improvements for people all you need for that is about $100 worth of supplies you need a little bit of knowledge on the tech side and need to dress up nice and look respectable but thinking about these things that don't necessarily scale do those things start there you need to get your hands dirty in these type of environments that's my suggestion did you see Sean when Nick travels did you like did he show you all the gadgets he keeps in his bags yeah he well I didn't see too he he had a pillow he had like an apple Vision Pro uh I don't know what he had like you know some juggling balls he he had you know the essentials dude he he's so funny when he travels like he researches stuff like crazy like he'll have like the best charger uh but he also is um he knows how he wants to live and he lives that way so for example apparently I don't even know what buckwheat is but there's a buckwheat pillow that he loves and whenever he goes to a hotel he buys that $50 or $100 pillow and he has it shipped to to the hotel room because he's like I have to have this buckwheat pillow Nick what's up with the pillow think how Wild this is that we will spend three four sometimes $500 a night for a hotel even2 $1 a night and yet your sleep can be ruined by some of the smallest things the pillow was the one variable that as I traveled the world I realized that I could control and someone once said to me strange pillows equals strange dreams and I realized that I might might not be able to control the mattress but I can at least control the pillow and so I learned about these Japanese buckwheat pillows when I was over in Tokyo you kind of even love them or you absolutely hate them the largest hard as a brick have you ever had one of these I think I might have done it wrong it's mine is so hard yeah you need to remove half of the holes okay so if that's a complaint that you have that it's too hard then just dump out half of the holes and the good news is it's buckweed you can have it for dinner I guess what I appreciate about you is so like I think Sean's the same way as me where I will see something or something disappoints me and I'm like [ __ ] it I'll live with it you know to be like oh uh you brought me pesto Pizza I ordered a steak Yeah [ __ ] it whatever like I just I don't even like pesto but like I'm just going to deal with it whatever or my haircuts bad and I don't want to complain it'll grow back [ __ ] it uh you are not that person yeah when when the barber asks you do you want it rounded or squared you have an opinion whereas whatever fine you don't have to do it just I like game now you want the money like [ __ ] me right uh you have opinion about stuff and I appreciate that thank you thanks I and you like put in the effort to like have life your way I I don't really do that as much isn't there some story about like a billionaire who does the same thing nick uh but not with a pillow but with does that with a mattress right yeah what's the story I don't want to comment on it I have heard that somebody does has positioned a couple dozen mattresses around the world in major metropolitan areas and so that when he goes to the hotel his Advanced team moves the mattress into the hotel room so he has the same exact sleep anywhere just to remove any number of variables possible uh Sam what does your Advanced team do I don't know how to reply to that my Advanced team I'm your Advanced team I love being Sam's Advanced team at events I love to get him the name for that you you Nick is my body guy so sometimes I like for example sometimes I'll get invited to speak someplace and I'll be like I'm only going to go like for example we had one and I was like I'm only going to go if Neville and Nick will go with me because I don't want to go alone and I'm like Nick do you want to come with me he's like yeah can I be your body guy and I was like I just want you to come as my friend he's like well but can I be your body guy I'm like I don't know what a body guy is but yeah I guess like as long as yeah sure as long as like it's nothing that would make my wife angry usually into that but I guess and so he's my body guy and he like he goes all right Sam so uh what that means is like uh so on Wednesday your schedule is this this and this we're going to go here here here and here and like I go to this talk and there's like 10 people in the crowd like no one came and he's like all right um we're going to do autographs and photographs over here so Nick uh Sam come with me and like I'm like dude Nick like this like you're no no one wants to do any of this stuff he's like no no no we're gonna do this and then and then he'll be like uh he'll see someone walking by and he'll grab them and be like hey so is it true that you want to take a picture with Sam and he's like and and he's like I'm like is that what a body guy means a body guy is like the opposite of a bodyguard bodyguard keeps people away a body guy brings people to you that's great I love it he like created this hype he's like a hype man and it was so funny I had the funniest embarrassing interaction the other day so I was when I went to that trip in San Diego I was wearing this hat this hat um right here and so I was standing waiting for like my tacos at the Taco Shack and this guy goes hey I don't want to bother you but like do you mind if I take a picture and I was like H sure man that's cool you know uh you've been listening for a while he's like no no I just like I like your hat my friend has a company called West and I just wanted him to to see this and I was like I was like oh um yeah I I just assumed that you want me all you know what are you getting tacos do you want my tacos I had no way out of that that moment um by the way Nick cuther harmonica I got a riff on your idea your Geek Squad thing I think it's a simpler version of it which is every uh parent I know that's like kind of like my parents age has this box in their house of just old home videos and so I think a even easier one versus like can I help you with your stuff is just to say hey do you guys have any like home videos from your kids uh because I can convert them into stuff that you can have you know on your computer on the internet so you'll never lose them they'll live forever can't even find a VHS player anymore so I can take if you just have that box I'll just take the box and I'll do it for you and then you basically drive it to like you know CVS or Costco and they do the [ __ ] for you but like there's a gap there where most people don't they're not really aware of the problem or it's on their to-do list they'll never do it but if a kid showed up at their door dress nice million dollar smile and said I'd love to take care of that for you I'm doing that for people in the neighborhood I could take it from you right now just show me the closet where it is and I'll go grab it I think that you can make you know an easy few thousand do um you know in a couple months of effort effort there which sounds like not that much but you know at different phrases of your life a few thousand dollars is all the money it's all you need right and and it gets you going knock knock ma'am can I ask you a question how much are your memories worth boom boom keep your memories safe yeah it's an easy it's an easy cell you use the Wolf of Wall Street fair enough close like you watch all the YouTube videos about sales and you over you're complete Overkill going door too it's like Sam have you seen that that company that's doing these nap these nap bands me and Nick we're talking about this on the plane there's like if you haven't seen this on Twitter SE it's thisp band they have this like device that's like you gotta find it's called element or something like that it's uh to put you to S to send me my freeit shipping I I've been begging these guys to try it because I'm a I'm a prolific Napper and napping is like part of my brand and uh I really how do you spell it e l e m i and and Sean and I can act out the skit that we're going to do as a promo video for you if you want I'm Deepu Chopra or a billionaire this is what they're doing right now it's a pre-released product but they're building insane hype on Twitter because they'll go to a famous person so Nick I'm the billionaire and you're the founder of el mind okay deepo I'm gonna give you the new um El mind why don't you put this on and see if it'll set you to sleep just like this okay that's it m what's up everybody I'm Susie CEO of alamine this is deepo Chopra look at that little [ __ ] fell asleep in 5 minutes he's out like a light [ __ ] you can't even hear me what's up deep little [ __ ] free orders open now this isal strategy right now they take a famous person and they just knock them out so fast but almost to the point where they're just drooling and it's like yo and she literally puts a picture of them sleeping it's like my worst nightmare it's like punked it's like a mix of eight sleep and Ashton ccher coming out the van it's amazing it's the best Market C I've seen in a while she does have that attitude she's like deepok troa got him the leader of the Free World right now but watch this boom out like a light [ __ ] yeah oh sleeping like a little baby little CEO needs nap [Laughter] time is this legit at all I think I think it is legit I think it I would pay for this thing I want it I want it yeah this is this is insane there's no way this works right no I think it works yeah I'm a Believer well speaking of unique marketing strategies can I talk about what I did on Google reviews with my Google Maps photos well and by the way the Equinox lady came up on this element eleine thing I want to hear the Equinox story tell the Equinox story first cuz I hadn't heard that uh before until you texted me last night but I have only heard you texted me so I don't I don't know the story great so first of all the moral of the story I'm just going to cut to it is that listeners next experiment that you need to be doing bring back blogging you need to fill the AIS and the AIS need to have data from the public web to scrape I've been saying this for a long time blogging needs to make a comeback take some of your best Tweets put them into your blogs if you need to you don't have to create new content but just put the stuff you're sharing elsewhere into blogs a great example of that is my own monthly Recaps if you go to nickr news.com you go to the blog you click the monthly Recaps I take some of my best posts and I put it there on the blog on the public internet in order to scrape and you need to do this for a few reasons but one of the reasons is for nefarious purposes I wanted to find a list of all of the Equinox gyms in New York City that had swimming pools very hard list to find and so I made my own list of all the equ o gyms with swimming pools it started to rank pretty quickly as the number one search result for other people searching for the same thing unfortunately my gym started to get very crowded and I would have to wait for the lanes to swim at my gym and I'm getting 50 100 visitors a day to this page and so I uh closed my gym swimming pool according to my blog for maintenance for a year so that I would have to wait for less people and people would say hey they'd go there they'd say hey guys sorry this pool's closed for a year you know we're resurfacing the bottom pavement but these are some other nearby pools and yeah so that's jail listen Sean Google like nickr Equinox he has a PDF on his website download download my full list of Equinox uh gyms with pools and you could and and if you sign up we'll send you uh the pool links for each of the New York City quinox pools you know I got that lead magnet for the friends newsletter brother I'm here lead magnet yeah you're going to be you're going to have just dozens of pool fans in New York who worship you wait literally that's my life a dozen here a dozen there all right so you SEO hacked your way into having your own Pool Time for free because you told everybody the pool's closed that's on them for not having better SEO cool yes yes I have a couple other stories like that what okay yeah give us give us a couple other I like these uh cool so you know gray area oh dude the the gray area Perfect theme with your last name all right keep going the gray area I like it all right here's another reason that you should be blogging and writing about interesting things I noticed that that movie about Herbal Life the bill Amman movie was produced by this hedge fund guy named John fichthorn and I couldn't really find a lot about him and he wasn't ranking for a lot because some of these guys story is basically that Jon must have been Pro Herbal Life and Amman was anti- Herbal Life and so they were having like a PR fight John was anti as well and was funding this movie to show Bill's sort of anti-tory some some reason or another John got involved I don't remember the gist of it but he was a hedge fun guy who was a producer of this movie and there wasn't a lot about him so I wrote an article about all the stuff I could find about him various news articles whatever I scraped it I put it all into a thing and literally like six months ago he called me up he's like hey is this Nick Gray I was like yeah he's like uh this is John fitone you wrote an article about me I was like oh my God I'm so sorry like do you want me to remove it he's like no I just want to fix some things can you change some of these things that you got wrong and we ended up having like a 30 minute phone call he told me about his new strategies and ideas and all the things he's doing super cool connection that he doesn't know me from anybody but because I rank for him he reached out and he wanted to help out that's that's one reason I've done this in other times if there's this art thing called the Normandy panels okay the SS Normandy was a French cruise ship that traveled the world in the 1930s basically to Proclaim to the world that France is awesome and it had some of the most amazing art deco Interiors I became captivated with the story of the ship um World War II broke out the ship was changed into a military craft and all the guts were ripped out and now show up in private collections around the world I love this stuff nobody was really tracking these panels and so now I am the def facto resource for these panels on the internet just as a hobby project that I've maintained on my blog last week I literally got a call from a conservation expert at the Metropolitan Museum of Art asking me for advice about who they can talk to as they're thinking about these panels and how they're going to show and display them all of this is through publishing and living your life online these are little moments of when I've done that that have paid off for me in the long game it's important to know this didn't happen overnight this is a long-term investment Nick there was a guy who I did a podcast with a couple days ago Sam couldn't make it and it's it's a guy named gu Spear and he's a he's a kind of well-known value investor he's a disciple of Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger he ended up meeting Warren Buffett and all this stuff and one of the things that came out of it that I didn't realize is he he read the the book persuasion uh by Robert Chini or whatever I forgot what the exact title is I think it's pers influence influence sorry and I guess the context is he had a fund and he was investing kind of friends and family money he's like dude I'll never get Beyond friends and family money if like I don't learn how to do sales and marketing I have no idea how to do that but like let me go try to read a couple books so he reads this book and he reads about the guy who was the number one car salesman in the world he says this guy broke the Guinness Book of World Record sold the most cars more than anybody else and they went and they studied him and they said what what are you doing differently what is your influence what is your persuasion technique and he used to send out thousands of handwritten notes to anybody he would meet he would send a letter and the letter was very simple he would write their name and he would write I like you and um and he's like you know people like to be liked that's it it just said dear Sean I like you from I don't know the exact that's what the book says I don't know if there was more to it now he reads this and he's like he's like I don't know much he's like I'm not great at many things he's like but when I do hear something that like might help me he's like I'm desperate enough where I just throw my all into it the one good thing about me is I don't have go in so he's like I decided all right I'm not leaving work any day until I've written at least three notes he's like first one he wrote was like you know Sam I like you he's like oh my God I can't send this this just feels so weird so he's like okay I'll change that to thank you he's like I can always say thank you he's like thank you for blah blah blah he's like I could always find something to thank them for and U so he started writing three thank you notes a day and he started writing that and he started upping the volume and then he tell tells a story about how that led to ultimately him actually meeting Warren Buffett he's like you know it's not that everything you know turned into some transactional thing is it but I didn't even want that he's like it's not even that I actually genuinely felt it in the moment he's like I forced myself to do it but then I started to kind of feel it like as I went because I'd have to think what am I thankful for and if you keep asking yourself what am I thankful for in this person you'll start to actually appreciate them more it started to work and what H happened was he went to the annual meeting of this guy Mish PAB and monish was a famous investor he's been on the Pod he wrote him a letter afterwards that just said Thank you for having me at the event um and by the way he didn't invite him he just said Thank you for having me at the event I had a great time and that was it and monish called him the next day and he goes um hey I don't know he's like I'm monish he's like oh wow how'd you get my number he's like he's like well I looked you up because you you know I've been having these meetings for for years and you're the only guy who's ever wrote me a thank you note afterwards and so I just I just had to get to know you would you like to get lunch tomorrow so they get lunch and at the lunch says you know this lunch is great Warren Buffett has a charity lunch and I think we should bid on it uh would you come in with me like you know whatever amount you're comfortable with I'll cover the rest I'll cover you know four fifths of it three fours of it you cover whatever your share is but I want to go to it with you oh so guy spear was up more upand coming with than Manish yes exactly Manish had like a he had like a at the time like a $80 million net worth guy was much smaller than a single digit millions and um so guy was like I I think I could put in like 150k 200k 250k okay Max please and uh and so they they bid on it they won and then they end up eating Warren Buffett now the story comes full cirker while we're doing the podcast he could reaches back and he goes is this on video and he pulls out a letter that Warren Buffett sent him just saying guy thanks for coming to the event you know um you know blah blah blah and he's like Warren he's like with his assistant sends out these holiday cards every year to thousands thousands of people and he's like he's like Warren Gets this principle of basically everything you publish out there whether it's a directed thank you note or Nick in your case these blog posts that you publishing to the world is a invitation for Serendipity you don't really know what's going to come out of it but if you do enough of it in the long term like you will far out kick your coverage you will get a huge return on this investment um plus it just feels good to everybody involved doing it you'll feel good doing it they feel good that's such a good story that's a great story the surface area of serendipity and they talk about that in a lot of different things right that's why we we you don't get lucky you put yourself in the opportunity to become lucky right you uh you want to hear another fun fact about Nick I he's the only person who has host parties and literally five of his ex-girlfriends will be there at the same time and they all love each other and they get along perfectly I want to host a girlfriend conference I want to host a conference for all my ex-girlfriends because I really do think that they would get along and they're such incredible amazing people it might be the worst idea ever but but I do I think you should 100% do that just I think there's no doubt this idea I see no potential issues yeah think I think this is this is going to go wonderfully I I think that's I think that's perfect I think you've nailed it home run Nick can you talk can you give us the five minute crash course on how to throw a party um you know what is the I haven't read your book yet I'm sorry I bought it but I haven't read it yet what many how many copies have you sold by the way 20,000 maybe 21,000 it's pretty good that's great pretty good right each one here's the thing about a party book by the way nobody wakes up and says you know what I need today is a book about how to host a party they want books about how to get rich they want books how to lose money how to blah blah blah nobody says they want a party book and so that's been an uphill battle so I'm very very proud of that self-published sales figure and but I I understand you have something called the Nick method I don't know what the Nick method is what is the Nick method for hosting a party so the Nick method to host a party will absolutely level up I'm going to do harmonic on this because if you do this one thing you will level up your events to be so much better and the reason is that the bar is so low for a successful event think when somebody invites you to like a company happy hour you're just people standing around at an open bar it's like bad that's that's the old way and the future can change if we Bend our will to make it do that you can do that with the Nick method when you host events n c k like my name the n stands for name tags fill out the name tags first name only big block letters the name tags I like are the qualek 300s I also like the Avery 54 24s the qual 300s come in six different colors and you guys may know those they discontinu the 54 26s which was really sad actually it's the Vintage you should you should completely make up the model numbers by the way and just see if anyone ever finds out and be like I've been waiting I have an envelope for the it's a golden ticket it's like for the first person that realized that I was completely making up the model numbers of these name tags you are my fellow nerd I may have got those model numbers wrong why do the name tags matter because I went to a party with of yours and at first I was like okay this is second grade this is cheesy but then it was kind of useful obviously because I don't remember a lot of people's names but it seems like there's more to it than that what is the like what's the why behind the why the why behind the why is it's like a sports Jersey to show everybody that we're on the same team have you ever walked into an event it's the first time you've gone to something and you figure that it's me walking into something else everybody else must know each other they must all be friends already I Am The Outsider when you have name tags you show that you are all on the same team this is not a party of clicks we're all here together by the way if you host meetups you absolutely have to do name tags when you host at a bar or another public spot so you know who is there for the Meetup have you ever gone to a Meetup and it's at like a beer garden and you're like well who's here for the Meetup like oh these people it's like great I guess I'll just figure it out on my own Amateur hour all right and name tags I'm in I buy yeah and his name tags I stands for intros or ice breakers when I wrote the book I called them icebreakers but there's such a cringe reaction to the idea of icebreakers on that word so now I call them intros and this can be in small groups it can be your whole group together but what's the first thing that everybody asks when they meet you what's your name what do you do for work we're going to get that out of the way by having everybody say it real quick I think it is important by the way to say what people do especially for listeners of this pod because you never know who's looking for a job who wants to network who's working on growing their business but those rounds of intros give you an excuse It's a conversational crutch for your guests to go up and start new conversations your role as the host great way to do that like is there a better and worse way to do those intros or icebreakers my man of course dude I've done more ice I I live and breathe icebreakers you have come to the right spot uh welcome to Nick Gray's party Icebreaker therapy because I've spent a lot of my life doing ice breakers um here's the deal there's do you know uh do you know Stefan from SNL's Weekend Update like you are Stefan right now that is you that is you I'm so passionate about ice Burgers because I've seen so many bad ones you know an example of a bad one is all right everybody team meeting let's go around and say one fun fact about yourself that's a terrible Icebreaker so much of my work involves making people that have social anxiety or consider themselves introverts to feel more welcome and I know that some of them are going to hate this idea of intros but ideally what they like is to be able to know what to expect and minimal surprises and so a green level Icebreaker or intro at the beginning of an event when there's no social Rapport when people new and a little uncomfortable is just an easy one that doesn't take time the exact question that I have most people do is hey everybody real quick let's just do a round of intros you got to say the why the why is that there's a lot of interesting people here and I really want you to go meet somebody new so we're going to have you say your name say what you do for work or how you spend your day and then tell me one of your favorite things one of your go-to things that you like to eat for breakfast now that's a bit of a red Hain because I actually don't want to know their breakfast I want to know what they do for work but we take away the attention we make them think about the breakfast the breakfast one works because it's easy it's subjective people don't judge you for it and it's not hard you don't get locked up in your head a bad example would be hey everybody let's go around name what do you do for work and tell me your favorite Business book favorite is definitive it is your absolute favorite people are going to judge me oh my God favorite what's my favorite what's my favorite so we start with a very easy one so you could do the breakfast if you want to make it a little edgier you could ask people and say your favorite Vice or say what was one of your first online screen names and why did you choose it or what was one of your first jobs that you ever got paid cash money for now those are beginner level ones I want to tell you an advanced one but I want to check with you guys can I keep going yes yes keep going as you continue the event about an hour later you want to do one more advanced round of intros and this is what I call a value additive intro value additive means that everybody's answer adds to the benefit of the room and so for Sam for example who lives in Connecticut now say that he was hosting this in Westchester you would say hey everybody we're going to do our last round of ice breakers your question is going to be what is one of your Westchester Pro tips or life hacks or little secrets what's a small business you support a dog park you like a hiking trail you enjoy what's the best coffee shop in town tell us one great thing in town that you like and want to shine a light on okay so that's one example one more example if you don't want to focus on your town would be hey everybody we're going to do a last round of intros and I want you to share a great piece of media that you have consumed recently what's a movie you watched a documentary a podcast like my first million like And subscribe Gentleman's Agreement uh what are some of those things that you liked and you want to share okay and then you go around the room and you do that why does this work it works because every answer gives somebody value oh I've been meaning to go to that restaurant oh my first million I love those guys oh I I heard about that book I want to check it out and you do it towards the end of your event so at the end people get all these new ideas they've met all these new people and they leave with a feeling of value they leave feeling that they're better than when they showed up that's what a good party is you did something at a party I went to of yours where I don't know you were like lurking around or you were hopping from combo to combo but then when you brought every back together you go James will you tell people that amazing uh email trick that you did that uh really improved your your open rates and the guy said something that was like so useful to me that I was like that one thing alone made this party worth going to because it's like you had eyes and ears around the room so you could pluck the best kind of like Pro tip that you heard and you had two or three people go um and you just had them share with the whole group in that moment uh I thought that was pretty awesome that's an advanced tip and the main thing I want your listeners to know is that I found that interesting people want to meet people that are doing interesting things and the fastest way to become interesting was for me to host my own events so we talked before about those business ideas that you don't need a lot of capital for hosting events is kind of the same way you can do it with very little money each party should cost you less than $100 these strategies start from beginner to advance and I've helped hundreds of people to host their very first party using this method you should be going through life collecting the interesting people that you meet and why is this helpful well it helped me launch a multi-million dollar business called Museum Hack That was launched on the back of the network that I built up from hosting all of these events I hear from a lot of people oh my God I'm going to do a startup party I'm going to do a launch party for my new app I was like awesome perfect how many events have you hosted or when was the last event you hosted oh oh I've never hosted anything I'm like bro you have a cold list like nobody knows you like no offense but like in real life nobody knows you nobody cared this is not going to be a successful launch party you need to start building up and hosting these little events by the way the perfect size for a happy hour in my opinion is about 15 to 22 people I could talk forever about this but a small plug I wrote a book called the two-hour cocktail party that is really more like a workbook or a step-by-step guide that helps you actually do it and by the way if you want to go through a cohort or something you give me $100 at the end of hosting the party I'll give you the $100 back that's how it works but host might change your life the book made you like the king of the introverts because I had so many introverted friends um who like read the book and they started hosting nickr parties and I would be like walking around Austin at like seven o'clock at night and in Austin all the bars are outdoor bars and I would see I would I swear to God there was this one one mile walk through East Austin of like where all the bars are and I would see multiple Nick Ray parties happening harm Monica is all throughout downtown Austin Jo is the night they would be in a circle and they would we I call them we would call them name tag Nick so they always had uh Nick's name tags and they would be in a circle and I could see the person in the middle pointing exactly like tells you to do in the book I swear to God on one one mile walk I saw uh three I saw one at Lazarus one at whistlers and one this other bar it it was three Nick Ray parties it was insane it's like you were the introverts uh uh king for a handful of months when I would in in Austin so many of people were doing it the reason we're doing this is that people are hungry for in-person events we're all digitally saturated we want that human connection and I found that you can add value to people by introducing them to other interesting people if you're looking for a business idea if you're looking to raise your status in the world you have to start by adding value and hosting a party introducing the interesting people you know that is a way that you can add value dude you have so many stories we we probably should wrap up in a minute but you got like so many freaking stories I I just want I want you just to like rattle off stories I just like hearing all the most interesting things that happen even without explaining for the completionist can you just say what the C and the k stand for in the Nick method the Nick method n i c k n is name tags I is intros C stands for cocktails or mocktails only do not do a dinner party I talk about why dinner parties are a recipe for failure for new firsttime hosts and K stands for kick them out at the end this is only a two-hour Gathering you want to keep it tight you want people to leave when they're wanting more leave when they're wanting more end it when it's going great just like this podcast thanks for watching bye-bye [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I have a thought experiment for you imagine if you could just snap your fingers and suddenly there was a second version of you a second body brain your eyes your ears the way you think the way you operate but with one caveat one change it would do whatever you said to do you know what I would tell it to do I would tell it to go study the art of investing investing like Scott Galloway says is like having an army of capital go wage war for you right instead of you working for money your money works for you I love that so how do you get great at something well you would study the greats and that's exactly what the person who's coming on this podcast today has done he's gone back and for 25 years has studied everything that Warren Buffett Charlie Monger all the great investors what they have done read every single annual letter go and read all the reports study their how they grew from bit by bit block by block step by step and not just learn them in the book but then went and practiced it and so I wanted to ask this guy what did you learn about investing and what can I learn how can I spend an hour or two with you and download 10 years of your brain his name is Guy spear he's a very cool guy a lot of people really respect guy cuz he is a just incredibly humble interesting guy I think you're going to love this conversation so enjoy this episode with guy [Music] spear I have all these notes about where to start cuz I'm like oh he's value investing there's going to be good investing knowledge but the thing I was actually curious about when I was doing my research was about this group that you had called the posi oh yeah and I don't know if the posi still exist or this was just a moment in time but can you explain what was the posi who was in it what was it well what's happened to me is I've discovered that I love Warren Buffett value investing bathway so I want to be all over anything that's got to do with that and in New York City there's this Ruan conif firm that has a friend of Warren Buffett's two friends of Warren buffets that run it and they have a mutual fund and they have an annual general meeting and I get invited to some event before or after and there's a guy Whitney Tilson there who's like Master Network to the power of Master networker and we're introduced to each other and we're one year away from each other at Harvard Business School and the next thing I know he invites me to meet other people and he doesn't invite me to the group on its own he invites me to meet this person over there or that you're sort of like hey go have a coffee with that guy and so before I know I've met three or four members of this group and then it it was Whitney who put together uh a group of five or six of us who were all fascinated by Warren Buffett who all wanted to become better investors and we'd meet I think it was sometimes we'd meet even once a week in in one of our members offices there was a member that had an office in Midtown and we'd present ideas and Whitney's friend bill akman was part of that group for a while that's how I met bill akman for the few times I'd met him and I wasn't really aware of what that was or why well I I kind of we' had study group at business school and obvious you want to get together with friends who have common interest but I didn't realize what a powerful tool for Success it was until at that dinner lunch first meal with Mish pabai where he talked about forums YPO forums and he said you should you should get into one you'd benefit and then then I got switched on but uh but that posy met for about I think it met for two or three or four years and we're still part of an email chain I mean Whitney will send out an email send out a happy birthday message to the group some have become very very good friends of mine and some are uh I'm not even sure where they are now so you what was happening so you're meeting let's say once a week or every couple of weeks and you go to someone's office and you said you had you would all the commonality was you were all investors who were fans of the buffet style of investing value investing what would happen at these groups you show up what actually is there some structure did you just somebody's got a stock that they're interested in and you start debating it what would happen so what I what I remember is that you needed to show up up with a written a written stock idea everybody or one person just one person and then you discuss it in depth at that meeting then the following meeting another person would come with a written stock idea that you would distribute hand out give the handout and then you'd talk it through and obviously at the end of that like a half an hour 45 minute sort of talk through that there'd be various other ideas that were discussed but as a result of that what would happen I remember once sitting in a car with with Whitney driving somewhere in New Jersey to visit a company called is it was called iswe Interactive Services worldwide Inc iswi that had gaming software for TVs for example so there were sort of followon meetings that happened both social and business related or somebody would I realized this is at a time when transcripts of conference calls were not available so somebody would listen to a conference call and they'd make notes and they would pass them out by email for example so there's a kind of the structured part of those meetings but what is really really fascinating is that unstructured sort of like somebody mentions something or says something and I think that many of these best ideas come because somebody says something that is really fascinating so as a result of this uh I we're at a dinner somewhere bill was at this dinner and he started talking about mbia and he started talking about how the asymmetry of the bet on the credit default swaps on mbia and it was not I could have read that in a document I could have that but it was the way Bill talked about it that really stuck in my mind I thought wow that is really fascinating and so that kind of meta information if you like is is what you really get out of it can you tell the farmer Mac story because I think that was a a great example of what what came out of the yeah so there I am investing started off investing I'm Investing For Friends fools and family is I think how monish would put it so but I'm [ __ ] scared I'm very very scared because I really I don't know what I'm doing what's a Harvard NBA a guy pretends to himself in the world that he knows what he's doing when he actually doesn't you know but I knew that I didn't know what I was doing so you know so so you're looking one of the ways in which I approached that challenge was to look for people who did know what they were doing who were I thought they knew what they were doing and to kind of try and um uh unwind what they did to to backfill to reverse engineer what they' done and do the same thing so I I got all sorts of investment ideas through that and i' obviously I was studying Warren Buffett and I was also studying a guy called Tom Russo and I can give examples of for example Tom Russo was invested in Nestle and I started I kind of like wow Brands that's a really powerful way place to look where else can I find consumer Brands so you know Freddy Mack and Fanny May at the time were these um government sponsored Enterprises kind of a duopoly SL Monopoly highly highly profitable enormous ban sheets but were super successful at making money for their investors but also for organizing the mortgage Market in a way that made sense for everybody so there they are and so I'm doing what I normally do which or normally do which had made sense for me is look for similar kinds of situation because Buffett was invested in yeah so he was invested there you're looking at Buffett for ideas see you're saying what's similar to those all right real quick I want to talk to you if you are new to business if you are just getting started maybe you're new to this podcast you're trying to get out there and do your first business there's a lot of people who listen to this podcast that fall into that category and HubSpot has made something pretty cool for you most people in your first business you might do something like freelancing or being a solopreneur it's an easy way to get started you don't need to have a lot of money it's a great way to build skills and build that monthly cash flow but knowing where to start is not super easy the folks at HubSpot have created a kit that you can go download it's a it's a ultimate entrepreneurship kit for people who are really getting started in this journey they also have a solar preneurship guide that will give you sort of the mindset that you need to go on this journey check it out it's the ultr entrepreneurship kit the link is in the description below this video check it out and enjoy and I actually had an investment in Freddy Mack uh and uh uh was making quite a bit of money in Freddy Mack was very very happy with that investment and so I'm saying what other similar government sponsored Enterprises are there and I uncover Farm MAAC so farmer MAAC is also a government sponsored Enterprise and their goal is in the same way that Freddy and Fanny are funding the mortgage Market by buying these mortgage back Securities buying and issuing mortgage back Securities these guys were doing the same thing but in farms Farm loans so they would buy up Farm loans package them up and resell them with their guarantee and uh the claim was that they were reducing the cost for Farmers to borrow while at the same time creating valuable Securities for investors to buy and I thought wow this is incredible this is really really good and it's minuscule and I just freaking love this and so I think I probably did present on pharmer Ma and uh I kind of like sat down with the posy and said hey you guys check this out this is uh you know this is the next Freddy Mack and Fanny May except Freddy Mack and Fanny May are sort of like tens of billions if not hundreds of billions of market cap this thing's got a market cap of if I'm not mistaken maybe one or two billion and there's plenty of room to grow all that jazz maybe two or three later uh Whitney says to me you know that company you presented well I think Bill amman's either short it or he's about to take a massive short position and he wants to talk to you so I'm like okay so uh I I take the call from Bill and bill says look I just feel like I I need to tell you I kind of got the idea indirectly from you but I'm uh I've just taken a a massive short position in Farmer Ma and I feel like I need to tell you I think that the company is borderline fraudulent and um uh I was like okay you've got my attention you know there's a there's a saying who's wise he who learns from every man who's Wise Guy spear who learns from Bill Amman and I kind of said look you know this is important to me um can I just come down to your office yeah come on down he says prove me wrong prove prove to me that I'm wrong so I go down to his office and uh I also remember that the black file he had like sort of huge several meters worth of files where he had taken so every time one of these government sponsored Enterprises issues a mortgage back security it's kind of like a kind of like an IPO there publicly public filings available you need to know you know they're issuing uh debt on the one side to fund their asset purchases on the other so what are their asset purchases what are the terms of this mortgage back security and so he downloaded I I have to confess and I I hate confess in this but it's true I hadn't downloaded one I took them at their word and and you know we he kind of said look when you look at the the entities that are created by Freddy and Fanny each one of these mortgage back Securities has hundreds if not even hundreds thousands of different individual mortgages and the individual mortgage sizes would be anywhere from $50,000 $100,000 to half a million and uh and they're kind of like they're classes of mortgage and there's distribution across the country so these might be from east and west coast North and South different income categories he said I've downloaded I don't know he downloaded a number of uh the farmer Mac ones he said like there's there's three mortgages inside you said that doesn't create kind of the distribution the risk of spreading it's it's like it's just three it's like that's like a bank loan it's just three different things that have gone into a kind of a bank loan this is not and the mortgage sizes were far larger uh in and maybe three was an exaggeration but 100 or 200 rather than tens of thousands so much more risk yeah and he just said look this is business lending this isn't this isn't a mortgage back security there's no way you can call this a mortgage back security you know I debated him I said look it's got It's got a government guarantee behind it he said yeah it's got a government guarantee but what they're doing is they engaging in business related lending from his perspective this was a a lending against a business not lending against Real Estate and it just didn't deserve to be there so was he right I think he was right absolutely and and look uh what what was clear to me in that moment was that I had not done the depth of analysis that he'd done and I first of all I hadn't downloaded those documents I could have downloaded them I hadn't downloaded them or maybe maybe they weren't I could have located them and found them it wasn't as easy to find as it was would have been today but I could have found them and I'm kind of torn between wanting to stay and learn more and and rush back to the office and put in a Cell order and literally I mean I I got back to the office and I put in a sell order I I I knew I didn't know it well enough I knew that the points he made were good and uh and I sold it by the end of the day lucky enough the fund was small felt super relieved that I'd sold it and then uh either I or Bill or Whitney got a meeting with the management so what happened there was absolutely astounding to me actually the management came with its pre-prepared presentation and they were ready to go through the presentation and of course it's very dangerous when a management does that because they Lead You In the direction they they may not even do it consciously they're leading you in the direction they want you to go and bill says look I know a lot about the company I prefer if we dispense with the presentation we just go to the questions that I have for you they were a little nonplused by that but uh uh they they agreed to it they they didn't really have much Choice and then bill came with the same kinds of questions that he posed to me that I didn't have good answers for like why is this different to business lending how can you call this a class when there's only a small number of loans inside and they're all inside and when they're all of different sizes whereas a mortgage back Security will have you know many many many single family homes and they they didn't have any good answer says at some point the CEO said well maybe this might not be the right investment for you which is a pretty pretty weak I don't know if that makes it into my book but uh that was a pretty weak thing to say and I was kind of absolutely shocked shocked uh and it's one of the one of three stocks that I've shorted in my life actually when presented with a counterargument instead of Simply you know explain they should know their business better they should be able to answer those questions they just took their ball and said okay maybe don't play with us yeah exactly and look bill was a way better at that point a way better analyst than I was I had all sorts of other things I needed to be doing and just to keep my little business afloat so there are all sorts of good reasons as well for why I was unable to dive that deep but it showed how from time to time if you don't do the analysis all the way especially when you're going to a place where other people haven't been you're going to get it wrong there's an example that comes to mind when you say that in my life in the in the entrepreneurial sense but I I have a friend who is uh a good bud of mine and and a bit of a mentor to me we made a deal with one of my businesses to for him to help me out and so he says okay great I'll help you out I said um hey can we meet on Friday Friday comes around and I'm expecting I just thought this is how business works I thought we're going to meet on Friday so Friday noon that's when the the the video call will start and then we will start to talk and we'll discuss some ideas and then maybe after we discuss there'll be some actions and basically in the like 72h hour period before he just went to our site we have an e-commerce site and so he went to our site and said and just immediately opened up at Google doc and started writing uh a bunch of like really hyper tactical observations of things that were messed up in our own product there's a weird thing that happens with your own product where you spend so much time at the back of your business you never like use it as a customer whereas he just went and used it as a customer he went into our ad account and and he laid out this Google doc that was like two pages bullet point no fluff words in between it was just try adding this remove this this is missing hey you wrote this here but that doesn't this this link doesn't work in your ads try this segmentation strategy try this try this try this and he had laid out this two-page docket so by the time we showed up at the meeting I was like oh well I guess we don't really need to disc you already did an audit basically and told you Dove so deep deeper than I'm doing in my own business which was embarrassing for me at the moment but it was so useful and it became a real eye opener of like oh this is how the best people operate which is that when they're going to do something they just drill right in to the source of the of the issue if we're trying to grow the the answer to how we grow is going to be in the actual product mechanism and he went right there he found a bunch of opportunities and it was like there's nothing to discuss like make these changes and then let's see let's talk after that you know why would we talk before and it was a real eye opener for me and H how the best people operate they go straight to the Tactical stuff of like what could we just simply be doing better in the in the funnel what strikes me about that is that what extraordinary Act of generosity so he was giving you sort of like something that he was giving you the best part of his brain and he was giving it to you just out of the desire to give and and it feels to me obviously I wasn't there he's giving it without any agenda and uh just maybe he loves to do it or because he really cares about you or because he knows about a lot about the topic and and that that seems really special friend because there are people who know a lot but they just don't have the time they either don't want to have the time or genuinely don't have the time to talk to you about your stuff and so that that's pretty pretty special especially if he wasn't investor yet or he wasn't an employee yet yeah yeah I think we're we're both Tony Robbins uh you know uh I don't know fans or notic uh and he has a pH you know the secret to living is giving and he talks about you know almost like in the hierarchy of needs you get past yourself can you tell a couple of the lessons that you got from Tony or maybe that what what shaped you out of uh out of that CU you you like me are a self-improvement kind of infinite learner mindset person I think a lot of the audience because that's what I like to talk about is also wired that way I would love to hear maybe some stories or some some big takeaways for you so I think that in total I've I've done sort of like eight or nine Tony Robin seminars in my life including a big one in Hawaii and I'm just curious what what number are you on if I I want to know if you're more of an expert than me or vice versa no less than that I've I've been to two and so I've been to two or three two or three but they all they were all the uh upw you Unleash the Power Within I didn't do his like kind of deeper stuff but then I just kind of devoured a lot of his old material specifically like if you go on YouTube there's really great stuff of him when he was very young uh talking and you know not all of it is the stuff he talks about today but he has some really good stuff that actually for business people is useful about public speaking about um sales about marketing about persuasion and he he doesn't do a lot of that material now but that was some of my favorite stuff that he did back then so so that's where I'm at and I think that what what comes up for me as you say it is so you know there's this moment where in a way my destiny is um is on a knife edge with this meeting with Mish pabai and because I took the decision to to to approach him without an agenda I got a very different Mish to the person I would have gotten if I'd have approached him with an agenda and first meetings are always very important and so the decision to go to my first Anthony Robins seminar was a bit like that I had this really good friend in New York City who she says to me oh you're in San Francisco there's an Anthony Robin seminar there you should go it might change your life and I remember at the time because I had this weekend planned with friends I was like you know I'm going to go it's some where perhaps my deep wise the deepest wisest part of me knew that just to go hang out with friends would be something like same old same old whereas going to the seminar might give me something new so uh you know I I show up at this seminar Anthony Robin's like six foot something tall and you know and and he's getting us to uh jump up and down there's a huge amount you know as you've heard a thousand times anybody's done Anthony Robins Mo emotion has got Motion in it if you want to feel good about yourself you need to look at your physiology and look at how you're moving and change the way you're moving in order to change your emotions and I'm like this kind of snarky Brit at the back you know I'm just like what is this and looking at my watch and thinking why did I waste the money maybe I can still go out hang out with my friends but I did the firewalk and once I'd done the firewalk I was in a different place and so so for those who don't know he he kind of Whi those who want to be whipped up into a state in which you feel very confident to walk across a bed of hot coals and uh you walk across them and you don't get burned and you know there's all sorts of spiritual or non uh physical reasons I you know is I think that the main thing is is the state of mind that you're in and the firmness with which you walk if you walk in that way anyway it was like I it really did that metaphor of how if you have the right psychology and you have the right physiology there are extraordinary things that you can do as a human that metaphor went in for me such that I now stayed the rest of the weekend and in my case I was a guy who had my head up my rear end I was uh I had achieved some early academic success in life and I was getting to be quite bitter because I wanted success but the things that I'd learned the routines that I'd learned to get success and at this point I'm aged 27 28 29 they weren't working for me and I I I I'm sad that I see other people who are in kind of similar circumstances and I think the younger you are when failure hits you or when difficulty hits you the better it is because the more likely you are to develop strategies and to adjust and to try different things but I was at a point where I was kind of starting to get stuck in my ways and I really needed a very powerful kick in order to it wasn't enough that new things weren't working and Anthony Robbins did that for me and so after that firew walk I was really quite enthusiastic about everything that came out s after that and I couldn't stop talking about Anthony Robins when I got back to New York and started reading NLP and started neural linguistic programming and started like really diving into the self-help bookshelf to find more material that would help me in that way and I think that in my case I was so badly programmed for the kind of earlier part of my life that I needed you probably did fine with one or two Anthony Robbins upws I needed every single one and I'm and I'm super grateful to him for giving me that I mean you know there was a point on that first night where where he he kind he kind of said and and I bought it so there was the firewalk and he said look you think I'm here to make money out of you and he kind of said look I'm definitely here because it's a business and you guys have paid money to be here and there's a lot you know yes I definitely make money out of this but it's not the true motivation I really want to help you I really really want to help you guys in this Stadium get a different result from your life and and that actually I mean you know one of the books that Mish gave me to read when I first met him was this power versus Force book by David Hawkins and I went strong at that I he didn't strike me as just selling me a yarn I was like okay I I'm I'm willing to open myself to this he's he actually wants to I don't know if he can help me but he's at least that's the intention he's expressed and I believe him you know then what I knew was that I had an enormous amount of rewiring of myself that I had to do and and so I started doing that rewiring and it was that rewiring the process of rewiring myself and taking actions that I'd learned to do because I'd started doing Anthony Robbins that got me in front of mish pabai what would be an example of a rewiring so like a before my brain thought this way or worked this way and after so I I had this awful attitude that I was smarter than most people that I met and you know first of all I was way less smart than I thought I was you know and this that it's not important how smart you are it's how smart you are relative to how smart you think you are and I had this arrogant attitude that once I cat somebody as not worth my time I didn't really need to pay attention to them and there's there's a moment it's either in the seminar or one of the cassettes and at the time I was listening to cassettes of Anthony Robbins by the way I had a collection of the cassettes and there's the story that Anthony Robbins tells about walking up to maybe it's Norman Vincent Peele or another of these Health heel people and Anthony Robbins says look I've I've read your book and nothing's changed and and the guy says how many times have you read my book Anon Robin says well once he's like go read it five more times and then come back to me and so one of the books I picked up was Dale cari's book how to win friends and influence people that came well before I discovered that Warren Buffett really learned a lot from Dale carnegi and Dale carnegi sort of sits there and says the most important sound in anybody's mind is their own name what a freaking concept you know I was too busy trying to you know having studied law and economics and what have you and I was not connected to that but so so that's just the awareness oh my God you don't bother to remember people's names you don't remember bother to address people by their name is it a surprise that you're not getting the results that you want and so I I then made an effort and it it especially to somebody who grew up in the UK you in in the US people will do it a lot they'll meet you they say and they'll say how do I pronounce your name to make sure it's pronounced correctly and then they'll use your name a lot and it's struck me as being a little disingenous but actually I started doing it I made myself do it I said you know why this into yourself and around that time and this is not from Anthony Robbins I'd read the um psychology of influence and so I was like reciprocation reciprocation I need to do reciprocation I would buy bags of sweets and hand out sweets to like the Dorman to the taxi driver to whoever the hell it was so I had all these big theories of how the world worked from you know these great professors and writers of textbooks and what have you and I could spend hours writing essays about how the world worked but i' never really spent time understanding how one-on-one interactions work and how do you get people to feel positively oriented towards you on a micro level in real life you know and and it just like shocking look I think in my case there's a few things going on I think that I'm just that module is not very good it's not very welldeveloped in me uh I take my wife for example we'll go to some social events you say Do you realize the guy was you were standing too close to him or do you realize they wanted to go five minutes before you actually allowed them to go and I'm like no please help me and I think that I've made some progress just not something I'm very good at and yes we should specialize and the things that we're really good at but we need to be bring a few things up to the bare minimum Basics and there were a few things with me that I was missing that were just not the bare minimum Basics it's funny in your book you talk about how when you were young you were like this Gordon gecko wannabe I wrote that phrase down you're like I was a young Gordon gecko wannabe I wanted to be rich I wanted to be powerful I wanted to run Wall Street you join DH Blair which basically was like modeled after I think Stratton like the the thing the firm that's feat featured in Wolf of Wall Street like the penny stock in a firm and then DH Blair goes down a few years after you leave and you're at this point where you know you've gone to Harvard Business School you got the job on Wall Street you you wanted to have the slick back hair and all the money and the cars and the power and then you have this kind of Turning Point which is uh you know the Tony Robbins event which starts to get you to think about other things you go study NLP you study the Chini book about persuasion and you know how to win friends and influence people you start working on on other things there's a great Tony Robbins line where he says you know school is great but learning is more important and you know his point is that it doesn't matter what you what happens when you're in school like the point is to learn sometimes it happens in school and sometimes it happens out of school but the learning is the thing not the schooling yeah and so it's funny to me that it seems like you actually got your your Masters after you left Harvard Business School and and started to pick up all these other traits that were important to you can you tell the story of the the handwritten notes because I found this you know initially when I read this and I've heard this before I kind of wrote it off as this sort of simpleton cheesy idea and it's now coming to my life three or four times so what did you read in that book and then how did that lead to ultimately I think you meeting Mish was from a handwritten note also so can you tell that little story I think there's there's something I need to learn there because I've heard this three or four times never implemented it maybe this is the time so in the Chini book there is a story of the person who was the most successful car salesperson for the longest time and the way if I remember correctly Chini writes about it he just says he just wrote uh a thousand cards a year saying I like you and I don't know if he actually said I like you if you go and do an Anthony Robin seminar you'll learn about matching and mirroring and this idea that it's very interesting they had well the word like to like somebody and alike we like people who are similar to us and the the idea is if you just match and mirror what they're doing speak at the same speed wear the same clothes have the same hand gestures they will so I sort of say I literally I just said to myself because I'm feeling raw and angry in a way because because I want success and I'm not getting it and so I'm willing to try things that I haven't tried before and that's kind of key and in a way having gone to DH Blair I've burned my bridges I can't go back into all sorts of career choices where if I had not gone to DH Blair they would have had me so in a way I'm kind of desperate as well and with this idea well you know a thousand notes a year that's more or less three notes a day I'm not going to leave leave the office until I've written three notes that basically say I like you uh and so I realized that saying I like you feels a little weird and so you know but but thank you feels a lot better so I I I think I can do that and if I leave the office without having done that it means I actually don't want success that badly and somehow if I'd written those three notes I could forgive myself for not getting success if I did that thing I think that in a way that was me showing up and I just as an aside I I see people often their children of friends where they're not showing up for themselves and they're not even trying and I think the worst thing is to fail either an exam or some test that life gives you without having shown up so if you're going to fail fail fully and honorably by showing up and doing the best you can because then the failure means something that was my way of saying I desperately want success I'm even willing to spend the extra x amount of time at the office to write these notes because I'll if that's what what it takes to succeed then I'll do it and if I find something better to do I'll do that but for now leaving the office that's what I can do and actually funnny enough I remember in one conversation with Whitney Tilson he was like guy you know all of my friends are telling me you're writing notes it's like you think really think that's gonna get you anywhere in life it was kind of like kind of ridiculous and for some reason again I said to myself I don't mind looking like I'm a fool and I think I think many people inhibit themselves because they're afraid of looking a fool I really don't mind looking at least at the time I didn't so uh I didn't stop me from doing it and I just wrote endless thank you notes to people and even better or often better is to send them something that you know will interest them now can you can end up spending a lot of money if you're sending them each an expensive book for example but it might have been a print out of a transcript and I realized that actually often whatever I'm sending them I really didn't care genuinely about the people I was writing to I was doing it because I was going through the motions in a way I was faking it so then you know I'm writing note to XYZ person and I actually take the time to think about them a little bit and I realized that I the act of writing the note changed my insides made me care about them a little more so I was actually becoming more caring through the act of writing the note and this idea that sometimes you don't have to feel it to do it do it and you'll feel it later and that's absolutely fine that's a huge point right there I just want to add one thing uh almost going back to the Tony Robin thing he tells the story when you're at the event he's like okay uh we're going to play a game look around the room find everything red find as many red things as you can winner is whoever finds the most red things look around look for red look for red look for red look for red and all of a sudden you're looking around you see that the fire alarm is red you see that the chair is red you see that the screen has a little red thing on it you see red everywhere he says all right close your eyes and tell me about something blue and everybody laughs and it turns out we didn't see anything blue we were so fixated on red yeah and he said there's a part of your brain uh he said he's like there's a couple things there number one when I told you to look for red you suddenly saw so much red when I told you to look for blue when I asked you what was blue you saw none because you were only looking for red yeah and he says there's a part of your brain called the reticular activating system which is a it's your heat seeking missile it's the part of your brain that actually says ignore everything there's too much stimulus only pay attention to what matters but what matters is you get to program that yes and so when you're searching for when looking at buying a car and you're thinking about maybe I'll buy a BMW suddenly on the road you see that's that that's that BMW oh that's the one with the different Wheels that's the one with the trunk space and you start to see B it's not that the BMWs suddenly appeared it's they were always there but your brain had called them white noise before and now you've told your brain BMWs matter pay attention and so there's a how do you use this part of your brain to your advantage and so what you were doing with the notes where you said doing it will cause the feeling later which is if I'm going to write the thank you notes that means I need to thank them for something so I need to pay attention to something that I appreciate about them or I need to pay attention to what they're interested in in order to give them this note and you become suddenly a more caring interested person because of that gratitude works the same way I know I had this practice where every night I would say you know this me and my wife who would say all what's give me three things three things you're grateful for today moments of the day you were grateful for so not like I'm grateful for my family's health this abstract concept but like what was a moment of the day and at first it's really hard and you realize man I'm such a jerk I I don't even pay attention to my life uh you know how could it be that I just went through the emotion State and had nothing you do that two or three days and suddenly during the day you start stashing it you say oh that'll be one of my three things for the night you train your brain to look for things to be grateful for which makes you a more grateful person and that was such a huge unlock for me and what you're describing is essentially a a similar phenomenon a similar pattern where the act of writing the notes caused you to then be more interested in other people and genuinely care about them and you know what's interesting for me is there was a certain point at which I would get interns to do just that I'd just say your job as an intern is just to get a list together of people that you care about because they're and and write notes to them and you know I don't think that there's even one case or none comes to my mind right now where where somebody really implemented it and and it kind of like really frustrating for me because it's not a zero sum game it's not like if you do it and somebody else we know does it it may diminishes us it actually enhances all of our lives and it's not clear to me exactly why some people end up doing it and some people don't I would tell you that what just blows me away is that uh you know Warren Buffett gets this Warren Buffett is giving gifts to me he's writing the equivalent of thanky notes to me I'm a nothing in his life and he's not doing it every day he's not necessarily doing it every year but every two or three years I he sends me something or does something via his assistant like Warren Buffett is doing that you know wait really so Warren buff buff it sends you something like a thank you note or something like I mean it's like a holiday card but but here's the I mean I I don't know if we're doing video I could I have one that pull out so so do you let me step away for a second and pull it out and demonstrate it bear with me because because of course I have it up on my wall hang on a sec so uh Warren uh this is I don't know how many years after I've met him not right away that's for sure I get a holiday card from Warren in the post and I'm just going to put it up for a second and then we can talk about it it is so clever so uh let's see um uh you can see that and uh there we go yeah Warren Santa I can't read the text but I see Warren Warren Buffett with Santa so of course I framed it but the key there is is that it's a card which is I mean I'm going to look at it now because I need to remember so it's 2011 and he's crossed out Geico Burlington Northern Santa Fe and mlan and then sort of like companies that he maybe would want to buy it's got eggon mobile Wells Fargo Google and you know there's Warren next to Father Christmas there and but here's the key so he says either I finish this list by Christmas or I occupy the North Pole probably it was around the time of Occupy Wall Street but then what he's done is he's written he's scrolled on it and I don't know how many of these he's does every year guy happy holidays I enjoyed your 2010 report Warren and so you know what well you know so the key there is is like the other side's got nothing on it because who cares because you know maybe guys's going to frame it you don't want to put anything on that side and and what makes it special is he's personalized it to me and he's understood that that is an enormous gift to the people who receive it and you know I you literally this is a this is a mish expression you when I received that you needed to peel me off the floor I mean I was but and what am I to him you know really of all the people that he knows what am I to him he's had dinner parties with Katherine Graham in Washington where he's met heads of state and head of the Commerce department and the head of the central the Federal Reserve and now he's sending that to me and he's doing reciprocation he's giving out the equivalent of sweets he's giv out the equivalent of a thank you note he's showing this individual that he in some way just cares about me as an individual and he's doing it in pretty efficient way for him and in a way that allows me to get all excited and tell Shan Puri all about it in a podcast I mean he so he understands this stuff he freaking understands this stuff well I think that's amazing I did not know that he does that so that's very cool we had a guy jessle itler come on the podcast and he does this as well he I think he handwrites thousands of cards every year and he talks about the value in this um but you know I need to hear ideas four or five times before I actually go Implement them I'll tell you another similar story that's like this we met a guy who knew Kobe Bryant he trained Kobe's daughter before she passed away in that in that you know the tragic accident and I was like tell me some kobe stories and if you read on the internet all Kobe stories are like Nike Kobe they're Black Mamba Kobe which is basically about this ruthless competitor hard work kind of an [ __ ] on the court but like you know for the right reasons and and that was the brand there but this guy who actually knew Kobe told me like a a different side he's like and he's like Kobe would call my mom on her birthday he's like and who am I same thing who am I to him uh unbelievable that he would FaceTime my mom on her birthday I don't know how he even knew her birthday I don't know how he did it but like from that day forth you know my mom was the biggest kobby Bryant fan in the world another guy mentioned the same thing he said he told this story and I'll give you the short version which is he goes to this pickup game he plays with Kobe and the guy plays terrible and Kobe's like come on man are you gonna make a shot are you what's going on he's joking with him and the guy says hey man hey man I'm a volume shooter I need to take lots of shots okay it's not about making you high percentage I'm a volume shooter and so Kobe laughed and you know a month later they the guy comes in the gym Kobe's playing and Kobe turns uh sorry Kobe's playing his game this guy's helping out on the side eventually this guy's leaving and Kobe says hey man volume you're just gonna leave without saying bye and the guy's like oh I didn't even want to bother Kobe that's why I didn't say bye he's like I couldn't believe that this guy a stopped me to say by and B remembered that thing about me and the trainer asked Kobe he's like Kobe like you have you're amazing with people's names or remembering like one thing about them you know why is that and he said well you know feels good in the moment right but but beyond that he's like look this will be the only five seconds I maybe will ever interact with this person but for the rest of their lives they're going to tell everybody they know they might tell 3,000 people over the next you know the rest of their life about Kobe Bryant and he's like so it's so simple for so lightweight for me it's nothing for me right it cost me almost nothing and yet for them it can be a huge payoff and that they will go and tell the world about you know this amazing interaction they had so it's only 5 seconds for me but it might last years down the road yeah and it's same thing Kobe got it he he understood that well and I think that what's fun about these things is that you want to make it yours so you don't want to necessarily follow the guy spear formula well um I also want to ask you about investing because you know that's what you're known for I want to start with a quote from you that I found interesting I don't fully get it so I want you to explain it to me you said infesting is like being a drunk stumbling around at a bar trying to find a drink yeah and I think you were contrasting it to the idea of investing being you're like a fighter pilot you just scanning you lock your Target and you just you know laser beam it what do you mean by that I don't fully understand yeah so another I'm not going to get the terminology wrong because I'm not a big bowler but if you go bowling last time I went bowling every single ball I bowled went into one of those side channels it was very upsetting to me I mean I was really bad but then you if you're a child especially you can get them to put up curtains so that it doesn't go into the side Channel and uh you know it's this idea that you get on when I've the few times I've been bowling I want to hit the kingpen or the pen at the front and knock them all over and what a satisfying feeling and that's what you try that's what you think you're trying to do but actually you're just trying to keep it off the edges you know and anything that you can help you can do to stop yourself from having it fall into those edges where you kind of lose everything is a good thing and so spend less time time aiming for the for the for the skittle at the very front instead spend more time thinking just to keep it on the runway rather than in the sides and set myself up such that when I miss really really badly I'm still going to be okay that is more important than actually hitting on the targets it's going to be more important for me or for many investors not it's not the question of whether you select that winner it's going to be about how you run your portfolio in such a way that you don't have massive massive of losses you know we spend a lot of time being impressed with success impressed with people who seem to have succeeded whether it's companies like Google whether it's individuals like Jeff Bezos and a large enough number of others and this is this uh fo by Randomness idea of Nasim TBS that many of those people are lottery winners they were in the right place at the right time and yes they were working hard and yes they had all the attributes but also they were lottery winners and we need need to be really really careful when we study success don't study lottery winners and there's a well-known phenomenon that even the lottery winner subjectively thinks that they had some input into their success and the famous example there is that you get a room full of uh any number of people and you have them all flip coins and you keep them flipping coins they will after a certain number of flips be somebody who managed to to flip nine heads in a row 20 heads in a row depending on how many people there are and how lucky you are and in interviews and I I wish I could actually cite the study they ask the person who threw the nine heads and they're convinced they had something to do with it so this is just like a really really important phenomenon to be aware of and stay away from so how do I set my life up in such a way that given the enormous Randomness I succeed well enough no matter what and that is a is a far more laudable goal than trying to ape the success of somebody who won a lot fre ticket you know you said something in your book that that I liked you go I don't know what it is about me but when an idea captures me like I throw my my all into it like For Better or For Worse like if somebody you know it's the handwritten note thing right like okay that's the thing then I'm gonna do it all I'm all in on doing that and it see sounded like when you got interested in Buffett you didn't just read about Buffett or study kind of like his his high level philosophies it sounded like you went and you ordered the annual reports of the companies that he bought in the years before he bought them yeah to try to sit down as if you were Buffett and try to read them through his eyes can you describe this because I thought that was pretty fascinating I never heard somebody talk about something like that but there was something in there that to me felt like a valuable practice or a impressive version of really throwing your all into into something versus just tiptoeing around or Surface level investigation of an idea unlike what I did with farmer Mac for example just to get back to ear part of the conversation where I did not do that that's what I should have done but didn't and there's been I think it's been three times maybe four times in my life where I've lost sleep over something where I've sort of like I've stayed up saying I kind of want to do it now I wna I want to get my hands on anything related to it and that happened to me with Warren Buffett and Berkshire hathway sitting at this stratan Oakmont type Place DH and saying I want a life that looks more like that guys and I hate what my life is and then doing whatever the hell I can do to get closer to it in any in a in a way Sean in a in a sense of desperation you know there so the idea of this like this masterful person who sort of orders up the annual reports and goes through them carefully no it's a sense of desperation I'm so desperate I'll do anything even order his any reports because that's the only thing I got you know and so you know I my father kind of says to me I'm talking to him about this he says well why didn't you go and apply to him for a job why don't you go visit him in Omaha I'm like father he's I was a guy who was smiling and dialing pounding the pavement looking for deals for DH Blair he wasn't going to be interested in Mr gu bear showing up so I I felt like that was a dead end but I was doing what I thought were not dead ends and to understand everything I could about him was not a dead end and and it was absolutely instructive and I remember the feeling of you know getting the you know and you had to call up the company say I'd like to receive some copies of your annual report then they'd take your mailing address and then they'd mail it to you by by snail mail and now the an reports arrive and I'd never seen a company like this two years at business school I hadn't seen the accounts of companies like these and those it's funny because it's a it's a welln saying you want to buy companies that just drown in cash I hadn't seen you Coca-Cola company drowning in cash I mean just enormous amounts of money cash being generated way more than on the income statement and it's kind of like an embarrassment of riches and to somebody who's looks at the average of All American corporations if you spend your time with most American corporations you're not going to see the outliers like a company like Coca-Cola that really is just this extraordinary outlier and so it really was an eye opener to me and I kind of like my obviously my my jaw didn't actually was like I was like wow that's what this guy looks for that's like insane that's I I didn't realize I wonder what other companies like this exist so this is 1995 and Warren already understood so much because he was just sitting on Coca-Cola but you know and the story of Coca-Cola is as I understand it is that he' bought C candy and C candy opened his mind up to these businesses with pricing power powerful brand that people don't want to switch away from but yeah and so obviously I I was going down a steeper learning curve than Warren Buffett had been down if you like so and so you you order these reports you're reading them you're trying to understand what he looks for and then was there anything else that was formative at that time for you to develop the mindset of a value industri to sort of immerse yourself and speedrun this education to try to really level up so one formative thing sounds like ordering reports sitting down I think you even described it like sitting down like Buffett like walking like him talking like him drinking the drink that he sit down with Diet Pepsi or whatever he drinks and and really trying to you know sit in their shoes for a minute um was there anything else that was very formative in in your development there just two things there so one is that um obviously drinking the diet Cooks is not necessary and you know eating Stakes or whatever but reading the an reports is for sure and so when in doubt do it all and then maybe over time you'll figure out what's meaningful and what isn't but drinking The Diet Cokes really isn't that important but also I think that and and I just get excited to think about this doing that goes to the very very core of our Humanity as a species because that's what we do we learn from generation to Generation by modeling I mean this matching and modeling matching and mirring in Anthony Robin's case cloning as as as Mish PAB calls it is a very very human thing to do that's what we do that's how girls daughters learn from their mothers hunters learn from their Elders so so I was doing something that was kind of natural very very natural in a way it's very unnatural for us to send people to University to have the model professors who don't know anything about business if their plan is to go out and be business people so there are two sort of uh insights that I had that I subsequently realized were good insights about uh what to do the one was you know so I can't get Warren Buffett as a mentor for me much as I would like him as a mentor for me but if he was my mentor what would he say and this beautiful idea that we often all of the time maybe we don't actually need the real person we need to know enough about them to know what they would say if they were present and so this idea of me ask saying what would if if Warren Buffett was here right now if he was in my shoes what would he do and I think it's funny because I don't want to live a life like Jeff Bezos lived actually at the end of the day so I've never asked myself the question if I was Jeff Bezos what Jeff Bezos do in my shoes but I think it's a just an unbelievably powerful question and uh and help me get going and this is this technology of success that I think that Tony Robins would call it the technology of success that in a sense I wish that we could teach it at school you know because they because in a way it's success by numbers it's it's not that hard you know imagine that the person you admire is in your shoes what would they do now try doing that see if it's working for you it might well work for you can can you give the uh I think there a monish thing I don't know or maybe he got it from somebody else the two gas stations across the street I thought this was a great metaphor so yeah it comes from um a good to great so yeah it's a beautiful uh idea that I haven't thought about for for an enormously long time the idea is and this is a story I think is in his is in his book good to Great uh two gas stations opposite both opposite sides of the road and the guy in the gas station you know when he gets a customer he's made some money he Paints the wall of the gas station he puts out some flowers he uh makes his gas slightly cheaper and these are all actions that the guy on the other side of the road opposite him could do not only could he do he's seeing the other guy do it right in front of him right in front of him and the fact of the matter is that in so many cases in life the guy on the other side side of the road who has all the opportunity to do exactly the same thing as the winning gas station just doesn't do it and uh you you come to this situation n years down the road and it's very hard to understand why one is so successful and the other isn't and so you know the the way I think I tell the story in my book is you I'm sort of sitting with Mish and he's told this story a few times now and I'm like yeah yeah what a dumb guy on the other side of the road he isn't copying any of the things that the that the the one with the successful business is doing and and I don't know exactly what happens when I actually you're the guy on the other side of the road because here's Mr monish pabai doing all these things and you're not doing any of those things why the hell not don't be such a freaking idiot what was something Mish was doing that you should have been simply copying oh that guy uh you know he comes out and washes the windshields of people giving G getting gas and they love it and that's why you know that little action is leading to success what was something that was a little action you could have copied you know getting a around the right people so something and it's taken a while for this to kind of seep into me and now I kind of feel like I I own this phrase or I I'm fully familiar with it so Mish will talk about a sales engine or a marketing engine and maybe for those you know in a sense Sean I've never built a big business I just have a little investment shop with five people I'm like the little watch maker you know and I have a few people helping me make watches but you know the realization that what I need to do is break down the actions that I see need to be taken into repeatable steps and then build an engine around them so that means uh enable people around me not just me to do those things and then to scale them up and do them in a larger volume so there's a there's a limit say to to how many thank you notes you can write but uh but but if you kind of like decide that you're going to generate Goodwill in a certain way how can you scale that up in what ways can you do it in a way this this value x uh event that I do every year or this um this value X BRK is a way of scaling up Goodwill and building an engine for creating the kind of good feelings that you want to create inside of people and so that idea of building an engine what engines do you have what engines are firing up inside your business is is certainly straight from Onish PAB right another huge thing huge huge thing for me was the realization that I was investing enormous amounts of time talking to prospects and that in a certain way that was an enormous waste of my time and it just blew me away when I discovered that Mish didn't waste any time talking to prospects basically if you weren't ready to invest with monish he didn't want to spend time with you and he had an engine of how people were going to find out about him and so you know I re and and then the first time I implemented that when I declined a meeting I said well if you're not invested with me I'm not going to meet with you was huge actually so I was going to say you know I'm there in my office I'm reading the the Coca-Cola any your reports I'm saying what would Warren Buffett do in my shoes and then there's get around the right people just find a way to get around the right people no matter how um spirous you think that connection is so for me and it really was a great distinction for me I was so desperate for success I was so frustrated I said well if I'm going to travel to the b i away meeting every year and that's going to get me a little Clos to Warren Buffett I'm going to do that but I actually think that my annual pilgrimage and it's correct wording to call it a pilgrimage and I can get into it if you like to go to the Bur haway meeting every year has exerted a really really powerful positive gravitational pull for me in the right direction and again I think that I get super excited about that because these are not genius moves they're not like sort of I had to be so capable so smart all of those things it's something that anybody can do you know oh I want to live a life that's more like the life of Warren Buffett I'm going to start going to his annual meetings because that's going to rub off on me in some way and what's interesting is I could have in that moment that time around 1995 said oh but I don't ever want to live in Omaha I hate the coffee in Omaha there are many things about Warren Buffett that I actually not big fan of there are all sorts of things that I love doing that Warren Buffett has no interest in doing and and I see that stop people and it's like the fact that I'm going out to Omaha doesn't mean I'm about to turn into Warren Buffett it doesn't mean I'm about to live his life it's still going to be my life I'm still going to do the things that I like to do but I'm going to have that rub off on me and that's in my view what a real pilgrimage is all about and it's about regularly getting together getting around people who are the kind of tribe that you want to become more like and that's just Destiny in there you know right you bumped into Buffett right at the uh you're a close reader of my book it's a true story is just hilarious so this was the meeting where they were voting in the B shares there hadn't been B shares up to this date and I don't remember the name of the location it certainly wasn't where it is now the big Stadium or the big Convention Center downtown uh and um I'm in the stores I'm going to the toilet and out comes Warren Buffett and he turns to me he says he just he's clearly done a number two because otherwise you wouldn't have been in the stores I always get a little nervous before those these things before he goes off and again this was one of these moments where I just like dropped to the floor as I couldn't believe it my hero was just standing there and look why did he talk to me this was not he was not in the streets although I've heard stories of him showing up at people's parties in in in Omaha I mean well known around town at least when he was younger he was talking to me because he felt like he was amongst family he was with a Burkshire shareholder and therefore he was family I was family to him and but that was a you know I'm there dressed in a suit I'm I'm Mr New York investment banker I've got an MBA I mean I'm still got all of that wiring going on inside of me but that was that was kind of like a uh what would Anthony Robins call he broke my patn right right well I have a question so you have your fund and and I think you own a bunch of Burke B in your fund right it's like 20% of of your fund and Buffett doesn't take any Buffett Burkshire doesn't have any management fee or any carry right you're just buying a piece of bathway if you do that why this is kind of a a silly question a stupid question but like if all the fund managers sort of idolize Buffett and I think most would say I I might not be better than him or as good as him but I you know I will try to learn from him as much as you can why would anybody buy anything besides Brookshire if you wanted to do value investing you know people say well should I invest in bsh hathway or should I invest in the index because they say look I think that Warren Buffett's getting older B hathway just hit a trillion in valuation and you know I think the index might be better and one of the things that I want to say to them is look realize that the index is impersonal and you might get spooked out of the index and I I think that many people if they buy Burkshire shares and they attend the Burkshire meeting and they they really kind of become closely connected to the company they're more likely to be in for the Long Haul and be in for the ride and so it's not just um the choices whether to buy Burkshire or to buy the index for example it's how do I impact my own behavior through my investment actions and the realization that when we invest if we buy Burkshire or we buy the index we buy something else we're also making our own bed and we're also creating the environment in which we'll be in and we're in a kind of a relationship with these things what I discovered when I shorted uh uh farmer Mac just to go back to that one of those Original Stories was that I became all twisted inside I kind of didn't like my internal wiring when I was doing that Berkshire hathway strengthens my internal wiring ing in the right way and and it's I think it's a really important question to ask if I become a shareholder of this thing or if I buy this asset what does that do to me as a person how does it improve or or deteriorate my thinking and that's the reason to own burer and uh and I actually tell people that's a reason not to own the index because the index is unbelievably impersonal you you'll get manipulated into all sorts of things well the other thing I want to ask about is just performance so you uh so I asked my guy helps me with research I said okay what's the performance let's say of your fund over the Long Haul and it looks like you basically beat the beat the S&P 500 by some amount I don't know the exact numbers but SLI n and a half% versus eight and a half% or something along those L is that right like since you started it's about it's about 80 basis points at this point great uh and is that by the way is that net uh certainly net it's net of everything yeah net of everything cool so good job that's uh that's something that's obviously very hard to do is to beat the index over a uh 25 years yeah more than 25 year timeline so that's super impressive at the same time in the last 10 years I don't think you've beat the SP 500 in most of those years but that's a long time I'm thinking put my putting myself in your shoes man the psychology I don't know what I would do you know Bas I I would just be running around with my head cut off like basically if I over a 10-year period yeah wasn't doing the main thing I wanted to be doing or you know and I felt this by the way in my 20s I wanted to be a successful entrepreneur and for eight straight years I failed yeah and I remember what that felt like at the time it was crushing Soul crushing for me to to be doing that I wonder how do you manage your psychology in a period of time where your performance is not as good as you want because you seem like a really well balanced well-regulated emot you know emotionally regulated guy but at the same time this is the game you're playing and how do you manage psychology during a window of time like that so yeah it's a it's absolutely spectacular question it's funny because I did a sort of dry run through I'm going to be talking about uh the fund to our investors in in a day or two's time and I think it's like it's seven or eight years that I've underperformed the S&P index in this case and so I don't know why it always comes up for me when I think of this is the question that was asked me just after ID published my book and I was invited to give a talk at Google and uh the out performance was looking better at that point than it was it is right now and a very smart engineer asked the question how do you know that the out performance you've gotten to date is not luck and my answer then as as it would have to be now is we don't know I'm just one data point and amongst thousands of data points and so you know you you would argue that 25 years is a long period of time but eight years of underperformance in that 25 years is also a long time and so you know this was already a year or two ago where I said um in the face of underperformance what am I going to do am I going to say this sucks this isn't working I need to Str change my strategy and risk uh everything that's dear to me potentially or I'm I going to say look I understand what I'm doing somehow the Market's not rewarding it the way I would like it to be rewarded but I know that what I'm doing will in the even in the worst possible cases lead to a really really good life even if I am underperforming and if I take for starters you know the My First Investors friends and family had never invested in equities before so in their case even if they're underperforming the S&P they're vastly outperformed that what they would have gotten in fixed income and all the cash instruments that they have there they've won many many many times over and and I actually got to have I like to Call it Courage where where I kind of realized that the key is to compound and to take make moves that I know will enable me to compound and if I can end up beating an index then that would be great but but I cannot jeopardize compounding for the sake of beating the index I have to focus on compounding and and that leads and and if if you step back I mean I think that you know this this idea of playing the infinite game so many people think they're playing a finite game but they're playing an infinite game explain the difference finite and infinite games yeah yeah sorry so so uh finite so so this clear distinction between finite and infinite games a finite game is one which has a clear set of rules a clear uh space in which it's played out both in terms of time and physical location so an example would be chess there's a set of rules it's played across the board and there's a winner and a loser according to the time controls or a game of American football it's played in American football pitch there are nend players each side the game starts it ends there's a winner there's a loser declared according to the rules and but the thing is the most important things in life are infinite games what is an infinite game an infinite game has no clearly defined rules no clearly defined game space no clearly defined time when it begins and ends and one of my favorite examples for an infinite game was the Cold War the Cold War was fought across many battlefronts whether it was the southeast Asia or you know building nuclear missiles or rivalry between the superpowers in all sorts of ways it didn't not really clear exactly when it started and here's the thing and it played itself multiple rules multiple places the in in the infinite game you don't really win or lose usually one or more of the players just decides to drop out in the case of Russia Russia kind of in a way imploded and dropped out of it what's the most important point the key the key mistake that we make so often in life is we think we're playing a finite game when we're playing an infinite game life is an infinite game investing is an infinite game so how many people I would tell you out of I don't know how many funds that were around at the time that I started how many around today and it's like less than 2% now some of the people left that game of investing because they actually were utterly superb made enormous ounts of money and decided to go and do something else a famous example of that is Nick sleep he's in William Green's book and and so that those people there were those people but I I did a study of this about 10 years ago and there was a lier database where I could look up all the funds that were around at the time they don't really give their reasons for dropping out if because but in many cases it because they had an an implosion of one kind or another and so you don't want to be the guy who employs well I mean I I enjoy listening because I think what's cool about your mindset and is very different than the environment that I live in which is you I've lived in Silicon Valley here for the last 12 13 years is everybody here wants to be Zuck everybody here wants to be Elon everybody here wants to be in in your case it would be Buffett right and the Venture Capital game is a you win and you get all the glory or most likely you you know you fizzle out and lose and um my life really improved when I as myself what game do I even want to be playing and I moved basically an hour outside of Silicon Valley which helped just to not be right in the center of it and you it seems like what you're trying to do is not be the next Warren Buffett although if it ha if if your performance actually happened to be the way it's not you would be be annoyed by it but your goal is compound well and live well yeah and I think that that is a much more achievable goal that you've been able to achieve versus putting your happiness or selfworth to to some moonshot type of outcome and I think I really respect that about you because I think it's it's not going to get movies made it's not going to get articles written about you you're not going to be in the cover of Forbes with that attitude but those are the people who you know the guy swimming in the lake happily um you know with his kids who's living well and gets to do what they enjoy every day reading and writing and talking and to me that is a life well-lived and I had to almost deprogram myself from the media I was consuming which was kind of shaping me to want something that I didn't really want especially once I knew the odds of success in that game and so you know it really helped me to shift my thinking that way so you know you're a good example of that for me if I do the same contemplated action given the same set of circumstances throughout the rest of my life how's it going to turn out so there's this sort of like just this once Justus this once do this just Justus this once get blind drunk just this once drop out of an airplane with without a parachute because it'll be fun and just to ask the question and for me for example just take this meeting just help this person just give this person a uh an internship and uh I think that something that is helping me to say no more often to those things to say well if I in every time I'm faced with these circumstances I say yes to this how will my life look and if every time I'm faced with these circumstances I say no how will my life look and it it makes it far easier to come to a quick no and an understandable no where I can say to the other person look I'm sure you can understand I can't say yes to this and and I'm sure you can understand because if I did here would be the consequences and so and I think that that's a huge part of Warren Buffett's wisdom never ever fall for the justi this once another one of those is if everybody in the world did this contemplated thing that I'm contemplating on doing what would the world look like and I think that a world in which everybody's trying to be Zuck is utterly miserable really really miserable by contrast a world where everybody is writing their own story a world in which everybody's trying to discover some a new scientific discovery uh that is a really really beautiful world and it's possible it's really possible you know uh so so I'm I'm doing a sort of part-time a history degree for fun and uh so I've been thinking quite a bit about Empires you know and and we kind of like I think the way that we feel today across the planet is that Empires ought to be a thing of the past there was a period when Empires were built we don't want to build Empires like the Roman Empire or the Persian Empire or many different Empires that were around do we you know we could imagine a world where every man every every working person is doing the equivalent of being a watch maker or a novelist why does it have to be on a grand scale you know so long as the work that you're doing is satisfying and you're creating something that that is of beauty overs worth it has its worth in itself isn't that a more beautiful world actually yeah that's a it's an interesting point because also the other side is true too which is if nobody was Zuck if nobody was Elon uh then we would also have a problem and so I think the answer isn't be one way or the other but like you just said what what is the satisfying version of life for you and if you could figure out that answer for yourself and just act in accordance with that that's really powerful I think for somebody like Elon this this is the satisfying version of life for him I don't think he would be satisfied doing what I'm doing or what you're doing and so I think we need that sort of the ecosystem has to have that diversity in order for it to work I I think it's a great point you just said like this it's almost like this action in The Limit you know if every time I was in this circumstance I did this thing if every time I was craving chips I ate chips where does that lead me yeah if if everybody did this action if everybody just took from the cookie jar what happens there's nothing left right and so I think that there is a that's a very powerful question that simplifies I'm a big fan of single decisions or Frameworks that simplify thousands of future decisions yeah and that seems like one of them we should wrap up with this can you just leave me with I am a newbie on my what I would call the buffet Munger school of thought which is around partially around investing partially around how to conduct oneself how to avoid you know the trappings uh you know what was the theer talk like the before common causes of human misjudgment yeah yeah causes of human misjudgment so things like that what are the best essays that I should go read if I was going to go read three things what would you point me to the kind of the the Pinnacle you know either essays letters blog posts could be books but I'm looking for the shorter version if you have them I'll give the an the answer that I think most people want to hear and then I'll give a non-answer which I think is more valuable uh but I'll start with the actual answer so you know I think you got to go to the SCE you got to go to the buffet letters you got to go to the transcripts and all the recordings of the annual meetings which are phenomenal and obviously as as you brought up I think that that poor Charlie's Almanac really is just an incredible collection of stuff that is that's not too much and some of it can just be listened to online but it's it's it's an amazing start but so there's there's the answer which is kind of pretty straightforward but then what I want to give is a non-answer which I think is far more important which is that I can't tell you or anybody else what to read because you're a different person in a different space your brain is a different so so people say what can I read to learn about dot dot dot the answer is you know pick up 20 books that you think might lead you in a good direction and go through them quickly and ask yourself the question once you've kind of flicked through and read a few pages is this getting me somewhere or not if it's getting you somewhere keep reading it and if it's not put it down maybe tomorrow will be a good day to read that book and I really do believe that we like is too short and our reading time is too short to force ourselves to read things that aren't giving us win after win after win and so if you go to the buffet letters and it's not speaking to you put it down quick don't waste your time don't have that sense of obligation that you're supposed to be reading go go use up your valuable brain energy your to on something that really works for you so what I really want to say is you know start with any reading list but start iterating quickly basically yeah I like that that that is the answer I needed not the answer I wanted uh which is good you have a good quote by the way that that stuck with me you said I treat my library like a cocktail party uh you know you're going to mix and mingle and hop from one conversation to the other and if it gets boring you go grab a drink I love that metaphor because I I also am a promiscuous reader and I just didn't have the the right mental model or metaphor for for how to treat you know this this stack of books that's here in my room but I think a cocktail party is is a good one guy thanks for doing man this is a really fun conversation that I was looking forward to and I got to say one thing about you that's really cool probably I'll leave you just with a compliment which is I texted a few people before this that you were coming on I said give me uh what's a good story or nugget and I was disappointed at first because they didn't give me like a specific oh you got to ask him about this which is what I'm looking for it's a it's a shortcut for me in my research but the the way people talk about you is incredible you're like a mench right like people just have such a high regard for your character and who you are as a person to them like what's a brand it's what what people say about you when you're not in the room what's a reputation that's what people say about you when you're not in the room uh your brand your reputation is very very strong amongst people I respect the way they think about you is is that you are sort of um you know just such a value Giver so you know congrats to you on that that that is it showed me something that I can strive for like oh how would people talk about me if somebody asked them in this way would they would they do this today I don't think honestly no that's the answer is no they would not talk about the same way but that became a bit of an aspiration well I'm delighted and that's extraordinary kind of them whoever hell said that thank you so much

well let let's do it so part two okay here's part two with George if you wanted the business ideas we did that five Banger business ideas that was amazing I got like Goosebumps from it this is part two we're going to do some of your Frameworks the biggest one I think the one that went the most viral is about high [Music] agency you did a threat about one idea I think I think you framed it like one idea that has impacted my life the most is the concept of high agency can you talk about what is high agency why it matters and how you spot people with high agency so high agency something I've probably thought about for six to seven years and it's one of those topics when you search it it's quite difficult to find online which is why I then just started writing about it to scratch my own itch and the way I would describe High agency is if you was stuck in a third world prison cell and had to call somebody to break you out who would you call and that's probably the most high agency person that you know so I mean thought experiment time now who do you guys think of when I asked that question my friend Jack Smith uh that's a tough one feel like I would just go for the richest person I know because I'm like the money is going to be the most valuable tool versus like a mcgyver who's goingon to break me out of my cell so Steve B Steve B answer that question with Prince William which I think's not allowed so it can't be somebody who's like a royal family member but it has to be purely on Merit well you know what the the meme you have in the tweet I think is a great visual of this Sam if you've seen the TW I I don't know if you've seen the Tweet but he basically the one where uh where he tells he's like if someone says something's impossible a high agency person will think well that's just a story you've told now I'm going to overcome it versus a low agency person will be like oh that story is true I think that's a clue in it but I'm talking about the the very first picture that he has in the Tweet is basically two guys stranded on an island one guy they have these like pieces of you know wood basically that they have from the from the from the island one guy is using the wood to spell help so that somebody if somebody flies over they'll or boat sees help that they'll come save him and the other guy just made a made a boat out of the wood and the high agency is the guy who will make the boat out of the wood and most people just put out a sign for help and they're kind of the victim and they're they're looking for somebody to come and rescue them I guess if I had to trim it that like think was the adverb for high agency that we spoke about last time would be high agency people people or low aesy people are they happening to life or is life happening to them it's a spectrum right like the circumstances there's there's different things that go on but you can immediately plop that XY axis in your head of people that you know of people that are like happening to life and people that life's happening to that and so why does the why does the idea of high agency matter so much to you you said you've been thinking about for six or seven years that's probably longer than your longest relationship tell me why you have why you have had such a long relationship with this concept I I think it's the most underd discussed personality trait and it's the most probably important personality trait and this most similar concept that I've seen online is have you seen Paul Grahams relentlessly resourceful yeah well he just says like I've created YC I've now seeing thousands of Founders and if I think about the trait that is most valuable in Founders it's not intelligence it's not Charisma it's not uh you know engineering prowess it's the you know the best Founders are relentlessly resourceful and that that phrase and he also says like can you describe you know a test is would you describe this person as an animal would you say yeah he's an animal and if you can say man that guy's an absolute animal or she's an animal when it comes to this that's the sign of a winner and I think that's the the output of a high agency person is how do you describe them they're basically they're an animal yes and he has a great bit in there of inverting it which was what would be the opposite and it would be hapless which is probably a good case of Life happening to them and I think there's a few there's a four kind of tenants I would say why High agency is probably not a sticky idea as much as it could be because it kind kind of has four ideas in it which is one locus of control so I have control two intentionalism so they've thought about the direction that they want to go in three resourcefulness which is I'm capable of getting the outcome and then four high bias for Action which is they've already [ __ ] started the thing before they've even listened to this podcast they're just constantly moving so those four things and it's I think it's not changeable it's sort of are like telling people um they should have started a business before they had children it's like dude like we don't I don't like talking about that because like you can't [ __ ] change that like you are what you are uh you know what I mean um it's not particularly fun to talk about because I think that on you you you have that scale already set I disagree I think go on tell me change my mind there's definitely some truth to what you say and also that's quite High agency reply right there's definitely some truth to what you saying that I think there is a little bit of a genetic component to it but theoretically I think you could make somebody you could reduce somebody's agency therefore if you can reduce somebody's agency you could also increase their agency it's probably like muscle building there there's a genetic like component to it but I still think everybody can increase or decrease their agency depending on the inputs that they put into the system I had a tweet once that um that went kind of viral about this where I said one small poker tail for if an employee is going to be great is if they're willing to spend money out of their own pocket to move faster they're not doing it to impress you or to take one for the team and it's not the money that matters it's that this person simply cannot stand being blocked or slowed down sharks die if they stop swimming and I said this because we hired this woman in our business and she is so good we've promoted her two times already in probably two years she now basically runs a huge part of the business and she's awesome and one of the things that I noticed is that not the not the spending money part I noticed we will be talking about an idea and it looks like she's not listening cuz she'll start like typing on her computer and then I'm like yeah so just send that over to me she's like I just did and I'm like what and she will literally do it before the the words are done out of my mouth and she cannot help but taking action like her bias for Action is so high that it's almost annoying uh it's so high that you're like hey can we just stop can we just talk first before you go finish the thing but on balance it is so much more valuable to have somebody who's that high action because they just get more done that they're she's like 12 people she is literally like an entire team herself because she will make decisions very quickly she'll immediately implement it and then she'll fix whatever's broken so quickly before the other person has even got out gotten out of bed and I think that that's a it's a trait that I that I now look for in hiring as well but you said something that's interesting you said it can be taught so how do you develop High agency EMT from twitch has a flowchart that's really cool of like literally a question by question by question of how to develop somebody's agency with time I think I would use the midwit meme algorithm of how would I make somebody low agency and then avoid that so if I was to make somebody lower in agency I would make them hypergen I would use no deadlines I would not break things down into step-by-step instructions um so I would go through the list of how to make somebody low agency first and foremost and go through that I'd say it's it's much it's much easier to spot in other people as well so I look at who are the most high agency people that you know and then trying to reverse engineer the values and behaviors they have then try to analyze yourself because it Loops back to the first episode where self analysis um is not that useful in terms of the job interview questions as well Sean like one of my favorite ones that I've told a few Founders and they go this is awesome of asking for weird teenage Hobbies because if they can go against the crowd when they're a teenager so much easier as an adult it's tough but it's easier and I have one founder who voice bam me the other day and he goes I pre-screen all candidates with that and it's like the best quality filter of potential people of potential High Dy people we on this podcast it's a question I ask a bunch I say you're awesome like I'm so inspired by this right now well if I had met you or i' had been able to to observe you when you were 12 13 years old what would I have seen would I have had any clues that you would become this kind of outlier type of person a couple people have said some pretty interesting answers so uh Jess ma who came on and Jess ma is a super impressive entrepreneur I think Paul Graham had said like you know the five most you know impressive or if he had to bet on five people in YC it would have been like Sam Alman the cisin and like Jess ma was one of the five and she said like she's like yeah basically I was kind of a runt in school I wasn't that good at class I kind of got picked on and I was weird but I created like I liked gaming and I basically created a server farm for my favorite game I started charging for it and I was making basically like tens of thousands of dollars renting out server space for this game back when I was you know 14 years old and we had s bulky come on this guy's built basically a billion dollar bootstrapped business which is so unfathomable to to be able to do and somebody told me that you know they go ask S about when he was a teenager and he hacked his school's system so he could just change his grade like he was willing to do the work to hack into his school system to like be able to change his grade versus just study for the thing and get a good grade and guess what that's also a guy who basically like found other grow hacks along the way to grow his business incredibly fast without needing any capital I was with a guy this weekend and he's a friend and he um told a story he's a new friend though but he told a story about how he got in trouble when he was a kid because he built this thing that allowed him to remote control a street light near his home and then he goes on like a a few hours later to talk about his new business idea and I remember like him getting in trouble for controlling the street light near his house and how his mom like grounded him for 3 weeks and I'm like I'm in and by the way YC has a a one-page application and in there so so every question in the YC application has to have earned its right to be there if you're on the one page there only like seven questions one of the seven questions is tell us about a real world system that you've hacked for your benefit right not not literally hacked but like any real any system in the real world that you have sort of gamed in order to do it they because because that's a high predictor of relentlessly resourceful as we talked about all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show George what's the answer for you uh like did you have weird teenage Hobbies yeah my um it might not translate as well it's American audience but my dad bet me I couldn't do 10 kick ups with a soccer ball and puberty just hit so testosterone was in ass system what pickup by the way like sort of a juggle with a soccer ball okay gotcha so my dad bet me I couldn't do that uh 10 pounds and testosterone just hit like first bit of armpit hair and I remember thinking [ __ ] that guy I'll prove him wrong so I trained and I trained and I trained and he he didn't cool parenting had by the way he didn't try and push me to do it he just bet me whether I could do it and he made sure that he had to see me do it anyway ended up doing it and then I kept doing it more and more and I ended up being Adidas advert for a FIFA World Cup I used to tour around doing tricks at different stadiums held like three unofficial world records for different trips and things like that so and then ultimately I decided I wanted to lose my virginity so I stopped doing it um but it was uh yeah really fun did it did it work giving up still trying but somay say yeah tends to work out that way Sam what about you did you have weird teenage Hobbies uh yeah I I basically like small predictable things like I I had an eBay store when I was 12 or I remember in fourth grade small or predictable well yeah like I mean things that I think you would expect me to do knowing me um I also like in fourth grade when I when we had to pick a book to do a book report on I did how to win friends and influence people like like I I was like a weirdo like I I liked I I enjoyed the stuff that I like now back when I was 12 years old that's amazing like funny you're like listen up class Dale cigie has said that your own name is the most beautiful word in the English language so say it with me you know what I mean like yeah I was into like that were you into anything you know when I first heard this I felt really bad because I was like I I did couldn't think of anything special that I did monish PAB was on the episode and he basically said there's a golden period he studied like I went to his house he got this whole wall of books on science and brain chemistry and all that neuroscience and he was basically like there's a like a golden decade basically between the ages of sort of like 10 um and about 19 years old where the brain is optimal for specialization during that time and so if you look at the people who were great programmers they usually started programming very early on or a great musicians like age six he composed his first thing it's like wow this is insane and I felt really bad because I was like oh [ __ ] like too late for me right like what am I supposed to do now I was just kind of a normal kid picking boogers in in junior high like I I didn't do that but then I started thinking about it more and I really thinking like was there anything and the one thing I did think of was um a unique experience I had was like I was really into improv early on I Didn't Do It a ton but I did go to like our Texas State kind of finals with like group improv it basically me and my buddy and we group improv which is kind of a podcast without a microphone right like that's what two people doing improv back and forth is and then I was in a couple of movies as a kid and so I kind of was doing this acting improv performing thing I think if there's anything that's what it was but I wasn't a a lemonade stand kind of like eBay flipper type of guy the only other weird one I did was I used to play this game NBA 2K which is common but the uncommon thing was I never played the game so I didn't go in and I wasn't like dunking and shooting and like all I did is I played franchise mode and I would simulate I was basically only a general manager so I would Sim I would simulate the season then I would do the draft I would Scout all the prospects you wouldn't actually play like the like the buttons it wasn't intentional like I thought okay first I'm going to build this great team and so I was just like a CEO basically I was like free agency and trades and scouting and finding diamonds in the rough but I got so addicted to that I never ended up playing with any of those players I would just simulate I would just do that for like a fantasy league 10 years in there I was basically a fantasy GM which I guess is kind of like that's kind of what being a like a CEO or a business person is like you're just doing that part not actually doing the work so but my honest answer was like I was not like Elite at any of those things whereas I think the people who really Excel they tend to show that Brilliance early on and become like oddly good at something their obsession takes over them I don't think I personally had that I love it do you want me to give you the rest of the checklist with the high agency people and you can see who in your life you know yeah weird teenage Hobbies what else you got energy Distortion field so if you meet with them when you're tied and defeated you leave the r ready to run a marathon on a treadmill with Max incline and low agency people do the opposite so this is the kind of idea of treadmill friends afterwards you've got so much energy you need to go on a treadmill you can't sleep then you have like sofa friends who you need to lie down after hanging out with them who's like the treadmill friends in your guys life that comes to mind uh Sam's like that for me my buddy suly is like that like I can't I can't hang out with suly and literally our hangout tends to be we walk for like four hours talking uh because we almost have to burn off the energy that's like the the excitement of the ideas and the stories that we're sharing while we're doing it um that's how this podcast got created it was on a 4H hour walk with him and I was like you know what I really want I was like hour three I was like you know what I really want to do it's not a company I want to create a podcast I want to be Tim Ferris I want to wake up and have a be in a million people's earballs and that was like a thing that came to me when I worked myself into that State uh Ben is kind of like that my business partner Ben where he's yeah like I could just I probably do call Ben I think eight times a day on average you know so we just talk eight times in a day which now that I say it sounds very weird but it feels very normal if I didn't have kids it'd probably be 20 times a day who who are yours George Who are yours uh probably three uh Chris Williamson from Modern wisdom we we like just out all night we can just go and go and go and you guys are both similar like where Chris is like an in know in a good way he's like an academic where like he just like learns and then just teaches and I like you know I feel that way listening to his podcast so who's the second one David senra from Founders like he's just [ __ ] if espresso was a human being it'd be DED [ __ ] senr so that guy I'd add on that and then the third one my old boss um Steve bartler who who runs the D of CEO podcast I remember when Steve was R in the business he'd have an office in Manchester London New York and I'd work in the Manchester office and Steve was maybe there a quarter of the time in that office and what business is this is this this this was back at his marketing agency social check yeah okay and I would open the door and I'd know if Steve was in that day without seeing him just off the energy in the room of everybody else's Vibe so those those three would be my three that's a great compliment how'd you get the job by the way why why did you join social chain he had a unique angle that essentially the UK you mentioned earlier the UK is the sixth largest economy in the world it's not London's the sixth largest economy in the world and then there's a very very poor list of cities and towns attached to it so he based himself in Manchester and just marketed himself well and just sucked up all the talent that was in Manchester which is which is where I was do you want the next one yeah keep going you can never guess their opinions soever it's the boxer that writes poetry Advertiser obsessed with the history of War The Beauty Queen who reads nature if their beliefs don't line up with their stereotypes they've exercised agency so when you give them an opinion on ABC do they fit in a box or do they often surprise you that they fought things through right anybody who pop up what you're saying is basically they're non- cliche so like we just had Jack Smith on the podcast I think Jack is one of these type of independent thinkers where he's like a successful smart Tech guy you know almost like has like a more of an engineer's brain but then he came on and was talking about this like woo woo Energy System healing healing through energy using colors in a in a room that he sat in and how it cured his like whatever I'm like Jack you're too smart for this and I never know how he's going to reply to certain stuff right like I'll explain something to him and I'm like I think you're going to be too smart to believe this but you're open to learning more that's that's wild to me or even what he's going to do his next move right Silicon Valley you sell your company there's two paths you're I think they they take you to a room and they're like hey here's two boxes would you like to become a VC the vest the vest is under this box or you're a founder and you're now your next thing is going to be AI health care or whatever like it's like cliche whereas Jack after he sold his company he's like spent a year in his garage building like the most ergonomic chair he could think of it's like you you you couldn't guess what the guy's goingon to do next he was total non- cliche in that sense I like it the next uh one uh immigrant mentality if they move from their Hometown that's a good sign if they' move from their home country that's an even greater sign because it takes agency to spot you in the wrong place resourcefulness to operationalize a move and a growth mindset to start from zero in a new location dude that's a great Point that's a great point and I've moved around to like nine different countries so I think I I win and that's kind of like what you're saying about America about uh you know sometimes we we started out as a as a country of immigrants and that's maybe one of the reasons why we kind of have uh coverage a little bit yeah yeah what's what's the kether boy it's like the the the people you hire are the company you build it's the same thing for countries it's like if the initial seed population was a bunch of crazy Risk Takers who were willing to get on a boat and go to a new land to like establish it from scratch you're going to create a population of you know people who have that that same mentality the way I've thought about America the way I've narrowed it down is if you look at what makes human being special if you have one human being in a jungle it's the one of the worst animals ever and we're just going to get destroyed if you put 500 of us we you just introduced a master Predator that the world that Forest that jungle has never seen before CU we can cooperate and America is that on steroids because when you go there the enthusiasm the energy the agency sometimes the IQ isn't there I probably argue as Brits might be slightly smar no offense however you've got those things it means you could have an idea it's like yeah great idea let's do it just the bias to optimism the bias to action whereas you have the Brit who uh I don't think that'll work because of ABC that's why America's the best because you can cooperate faster than any country in my opinion the the Doritos loow Co Taco did not come from pessimism right that that's only that is a uniquely American idea you would never that idea could not have been born in any other country I love it last two last two uh they send you Niche content so low agency people look at the social engagement of content before deeming its quality High agency people just look at the content they spot upcoming Trends very early and the final one mean to your face but nice behind your back so the social incentives are to be nice to people's faces and gossip behind their backs whereas the higher people they do the opposite where'd you get that one from one of my friends Lewis who's just I know he'll just say the the honest thing to my face all the [ __ ] time and it's so useful to have a friend like that um whereas the low agency like you basically whenever someone's going against incentives oh the agency that requires to go against incentives I've written this I often don't go against incentives and even though I know incentives I know agency I still fall for it it's the Daniel canman thing at the start of the conversation so to go against the social incentives of pain I'll say rude thing to your face that you need social pain and also when you're not there there's no benefit actually all the benefit is to gossip behind your back to do the opposite and swim upstream you need agency you're very philosophical which I think is cool and it's almost like you have a business just to justify the re just to pay just to give you the excuse to spend time reading and thinking all you're like your own Patron basically you're like cool can I fund myself to sit in a room and and think of ideas and then invert them and then think about them again and then you know write them down and share them with the world like do you do you even like capitalism I well I love compressing ideas so which is why then I like advertising because I can use that skill that I have to compress things down I always love Dar SW shiga's biography where he made all his money for Real Estate so he could do whatever the [ __ ] he wanted with his acting career and I think is slightly underrated doing that Sam did you know I offered to invest in George's business and I was like I'll invest Fair terms I'll blow this thing up we grow this baby like crazy and he was like um that's all good but there's one problem if this grows I'm gonna have to like it's going to suck me more towards that and I actually want to be all in the business of ideas I don't want this to become you know bigger and more which made you so much more that made me respect him so much more right I was like again it's that's a high agency thing to do right to be able can you say no to money like can you say no to money might be like another thing to just add on your list how many times have you said no to money J I've told the story on the podcast before but you may not have heard it the highest agency moment of my life was I was in sixth grade I think I got put in detention after school and our detention was you go to the lunchroom school's out everybody leaves it's just the 20 kids who got in trouble that day you have to sit in silence and do nothing and they they see you kind of like every other chair diagonal so that you can't really you could talk to somebody but you it's not very easy to you can't whisper you have to be a little bit loud and it's me and it's the weirdest kid in our school this a kid who had hair down to his waist and he always wore these like weird tattered shirts and he was just a weirdo and I saw and people used to pick on him and so I'm sitting there and I'm kind of a bully and I wanted to pick on him a little bit and I just wanted to mess with him I was bored right I'm in dehle you have two hours to do nothing and I see on the floor of the lunchroom there's like a grape that was like from lunch hours or earlier and it's like nasty it's on the floor of a kid's lunchroom and it's like got hair on or whatever and I just whispered to him and I was just like yo I give you a dollar if you eat that grape and he looks down he's like a dollar I yeah and then he reaches down and I'm like oh my God he's fell for he's going for it this is insane he picks it up and he eats the grape and I'm like grossed out my mind is blown I can't believe you did it I'm like all right Deal's a deal I get get out my wallet I take a dollar I hand it to him and then he took the dollar and he ate itow I could not believe it damn this was like 22 years ago or something I I still remember it vividly and I just thought that was the biggest no [ __ ] given moment I have ever probably still to this day in my life of like you know f you f your money F the grape I am going to like he just ate the dollar I couldn't believe it no upside in it but he sent an absolute message to my core I love it that's ridiculous um where do you want to go from here Sean uh you got a couple other cool like lifestyle things you do so do you want to talk about the kale phone because I think this is like some something that might be helpful for people what is the kale phone method that you do yeah so again talking about sticky ideas so let me pull them up so I've got them here actually I have my cocaine phone and I have my kale phone so I ended up in I wrote about this and then it ended up on Fox News where it was like Trump Biden and then George ma cocaine kale phone and essentially what I realized is there's two things that are presented to you in modern society as people get more and more addicted to their phones there's one be a phone monkey and just be on your phone all day and deal with the cortisol and all the stress and mental fatigue that everyone's facing is option one option two is just give up on the phone pull it away for a week have the digital detox and benefits of that are yeah you feel mentally clear you feel incredible you're coming up with creative ideas but if your M goes to hospital how she going to get a hold of you or if you're out and about and you need an Uber like [ __ ] I can't get an Uber or if I want to use apple nodes to write down ideas I can't do that so I realized that that what Society presented was either the smartphone addict or the phoneless Lite and actually the somewhere in between which is the cocaine and kale phone so the kale phone is like all serotonin apps that make you feel good so audible notes Uber Google Maps stuff that you need for Necessities as well maybe an emergency number for your mom wife business partner if they need to get a hold of you so you have that peace of mind when you're not on your cocaine phone that they can still get a hold of me worst case scenario if somebody dies then cocaine phone everything slack WhatsApp Tik Tok Facebook Instagram Let's Go Crazy put the cocaine phone in the drawer check it when you need to check it then use the kale phone when you're rapping about for a walk single best thing I've probably done for like my mental health and everybody who tries it or a lot of people who try it writ to me and go this is a game changer what is the actual other phone is it a just like Android phone what did you do for the other phone is it just two iPhones just another Ione but do you have two SIM cards how do you do the number yeah I have two SIM cards so I have a different number in the kale phone than the cocaine foot I got it okay only drawback is that they basically have to have a second phone line and people have to know to to reach you there when you need it but it's only your mom wife maybe that's the only people who really need that but it's just for the peace of mind and most of the time they would and the the only time they're G to do is when someone's at hospital but it's having that peace of mind that therefore I don't need to check the cocaine phone for that incident Sean let me ask you a question be honest about this and I'll answer it and I'll be honest too are do your parents still pay for your cell phone bill I pay them back all right my dad tells me the amount it's a family plan we've been on it for a long time I dude can I change it with keeping my number that's too much work same I am also on my family plan and so George when you're talking about getting a new cell phone shout out to everybody who's on their family plan right now shout out to everybody who dad is paying their phone bill it's all we have that's our last connection that's the last cord that gets cut between you and your parents is the the phone plan I don't even know how to like I've never gotten like a like a like I've always had to call my mother like hey my phone broke I'm going to go buy one will you tell AT&T they got to put it on the plan so when you sold the hostle she didn't go go get your own [ __ ] phone plat she carried on going it's not a money thing fair play well there we go it's not fair play I don't know I I don't think you're using that word like I think it should be used uh espe yeah he text your mom saying I need to get a cocaine phone it's probably not going to go down too well as well I I thought Sean I thought you would have also have been on yours yeah for sure dude it my wife feels it's like almost like a sign of disrespect that I didn't create like a new family plan with us as the CORE family unit and I'm like look it's just a it's just a hassle okay I'm not don't read more into it than what it is do you know just lazy okay there's this episode on uh on like ell degenerous where she's asking Bill Gates like let's see if you know how much a gallon of milk cost like because you know you're so out of touch and so when you talk to me about a cell phone plan I'm like I don't know five bucks 100 bucks that's like $23 right same with the phone plate I'm like I don't know thousand uh uh I don't know I have no idea so George are there any drawbacks or like in practice let's say I wanted to go do this because the idea is really sticky it's really viral even if you never did it it's just like sounds cool but you actually just let me verify you actually live this way yeah before you answer I gotta run I gotta run I'll leave my I'll leave all my stuff up I had a a 130 I'll see you soon see so you actually live this way you actually have the two phones yeah I've done it for three and a bit years and whenever I doubt it so I've had incidents where I've lost one phone or had an issue with signal in a certain country and when you go back to that lifestyle of waking up and downloading social media as your first input into your brain or messaging apps you you real you only realize it via contrast of how destructive I think that is for the CATE particularly for people who are creative people or ideas people like downloading whatever the worst loose headline is immediately into your Consciousness and particularly if you then use your phone as your alarm clock as well it's and it's I've experienced it by contrast it's so toxic I can't deal with it I want to ask you about lean Yu somebody who's been on my list of people I want to go deep dive into sounds like you've read a bit about him or studied him a little bit what is the learnings from leanu so Leu was the leader of Singapore during his reign he went he took Singapore from essentially being a third world country with a lot of problems and you got China and Japan on your doorstep which historically not the friendliest uh people to have on your doorstep and obviously part of the British rule part of the British Empire when from there to one of the best financial hubs in the world but he ran the country like a CEO and one of my favorite anecdotes about Le on youu is how they used to obsess about the airport onboarding experience and it's interesting you see you see such obvious ideas in startups and you go why don't countries just take this the onboarding experience or the conversion rate optimization of a landing page or a website or an advert versus the when you arrive at the airport what's the airport like what are the cues like the immigration cues like what are the bathrooms like how clean are things what's the first few miles from the airport to the city Leon U used to obsess over every everything would be changing the roots would be cleaning things up would be inspecting regularly seeing how quick things were because he knew that that is talented people coming for the first time and dbai does this incredibly well you go there for the first time and you go oh wow they've looked at everybody else's onboarding experience and 5x this immediately having those magic moments like designing Facebook or designing assana within the first few minutes of entering and leaving the airport because it's the F you're going to think it's like a standup comedian the first thing is you D and the last thingers you leave so he used to obsess over that and I remember I went to Austin Airport and as you go up to get an Uber you got to go through like three different car parks and your phone signal goes out and you're sweating I remember thinking to myself I you're treated like a criminal if you try to get an Uber in an American airport you're treated like a criminal it's like oh if you're going to do a drug deal then go to the third parking garage fourth floor behind the fence that's where you can go get picked up if you're going to be an [ __ ] yeah I remember I remember like being there go leak on you would [ __ ] hate this and I remember going that's a weird I go no about that Thor walking through atin airport so lein you was rolling over in his grave right now so so that's interesting because I remember when I was in my teens I went to the Singapore we we went to Singapore and this if you haven't been the Singaporean airport is like a mall it's like an experience like they have like a fitness facility they have like a movie theater there's like it is just a beautiful place everything is clean there's tons of comfortable seating it is not like a pain the way that most airport experiences are and I remember just noting that and be like a that's weird why is Singapore's airport so good so it's very interesting that he thought about it as a first impression onboarding experience now like is that just a cool store did that pay off in some way like did the immigration rate go up or like what what changed from that or what are the things that he did to actually like you know turn the country around you know what were the big levers that he pulled so onboarding is one what what really worked attracting talented immigration is the single biggest the single biggest thing from my understanding of single po story that they did and part of that obviously is the onboarding and if you look at it Singapore has essentially no natural resources so it's not blessed with Saudi Arabia's oil or like LA's Beauty necessarily but just attracting as many talented immigrants the specifics around the economics as well I I don't know as much on but around Taxation and things like that but it's just a wild case study I know Charlie wer is obsessed with Leu he has the story of Leon we were talking about mating earlier Leon Yu rather than marrying the hottest girl of his class picked the only girl in his class that performed better than him and he was at the most like Elite University at Singapore he married the lady who's the only one who was smarter than him so very odd peculiar individual um there's another thing he did was around air conditioning right didn't he do like an a a big push for AC having AC in the country yeah I saw that recently I think it was was it Peter levels on Twitter that was breaking that down yeah he was obsessed with getting air conditioning because he was convinced it was key to the economic success yeah like he was basic so there was a interview with him I'm reading an article now from Vox so basic interview with him and said was there anything else besides Multicultural tolerance that enabled Singapore success and his answer was air conditioning air conditioning was a most important invention for us and basically I think that if you look at countries like you know my parents they grew up in India and India is so hot that during the day during like your brain's most kind of productive hours they take like a three-hour period where you just stay inside you just try to sleep and you're even even you can't even try to sleep because it's like so hot so you're just like laying in a cot with like you know fan trying to cool down because you can't be outside you can't really be productive in thinking right now you just have to wait out the heat you know my assistant is in the Philippines and one of the things that she always talks about is like they would have these heat waves and it's like super hard for her to work because she flipped her schedule she works in the evening her time which is daytime my time and I was like man is that really inconvenient for you like how how does that work for your lifestyle by she's like well you know of course it takes some adjusting but one of the big things is I don't have to deal with the heat because I sleep during the day when it's really hot and I wake up at the in the evening when it's cooler and that's when I work and I I feel better that way it's also by the way why so many great Engineers come from like the Nordic regions because those are places where it's like too cold to go outside too dark to go it's like dark all the time and so they just stay inside they program and they just code on computers because there's not really better options out there and they develop this like amazing engineering talent because during their formative years they just stay inside a bunch of time and what's the best thing to do when you're inside is like play on the computer play video games and um you know know learn to learn to program just second and third order the consequences everywhere you look it's crazy yeah ex exactly exactly do you have any other of the like kind of key Frameworks that really I don't know shifted the way you think or you keep seeing pop up that you don't think most people appreciate I'd say there's two one is probably mine and yours favorite meme sh of the the midw meme which just refuses to die it just it's like a fine wine it gets better with age and realizing how often I've been the guy in the middle over the years and then trying to come out of solutions to not be the guy in the middle and then realizing do you have any uh canonical examples of the mid whip meme of you in the middle um that you could think of like just personal attacks on your psyche yes um one was when I started to get really obsessed with sleep when was like 20 21 and I'd have everything sleep optimized my Walker had just been on Joe Rogan so I've got the 10-step checklist routine I've got the supplements I've got everything and I'm there doing the whole like 2our wind down routine those screens before bed red light glasses on I'm brushing my teeth in the dark and my girlfriend of a time comes in and like hits the lights like minutes before bed like blinds me so I'm completely blinded I like getting out I like the first R we ever had was that I like what are you doing and I was sat there in bed so she's a of course the like on the left or on the right she's immediately fallen asleep within two minutes without doing any of the [ __ ] I was doing I'm Stu there for an hour afterwards like shaking with adrenaline of like how angry SL blitzed I was and I realized oh [ __ ] a lot of sleep for example it had a phase of insomnia and a lot of sleep is the more you think about sleep the more pressure you put on sleep the worse the sleep is which is why a lot of these if I was if I was the CMO of whoop or Aura the one thing I would suggest them to do like coming in as a product thing would be to never allow you to know the next day's score because this I this this is actually probably one of the most toxic things I think we'll see for Sleep of people checking their sleep as well as going to sleep thinking about what score they're going to get is the opposite of what you want that's literally create an insomniac cycle versus a week later having a summary of the previous week when you're detached from the results probably useful but the next day is particularly bad so that's a Midway area that's a great one I think one of the studies about what makes people unhappy or depressed or suicidal like one of the strongest signals is this idea of rumination which is like almost like a obsessive thought Loop about yourself and your thoughts and so once you get in that thought Loop it is very very difficult to get out it's also why one of the easiest hacks to feeling better about yourself is to simply just go help other people like it is the over o over focus on yourself and your own condition is what creates your own poor conditions and um you know the it's the same reason my trainer says this thing he goes um whatever you feel you lack that's exactly what you got to give you feel you lack respect you got disrespected go give respect you feel like you lack money go give money and and and literally just flipping the mindset of like I lack to like I have enough that I can give breaks this thought Loop of like worry and anxiety around certain topics and sleep is the same way health is the same same way where you could literally be become like manic about your own health and you're stressing yourself out which decreases your health and I think a lot of people fall into this trap with therapy and with self-improvement where they get addicted to the medicine and it creates um too much thoughts about yourself you know the happiest people are the ones who are you know that are not doing this like extreme introspection all the time yes the single the S cuz I noticed that when it came to decisions let's say people probably got this right now like big decision do I move to the city or stay to the city do I quit this thing or carry on doing this thing I would have thing in my head where it would play the if I thought about just moving to the city it would play the worst case scenario of that in my head like the amigdala would fire and then I think about the other thing and the amigdala would fire and play the worst case scenario and as a result paralysis analysis just kick the cat and make the decision to not make the decision and one of the biggest B of advice I got was stop thinking about making decisions and start thinking about making experiments because I realized there was decisions I was procrastinating on for two years I could have done both of them 10 times over in the time spent thinking about the thing yeah that's that's a great one Sam has a nice little one on this called worry time which is once he think something is worthy of an experiment or worthy of trying right there a big difference between your your your words there right experimenting with something I'm gonna try this out very different than I'm gonna do this I have to do this this is my new my new thing I I choose this so giving himself a little bit of Grace there by saying I'm gonna try to experiment but he says he schedules his worry time so he says cool what I don't want to do is make this decision and then reassess it daily and worry about it every single day worry about is it working is it going to work am I good enough is this is this right is this wrong I'm making a mistake here he's like so I schedule it I'll put it on Sunday I'll literally pull it on the calendar I'll put 30 minutes that's my worry time and so I know I'm GNA worry about this on Sunday I don't need to worry about it today for now I just need to do it I have my scheduled worry time because I think when you don't decide when you're going to worry about it you worry about it all the time cuz you're almost worried that you're never that you're never going to assess it and I found that to be a great hack is to to schedule the worry time Mike trainer says it's like when you plant a seed to grow a plant the next day if you come and dig it up and you go look at it are you growing yet is it working you're actually destroying the the seed's ability to actually grow like plant the seed and don't just dig it up every day and stare at it and wonder why it's not working Carry On Water it give it sunlight that's all you really need to do from there 100% one guy who's completely changed my thinking and you should have him on the show like absolute ma of a Founder that goes under the radar you know element the electrolyte company oh elementy like the so like C like they in five years they're growing like banana numbers like hundreds of millions met James the founder talk about high agency we were camping and there was Bears nearby and I'm terrified of bears as as you wouldn't be as a [ __ ] human being but James is there if James is there like he'll handle it it's fine like he'll deal with it and his way like they managed to scale the way they have and he's wrote about this publicly that he does three week on one week off three week on one week off so you know the whole one of your aphorisms or Nal aphorisms of Sprint like a like a lion don't Grace like a cow and I realized with his philosophy what he's doing there is he has that one week assessment period to because I noticed that when I went in the holiday the first three days I would be um it would take me to the fourth day to switch off and I think he's Bigg than his schedule first three days have fun then the following three days he's assessing the okrs reviewing the numbers looking at the experim plotting out the next three weeks and then that following three weeks is just a hardcore Sprint and he's completely redone the work and it makes sense we just downloaded this work we Philosophy from Industrial Age versus really thinking about it and he's managed to do that for himself and his whole leadership team whilst the company's growing like bananas and it's factoring in that worry time um it makes so much more sense I love that uh yeah I think that's great actually makes me think you know Monday through Friday you know 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. why right even though I'm My Own Boss I'm in my own house and my schedule is a little bit different IO I I believe I suspect that it is not as different as it should be to what actually would be the most beneficial to me in my life to both my creativity but also my enjoyment of my life uh because I probably just I started with the the normal you know 52 weeks in a year you're going to work Monday through Friday you're going to take your weekends off and then you're GNA have two weeks three weeks of vacation somewhere in the between and then I just tweaked that versus first principles like okay what if I didn't even know that what would I have designed how would I be working and I bet there's probably even more I can do on that front which obviously is you know a bit of a luxury to have but it's also an intentional thing like some people's goal was to have fancy cars and and you know go to go to festivals and all this stuff that wasn't my dream my dream was total control of my time have a lifestyle that I truly enjoy that is like you know super fun so that's that's the luxury I want to keep funding uh you know is is that and the realization I had from his schedule of that three one is the rewards of working like a lion have never been higher like with leverage and code and internet businesses the ease of grazing like a cow has never been easier goes back to the cocaine kale Pham like so much [ __ ] going on like there's always the busy trap you can end up in and you've got this weird period of time right now where the rewards of this have never been higher but the actual Act of doing it has never been harder and his philosophy of three week on one week off I would encourage everybody to just search elent 3 to one he wrote an essay on it you should have him on the show he's phenomenal and the fact they've done it whilst also growing as aggressively as they have for the whole leadership team and they all take a week out to be creative and come up with new ideas when they come back is uh phenomenal yeah that's pretty awesome by the way the thing you just said about the the lion versus the cow so the people haven't heard it the the phrase is is you know you want to work like a lion not a cow the way a lion works is they they first just wait and they look for prey right they're just observing they're looking for an opportunity they're not just going to run around randomly or chase like small insects they look for a worthy a worthy challenge a worthy prey And when they see the gazelle then they Sprint as hard as they can they don't walk they take Massive Action they move with speed they catch it they Feast they celebrate and then they rest and reassess and wait for the next challenge whereas a cow stands in the field slowly walking around all day grazing on this low nutritional you know density grass all day of course they're animals that's how they that's what they need to eat that's fine but in terms of uh working a lot of us work more like the cow we sit at our desk eight hours a day minimal you know kind of like some low simmer of productivity and then we don't have the juice to Sprint nor do we feel confident and secure enough to rest reassess to celebrate we just sort of feel this anxiety to be constantly you know sort of on and sort of on is a problem you're you're a UFC guy right did you ever see that interview with Conor McGregor after he lost his fight to Nate Diaz um do you remember this era where he was on his rise he's going to fight Nate Diaz and this was probably the first opponent that he was favored against so he supposed to you know he was supposed to get crushed by Aldo he he he um you know and but he beats Aldo he's supposed to get beat by Mendes a wrestler that's his Kryptonite he beats Mendes and then it's snate Diaz oh here's a guy he's lost half his fights won half his fights you know he's not a champion McGregor has proven everybody wrong you're certainly going to beat Diaz and instead he goes and he loses and the one reason he lost was his cardio was really poor he had miscalculated his training and he he ran out of gas and so when he went back to the lab and he's rest and reassess and try to figure out what to do next he said this great line he goes yeah I hired this coach and they go so you're training a lot more now right to have more cardio like you're doing more more more he goes no actually it was about doing less he goes the thing was I was never resting my body the analogy my my trainer gave me was you're like a a light bulb that's always flickering you're just at a DM level and you're never turning off and you're never really bright uh because you're never resting you're always doing stuff you're overtraining and you're never giving your body a chance to to recuperate and so because of that your training is never peing you're never actually shining really bright nor is the switch ever going off so that's what they changed then he came back and he ended up you know winning the winning the next fight just a couple months later and his cardio had had improved in that that most most people thought in that two months you can't really improve your cardio that much but he did and he was able to win that fight I always thought that was a wonderful example of this kind of like 321 sort of philosophy but not in business but in you know Sports yeah have it my friend called it rest ethic it's like Ah that's the sticky idea there it needed to be compressed he talks about his subconscious as he's like technical co-founder so leaving ideas of be subconscious and yeah I think we'll see more and more focus in that area as leverage gets higher and higher and realizing that there's no such thing as overworking there's just under reses thing there's no such thing as overworking that's only under resting what do you do to rest besides sleep I'm trying to think of anything that's non-basic well that's okay if it's basic I'm I'm into simple things that work if it's just I go for walks that's great h i mean honest answer would be kale phone in the morning by so I'm detached from immediate inputs coming through having a bit of intentionality sa so resting is not just napping resting is not having a thousand inputs coming into your brain at all all hours of the day exactly like having time to process things like that Christopher Nola thing of him not having a smartphone I think there's Pro whilst if everybody's addicted to their smartphones right now there's probably a little bit of alpha in not being as addicted to your smartphone yeah I started doing silent Sundays where basically I just on I put the phone in a box on Saturday and I won't touch it all Sunday which is a very small step but when you do it you realize the depth of the addiction because you start to have you know you're padding your your pocket every 3 seconds or your you're going to the bathroom and you're like what am I going to do how am I going to entertain myself in this like six-second walk to the restroom that's literally how extreme it is for me yeah that's crazy it's crazy that we've that that's happening societal wide and we've all it's like caffeine it's what the real drugs are the real addictions are the one that's probably just going completely under the radar because we never want to kick that thing yeah the the real the dangerous addictions are the ones that are socially acceptable yes well Lou Lou CK has a cocaine he has a kale laptop apparently he has one laptop writing laptop that has no internet in it's just a it's just a text it's smart because you're not going to be you're not going to beat the world's best data scientist when it comes to who who've ran all these AB tests meanwhile you've woken up on five hours sleep with a little bit of a Handover and you think you're going to win you're not going to win yeah we'll finish with this what's the what's the how to Source your values this is an idea I've never heard from you what what is that so I called this Buffet coin it may need a stickier idea or a stickier meane behind it but there's this incredible talk I think it's Warren Buffett the University of Georgia it's my favorite idea of his that very few people have discussed it's on YouTube or how' you see it I think I originally saw it on YouTube there's a few writeups as well and he's given a talk and the kids in the class ask him how to be S the cliche how to be successful thing and rather than like listing back or how to I think it's how to be rich essentially and rather than listenting the cliche thing back he says as a thought experiment look around at the people in the class right now and if you could invest in them and get 10% of their earnings for the rest of their life who would it be and why so immediately shine you could probably think of lots of people people at home can probably think of lots of people and you think about it and you go okay yeah I'd definitely invest in Jim or I'd definitely invest in Mike and then he goes and then ask yourself why what is it that that person does the values that they have the behaviors that they have and you can then see we spoke at the first episode about it's so hard to see in yourself but it's so easy to see in other people so you're kind of hacking the self-awareness bias of like you trying to ruminate and improve yourself is probably mid wasted effort but looking at other people you can see immediately and then you can try and get your values that way and then he flips the experiment around and goes if you had to Shore people in your life so you can take 10% of their losses who would you who would you take and why and then you have a list of values to go towards a list of values guy gets what's beautiful about that is it's not just money you can apply that for health coin you can apply that for happiness coin but using that third P third party awareness perspective is so much more useful than ruminating analizing yourself at least I've found I love that it was so simple right it's like the answer the answer becomes incredibly clear as soon as you ask that question you know who if if you take you know wealth or you take happiness and it's who would you bet on you could pretty quickly a couple of names come to mind okay great why why well because there this this and this cool there's your blueprint you didn't need the advice from Warren Buffett like the advice was literally hidden in plain sight in the people that you knew right around you the blueprint was visible they were like a walking blueprint of what to do or what not to do I love that I've tried to use that on the health side because health is probably the one area of my life that I and when I say health I mean not being fat health is like a fancy way of saying it I'm not trying to do fancy health I'm tried to be like hey I'm pretty fat I should just be not fat uh and I should be fit instead of fat and so what I realized was I was like oh all I simply need to do is just do the things that the fit people do so instead of searching for like which diet is best or which workout program should I be doing or what equipment should I it's like let's just simplify who in my life is fit and then simply what do they do and find the Delta between what I do and what they do oh okay at night when I'm hungry I go grab a bag of chips from the pantry at night when they're hungry they drink a glass of water and they go to sleep right or in the morning you know the first thing I do is I roll over I check my phone my laptop I start working what they do is they go work out first for 45 minutes and then they start working okay good I like the blueprint is stupidly obvious it's right in front of me you know for example my trainer came with me on a trip and so we all packed our bag and when we all got there we all look in the bag and he had a protein powder in there he had a set of bands in there and he had a little Mya fascia like ball like a massage ball so that when he got off the flight he could quickly loosen up and it's just we looked at all of our bags you know business guys who were out of shape we just didn't even have the [ __ ] in the bag and it's not the tool it's just simply like it's not like he had to think ah how am I gonna be fit this weekend it's simply a way of life for him and so the the easiest question I have is what's is that I ask myself when I'm like in a situation is all right sweet what's a fit guy like me doing in a situation like this instead of what should I do what am I going to do do what should I order off door dashes what's a fit guy like me order at a time like this and the answer is a lot easier when I simply think of what what does a person who already has the outcome I want how do they approach the same situation and luckily there's enough people around my around me in my life where I can just watch and see what they do and I think the key asteris the key asteris I think he gives as well is it has to be Merit based so like you can't just pick the person with the billionaire dad or the ridiculous AB genetic Francis and ganu style the better the returns if you almost look at like a company like the better Returns on their start position that you would bet on is probably the person who studied the most like it it's the super skidy guy that you go I'd still bet on his Fitness coin or if it's this the guy from the worst background but you'd still bet on his Finance coin those are the real values you can learn from I love it dude George as I knew this was amazing two parts uh so good so fun to talk to you dude this is why when I launched my new Good Friday the email series that I started doing on my website you were the first guy I reached out to because I love trading ideas with you and

by the way you know how I know this is a great episode cuz I feel like I need to get off this and go do these ideas right now like I don't even want to finish this episode I want to go do one of these things right now that's how I know this is a [Music] banger have you guys ever heard this idea that the Australian accent is just drunk English accent because like Australia was populated by all like the criminal of the drunkards from England and that the the accent in Australia is just a drunk London guy so far off there's a great Paul Graham blog post that that I don't know if you guys read called cities I think it's called cities and ambition and he has this concept in it he says that every city Whispers something to you every every city is Whispering something so he's like you know maybe it's in LA right you're the whisper that's that's there for you is you know become somebody right become like sort of known become a Power Player a a famous person basically you're not famous enough and in Silicon Valley he says the whisper is you're not ambitious enough because the status symbol here is not who's the most beautiful or the most famous or even the most rich to be honest the status symbol is like who's doing the big mission here right who's like the AI guys now they're the highest status even if you have a a really amaz if you're the CEO of workday and you're like dude I got a80 billion company over here your low status compared compared to the you know the guy who's trying to make you know the next version of an llm and so he says New York Whisperers something he basically like you should think about which cities you want to live in because that's what's going to get whispered to you all the time uh I don't know what it would be for Austin I'm curious you guys Sam you've lived there what's the Austin whisper the Austin whisper is how do you live a Fit Life on your own terms which means like being very balanced so Austin is very much a balance so how do you work six hours AEK week go for walks be with your family wake up early be healthy Austin is a place of balance I think George what's the what's the Dubai whisper right now is it like uh like you're poor like and there's definitely a little bit of that like I never thought I would have ended up being in Dubai for a little bit of time but it was during covid and the second lockdown came along and I wanted to go to the mountains by myself and Chris my friend from Modern wisdom said come to Dubai and I was like I grew up reading Like Richard Dawkins Sam Harris Christoph Hitchens I'm scared of going to like an Islamic country and Chris gave me the ultimate reply of don't be a virgin K and I went for two weeks stayed for three years but it's a very unique weird bizarre fascinating place that's great all right let's jump in so you have you knew that we love business ideas and I'll give you two things you wrote an intro for yourself I'm going to read it but I think you didn't do yourself justice so you said you know I'm I'm excited to come on you said I don't have crazy high stakes huge exits of my business I'm more of a mum's basement writing ideas online coming up with weird ideas and essays kind of guy um so you know I have some ideas some business ideas and opportunities uh but I have a lot of philosophies and Frameworks I think that's great you also didn't do yourself full Justice you have a great marketing agency so you have a successful business there also you're not just a kid in a basement writing essays you're a kid in a basement writing essays that get read by everybody from uh you know Jo to Elon Musk Elon elon's been retweeting you a lot lately and I think that's a a good sign bro you you've made it I appreciate that you you're uh killing the British syndrome out of me so I do appreciate that what happens when Elon retweets you by the way do you get like a lot of traffic uh yeah I get quite a lot of traffic I mean the one thing I did notice of I've reached like hundreds of millions of people on Twitter and I've never had one dm from a girl and then Chris Williamson started sharing my videos on Instagram and it changed a little bit like it's all men Tech things on Twitter like that but yeah you do get quite a lot of traffic the notifications Bell does start to break a little bit all right so let's start with business ideas what uh what have you got for us so what are the opportunities ideas little half-baked um startups that that you're in your mind right now yeah so as Sean kind of mentioned I run the ad Professor account so people might know that on Twitter as well we make some of the best ads online um I'm obsessed with from an advertising angle and all my business ideas think of like the advert first and then I kind of work from that so the first business idea that I think would be pretty cool that I've always wanted to do but I've never got around to is essentially I know you guys love personality tests um like the personality test business model that exists it's quite an easy find out about yourself everybody's fascinated by it even if a lot of it is pseudo science and I'll never forget the day I'm in the car with my Mom hope she don't mind me me telling the story I'm in the car with my mom my dad's there my brothers are there my mom's heavily dyslexic so she doesn't want to do the personality test but she wants me to read it for her and then she's answering so I'm reading out the question of I don't like to get into arguments and she'll be like oh I heavily disagree and then me and my dad are like no heavily agree so quickly realized that personality tests are often answers that you want to be true about yourself versus the actual reality and this kind of idea of a self-awareness test where the personality test you potentially fill out but everybody in your close Circle so in your wife your parents your business partner fills out and you have a node there reason why I like this idea is it's a little bit of a lot ofala you've got one stacking on personality tests that have always worked the two the social graph effect and then three the advert angle of being able to run adverts directly on find out what your wife thinks about you the question I would have is is it a business you like it this is a great idea I I've been talking about tests like this I I have like a notebook of like what's the new IQ test the five Lang five love languages test and I've been really fascinated could you run a Facebook ad funnel to uh to one of these businesses because I think most of the people who do this they do like a bookfunnel which is like the slowest old way of doing things they write a great book about theci The Love Languages thing and then in it like strength finders they write a book and then in it they give you like a a code or whatever to to go take the test and you go pay for the test um but I love this for the reason you just described the viral Factor um can I tell you a story of why I think this might work so when um when I first moved to Silicon Valley I worked for this guy Michael bir and he had built a social network called bio that he sold for $850 million but before he built bio he buil he built a social network called Ringo that was the same exact thing as bibo but just like 12 months earlier um that he sold for like two or three million and what he did was he built Ringo it started to grow he didn't know he couldn't keep up with the server cost he didn't know how like at the time there was no Facebook like he didn't know how social networks were ever going to make money so he was at a Meetup and a guy offered him like 4 million bucks for it and he's like done um then he worked for that guy and they had a quiz company called tickle and tickle was basically like it started out more on the Myers Briggs like intellectual tests became everything then it became what breed of dog are you and turns out what breed of dog are you was way more viral than like what is your life passion supposed to be right this like harder more introspective test people wanted the what dog are you and so what dog are you went really viral they sold tickle for $100 million to monster so he was like holy [ __ ] quizzes are this amazing viral thing because people want like you said their favorite subject is themselves then they're curious to know the answer where where do I land um and then when they're done they post or they share where they landed and other people say oh that's what you are I wonder what I am and they go take it as well so the only difference he made between Ringo the thing that was you know growing kind of fast and you know sold for 4 million and bibo which grew really fast a million users in nine days the first nine days only change he made was that when he launched bio it was a copy paste of Ringo but with one difference instead of filling out a profile you just started off with a personality quiz which was the be I think it was called the best friend test it was how well do you know me so you would answer questions about yourself and then other people would try to and you would say you would send it to your friends be like see how well you know me and then it would show you who knows you the best and you would kind of compete and when after they would feel yours out like I'm guessing how well I know you then I would fill my own out and I would send it back to you and so it went super viral off this one mechanism and so the thing you described I think would work really well because it is a how well do you know me but your your version was how well do I know myself but I think the real question there actually is what do other people think about me which is probably the biggest question that I have is what do other people think about me and can I kind of anonymously find that information out all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show so Sean do you remember um like six episodes ago you were talking about going to Victoria and how someone said they did this like Jack SK yeah they did this like Executive coaching thing where you do a quiz and it tells you about yourself so I loved that and turns out with Hampton we have access to thousands of Executives and so we were thinking about should we integrate this and so um we're currently testing it actually with like idea three or four customers where what we've done is we've created a quiz like you've described George where it talks about like uh whatever you're asking your mother like these questions of like what's your opinion of of yourself for these questions and then you actually send it to 20 different um co-workers wife husband whatever and then you get the results and we have put together this presentation to help you improve and maybe it's a product that we could charge thousands of dollars for but George do you know about this like the the thing we're talking about have you ever heard about this no so this guy basically does this for executives and it's like a 360 like basically brutal honesty punch in the face so that's the idea is like he charges I think like 30 grand for this you pay $30,000 to take this test and what they do is they go interview it's not just a quiz they go and actually like sit down talk interview your wife your business partner your people who manage you people who you manage all this stuff and they then come back to you with like here's like the truth here's where you're amazing here's maybe where you rub people the wrong way and here's you know something that's you know whatever they give you that that feedback I don't know how great it is but the two people I know who have done it were both like yeah this was massive for me now they were both also in that phase where they sold their company for hundreds of millions of dollars and needed a little bit of direction and purpose and wanting to indulge it's a luxury item they were a thirsty person asking for water yeah exactly but hey Hampton is a group of thirsty people asking for water so Sam I my prediction is I think you will either double or triple the like lifetime value of your customers if you integrate this thing I think that is a genius idea Sam so George you got got any more tips for me to people what I like about this is it rides a few societal memes as well that you've seen the gurus on Instagram chat about self-awareness but what does that actually mean and what show me where that grows cor like what does self-awareness actually meet whereas this it's a quite a bit of a practical way of seizing self awareness and I remember there's a line from Daniel canaman who wrote thinking fast and slow so he's the ultimate cognitive behavioral researcher no Prize winner every cognitive bias you can think of came largely Downstream of Daniel canaman he's The Godfather and his overwhelming lesson was that essentially all that research taught him nothing and the only thing he taught him was it's much easier to see mistakes in other people than to see it in yourself and this is that kind of idea right that other people we don't notice we have bad breath but people other people can realize within seconds we don't realize we're dating the wrong partner till 20 years and horrific divorce but your best friend sees it in two minutes so there is something about when your ego is removed from it and other people see things a lot clearer than youat wasn't his other takeaway was that he was like at the end of his life he was like oh I was I think I was wrong I think a bu of this I think a bunch of This research uh he like did this book and it was amazing and he goes I think we got a lot wrong about that uh is that true is that what happened is that what happened George it was something like that where he like like you know we said these like five theories and like these three I think actually are wrong there's a few he definitely got wrong and there's a few funny ones of where he talks about planning fallacy and even knowing planning fallacy doesn't prevent planning fallacy so even the guys that came up with the idea of planning fallacy when they were putting in research of how do we teach planning fallacy to kids at schools or to in a curriculum they even they underestimated how long it would take for the curriculum or planning fallacy itself so just because you know the cognitive biases doesn't mean you can escape them what is that what's the planning fallacy the planning fallacy is this idea that um if you say I'm going to achieve X within a month it will probably take two months and no matter how long and even being aware of the planning fallacy doesn't prevent it from not happening so you constantly it takes three times as long as you think it will and cost twice as much which is interesting when you read elon's biography I wonder if that's one of the reasons why he just always sets absolutely absurd deadlines because he knows that even with that factored in it's still going to be later than you well that that's what I was going to ask you so is the way to fix that that you make stupidly ambitious goals and then like if it's where you shoot for the stars and if you miss you land on the moon type of vibe I that's what he does I think there's definitely something to that but I I wonder if you can actually [ __ ] yourself to that level I don't know yeah the other I think the other way to do it is you burn the boat so you make it where it has to get done there is no way for it to spill over like it's not physically possible because that's when you the sort of the remarkable things happen right like you know it's when he runs out of money and the last rocket has to take off it can't explode like the like the previous three that's the rocket that actually went because he's actually out of money at that point there is no there is no other way and I think this where there's a lot of remarkable stories of people in sort of like when they're actually backed into a corner and there's no out that's when they're able to perform the miraculous they're able to do what what seemingly couldn't been have been done before you said something interesting I want to go back to real quick you said when I think about businesses I start with the advert which is the ad and you work backwards to the business so what like explain that more cuz I think it's really smart what do what do you mean by that or maybe what's an example of that I've helped so many founders with their advertising and the amount of them will spend years on their idea and then realize there's no distribution for this thing it just isn't distributive native so I always think from the compression algorithm I know we spoke about this Sean of like a sticky idea which is essentially all adverbs like good adverts themselves are a sticky idea which is essentially the following algorithm of total amount of emotion times number of people that can understand it and that is what makes ultimately a good advert and if I can't compress it down because people talk about an elevator pitch it's almost like the ad pitch right can you compress this thing down to person who doesn't give a [ __ ] about you scrolling in their feed um and them immediately going I'm going to give money towards this that two second stap shot and I think if you can't compress that down it needs it needs more work you uh you have an idea on here and the sentence that you're going to reply with when I ask what your second idea is is it's just the most ridiculous sentence that will ever be said on this podcast so what's that one yeah number two number two Sean already knows me quite well so he knows I'm an absolute weirdo sound but obviously first impressions today I'm ruining it for you um I love weirdos you're the great this is exactly what I'm about so sex is going to potentially die as a reproductive mechanism so if we just go through the history of sex so if you could imagine a chart of sex to Baby ratio from like the 1500s so you had the first official condom that came in In 1855 there's talk that it was actually in the 1500s people using animal parts but like the condom we know it the condom as we know it now like a sheep intestine yeah now that's a Drop Shipping Store right there right um and and uh then the morning after pill came in the 1920s and then full effect in like the 1970s so if you can imagine number of times having sex to baby it's going like this with time it's completely plummeting what I think is looking more and more likely with and another we talk about adverb first approach I think you spoke about this before Sean when you look at different Technologies coming in so you've obviously got IVF you've got biobanks with lots of genetic data you've got phenotype tests genotype tests I think you're already seeing this with my friend Jonathan um has a company that they're going to be launching probably around about next year the essentially particularly for wealthy people and I think it'll trickle down Society where you have 10 embryos and they can basically map now okay if you want to avoid diabetes Cron's disease cancer Etc we recommend this embryo selection um and then obviously it's going to probably get weirder or weirder with time whether that's height eye color IQ things like that so we're really on the precipice of this and all you're going to need is a few people with being able to Crunch the the data and it's gonna be a wild couple years so that's actually pretty convincing because Sam's right when I read this you said we're one of the last generations to be created via sex I was like I don't know what the hell he's talking about test two babies and then but when you just made that case I got to admit it went from George's nuts to oh he's right which is basically that like we already have the tech now to basically have a baby to create a baby without having sex cool IVF does that all the time and then when you say well what's the benefit the benefit is selection right so first it's deselection of you know horrible diseases who can argue against that then you have Pro selection which is do you want the blue-eyed smarter taller like what what do you want right the higher likelihood chance right and let's say let's say that science is making that more and more possible over time seems like that's where the puck is going at that point are you going to be the parent who's like nah I'm crap shooting it I'm just rolling the dice I'm just going to go do the animal way we're gonna we're going to In and Out this burger animal style we're just going to go do it and then whatever happens happens whereas all your friends and neighbors are the ones you know handpicking best babies out of test tubes to say we want the embryo that's going to be the healthiest the the the most sort of setup to thrive it seems like you're at a disadvantage if you're going to go choose the old school way right it's driving stick when when the world moves to automatic when when I read the sentence George I was like when George George is going to love the earth when he comes back down to reality like once he once he leaves Mars it comes back you're gonna love Earth it's great we have water yeah but then I realized hey guess what I had my child via ibf so I wasn't gonna say it but Sam you did this exactly what you are describing I did my friend yeah oh there and it it listen we did it because there's a gene that runs in uh in our blood that we didn't want to pass on and we did it we all we mission accomplished we eliminated that Gene we got rid of the Target too sexy Gene dude yeah you got rid of that damn being beautiful is caused too many problems for you yeah we wanted our kids to be 5'8 uh and uh it worked um and so yeah I did the exactly what the thing that you're talking about I'm gonna get get rid of the British self-doubt I I think I guess there's two types of people that hear this there's one type that goes this is really weird why would anybody ever do this and the second type goes oh my god I've been so worried about this family hereditary condition for so so long of course so the first people if you actually hear that and think that you're probably quite lucky that you don't have it but anybody who has like I've got a few different family chronic conditions and as soon as I heard this I was like oh if I could not see my child go through pain that I've seen other family members go through whatever money this takes goes back to Sean's Point work backward from the Facebook ad like are you concerned about ABC diabetes Cron's disease insert condition funnel right there and immediately you can see how you can have very wealthy people paying a lot of money for that and with time the unit of Economics will go down th up and up and it also makes sense because people are waiting like I've got so many friends who are in their 30s late 30s they're wanting to have their first kid uh because like they're yuppies and they focus on career for a long time and then you get in your late 30s and you're like [ __ ] my parts aren't working as they're supposed to like I could use a little help to to like make this happen it's so so common so much more common than I ever thought so yeah funny story so we we were doing the podcast with somebody who's super super wealthy like a billionaire and before we did the Pod I wanted to meet the person so I went to their house hung out with them got to know them a little bit Ben was with me and we so we hung out it was great we had a long conversation about bunch of different subjects business Tech life blah blah blah and somewhere along the way this person was like they've mentioned oh yeah we you know I have this many kids and I'm expecting we're expecting our our next one we're like oh congratulations so anyways we leave and so when we're leaving the house we we you know say bye to everybody you know meet the family say bye afterwards I'm like Ben so what's the what were your big like notes what were your takeaways because what did we learn wow we just got this amazing access to this person none of this was recorded but like we can learn from this what what did we learn and I had like all these like business nuggets like oh he mentioned this growth tactic oh he he said this was the reason why that thing succeeded and Ben goes goes looked at his notes he goes oh I found the ultimate luxury item I was like what like his car or what are you talking about and because he had showed us his garage of cool cars and um he's like no surrogate I was like what he goes when we were walking out we saw his wife and he said like we're expecting a baby next month but his wife is not nine months pregnant fuckingo he's like that has got to be he he's like right that's got to be the ultimate luxury item it's like you don't have to go through like this like incredible body you know experience to to to carry and then birth this baby that's the ultimate luxury and so I started laughing at that and I thought he kind of right I think there is I disagree with you on that you disagree that what that it's a luxury item yeah I think or that everybody wants it no I think I don't want I mean look it's a bunch of dudes talking about [ __ ] that we ain't gonna experience but like I could barely form a sentence I called it a body transformation yeah I got three kids and I still don't really understand what's going on yeah but no I think that's like a necessary thing to go through in order to bond with your with your kid um so I don't that's like saying if you're adopted you're not gonna have a bond or there's I think there's a lot of new on to that uh but George what do you think uh I mean I like these things because I don't tell me your opinion on on what we should do with women's bodies yeah put me on the spot that okay I I'll give you like a different angle to this when I uh so my wife wanted to deliver naturally so no medication no nothing and I was like are you nuts why you do trying to do this the hard way she's like no that's what I want to do so we went to this birthing class giving birth the Natural Way by far the most like scarred into my brain uh you know three hours I've ever been in and one of the things that I rais my hand at one point because it's like 90 minutes in and they're just describing what seems like voluntary torture and I'm like hey I just got to ask like is this what most people do or and she's like no no like I think said 80 something per 85% of people choose an epidural and I was like makes sense to me and epidural is also kind of a new newer technology right like so for you know hundreds of years there was no selfing as epidural but once you had the option to have a baby that W without you know being able to feel all of the pain and the delivery and the labor obviously a lot of people opted into that so there's a whole bunch of like birth businesses that are like you know the epidural is a birth business like after we had our baby they're like do you want to freeze the cord blood and like eat the lenta I was like I don't know what you're talking about but like no to the eating freezing uh what's that for they're like well if your kid ever has a thing and they need a you know stem cells this is like super rich thing of stem cells I'm like cool so how does this work and they go well we're going to take the cord right when the baby's born and this might save your baby's life someday but we're just going to freeze it and you're going to pay us you know couple thousand dollars now and then like $500 a year for now until the end of time and I was like okay yes but also how do I go buy one of these businesses because the most incredible business I've ever heard of you you're playing on parents fear at a time when all of their love endorphins are kicking up and they're like okay my purpose in life is to protect this baby and then it's a set it and forget it you know tens of thousand dollar subscription uh for a thing that you're just GNA the ultimate insurance policy for your kid that has to be the best business I've ever heard of that's good so if anyone has one of those out there I'm still looking to buy them I've never seen one for sale which I think is another signal that it's a very good business 100% what um what's the selling eyes' art thing yeah so this is one thing I noticed whilst I was traveling around Europe have you guys seen this store let me pull it up so how old are you George I'm 30 just turn 30 you got good energy I like your energy this is called an indicator of interest from Sam when Sam starts to ask like exactly so before we do that let's let's talk and P the first 20 minutes of the Pod where it's like does this person have anything interesting to say to now like wait I need more of this guy in my life the second the second British guy says whilst uh I'm like you have my attention that's my favorite word oh it is well can you guys see this so for the people who are listening your eye for art so in Amsterdam right now I walk past the store I walk past the store and in the outside of the store there's this thing where you kind of lean into a telescope and reflecting back from the telescope is your eye and what's fascinating I've got relatively nice eyes I don't get many compliments on them blue eyes say that again George there you go are you gonna get me blushing too much s so you then have you then have certain friends of yours that are probably beautiful eyes they get compliments from all the time what's actually fascinating similar to the personality test when you zoom into to someone's eye even if they've got the ugliest eyes in the world they're beautiful so like my eye I was like wow this is incredible you can even do it where couples like partner their odd and this is one of the fastest growing companies out of Europe right now like it's growing really really fast did you do this I did do it yeah um me and my girlfriend um got the eyes scanned is it like on the wall behind you where is it at no no no it's not it's not on the wall behind me I'm getting it my mom as a guest is it a print or digital what do they do what do they give you you can print it um and then you can do like big blowups on the wall and they charge quite a lot for these things it's like 200 to 3 00 quit and the reason why you like this is because you're all about distribution and you were walking down the street you sell the storefront you can look into this thing and they show you a picture of it and then you pay money to buy it and you sticky idea is emotion times market right so this is everybody's the market and the emotion I think is pretty strong in this yeah it's so personalized to them and it looks beautiful dude and you could buy like you can buy like a necklace or a ring or something of your wife's like eye print correct this is awesome there's probably no repeat purchase here but this is awesome as a one-time thing and it's so much more beautiful even if you think you got boring eyes when they zoom into at that level it's like seeing the universe you go oh my God this is its own mini Universe inside of me I noticed on their landing page they don't have very many uh you know boring black eyes like mine so uh it's all like beautiful greens and blues and Hazel I think you be surprised I think you'd be surprised to quit brenon sh like I think when you get under that it's crazy well I definitely curious like I definitely would want to do this if this was around me I would definitely want to do it I would would certainly do it with my wife or my kids uh because it's just like a thoughtful it's a thoughtful cool thing rather than like you know same old same old so one of the Innovations I'd like to see is could you distribute this online so with smartphone cameras getting better and better is there ability and like AI scanning the image is there something there or is it that you send a little device that sits on the camera that gives even more definition so they could do it at home when all of a sudden you can imagine the advert first of oh dude if you could do this with an iPhone how beautiful your eyes are B Global Market immediately all right I'm gonna send this to somebody to try to make this dude this is awesome I just I just texted this to my wife I said hey let's go to to Europe this is awesome no they have a New York location they if you if you click find gallery they have galleries all over the world so George you said this business is doing well what do you know about them do doing really well from when I went into the store I was like this takes all my like the lot of poer effect right here is taking all my boxes and they said it's like one of the fastest growing startups in um America they open 150 locations in the last year or something like that so it's growing like bananas you guys want to hear something so the other day um have you guys seen this it's mostly women um and it's this thing on T Tik Tok where you go to this place and they hold up colors to your face and they tell you your color palette yeah what what's that called color scale or color grade or like so it's like it's like a where it's like hey what's your blank uh I forget what it's called but anyway my wife wanted to she saw an ad on Tik Tok for it and she was like this looks cool and I was like I'll go and you pay $100 and they rented this tiny like it's like a huge closet basically and you just sit there and they just hold up a shade to you and they go no not that one is it for clothes or for makeup or for everything it's for and and at the end you get this thing and it says you are this one Whatever like there's like 18 categories which means this makeup up this clothing color this all these colors these are your colors and it basically like for me it was like it's all women it's like Margot Robbie like it just said like some other white lady who that's like she is also an example of this person and so you should wear clothing in the winter time that are these colors in the summertime these colors whatever but it's a brick and mortar thing that has been franchised out similarly I imagine to this business and I was like how many of these a day do you have she's like I'm packed I've got uh 14 day and each one has paid $100 and I give HQ like the headquarter company half of it or something like that what was it called what's the name of it yeah and I think I went I think the place that I was called the place that I went it was called the color lab or something like that where it's like signed me up and I T and and it had the same type of stick as this one George where it was like a brick and morar it was franchised it's like dexa yeah there was like a thing outside and you're like yeah of course I have to know like what color I am otherwise I'm G to be ugly it totally got me have you have you seen this guys on like Tik Tok or Instagram it's mostly like a women thing I've heard of the trend the like the color analysis type of thing and I don't George you probably know the the fancy word for these things but there's like so there's the concept of consumerism right which is like you know how Americans basically feel like we we we need to buy certain things we need to like I'll give you the example a friend came um a friend who lives in India came over to visit and they go yeah India's really changed one of the things is like India feels like America we' become consumerized he's like you know before he's like Indians used to have one Max two pairs of shoes he's like but now it's normal to feel like you need like 10 pairs of shoes you need like all the different colors and all that it's like that that's not a real need but it starts to embed itself in culture it's like you almost convince yourself that you need this much this much stuff you need to buy more things and I think that there's like this personal consumerism which is around you need to know X about yourself you need to know your Quantified Health you need to know your color grade you need to know your personality test and I think you can just keep selling into that there just seems to be an increasing amount of consumerism around around the self too not just around uh material things in your house yeah I don't know I don't know the specific thing for it but is this idea of the infinite consumer Abyss you stare into it and it stares back into you dude look at this guy the infinite consumer Abyss just off the Dome that's that why this guy's the guy if I'm gonna if we're gonna have an infinite uh consumer Abyss I'm getting r because according to uh Lily's Color Lab that's that those are my colors wait so you did this or you you made it sound like your wife did this well she was like let's do this and I was like I'm in here's $200 let's his plural yeah like let's find out our colors's your color I don't know dude I didn't use any of it like I don't know I just went to to to experience what it was all about I don't know Sam lilac par let's go I just wear blue and black anyway it was that was that's my color all right let's do the um let's do these other two ideas because I'm curious now uh by the way you know how I know this is a great episode because I feel like I need to get off this and go do these ideas right now like I don't even want to finish this episode I want to go do one of these things right now that's how I know this is a banger all right so let's do number four mold cleanup as a service what do you mean by this yes so one big meme SL wve that I was noticing in America is people becoming more and more concerned about mold in their house yeah people freak out about that in Austin particularly yeah 70% of houses in America apparently have mold in the obviously it varies in terms of the the amount but Downstream effects of autoimmune conditions severe health issues asthma etc etc working backwards from the ad first find out if you have mold in your house like a horrific image of the molds and horrific uh insights into the damage that mold can do you could sell the visit for free and people are ripping up their houses spending tens of thousands of dollars hundreds of thousands of dollars because if it's your home and you have poison in it the like friends that I have that are renting are literally moving out of the house they're not sticking around now so if you actually own the home it's even stickier I like it from a ad perspective a health perspective if you could partner with a big like Health influencer that's your chief influencer officer that could just chat about mold all day and just run the funnel of find out for free and then sell the all the services on the back end similar to what Mar Kel has done for blood optimization with doing get in the house I think there's a lot of money to be made riding that wave and I know Sean you chart about one Shar businesses if you put mold in Google Trends it's just every year like steadily getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger I love that for a bunch of reasons so you what what is that you said 30% of houses have mold 70% 70% okay so that is also killer hook for the ad right 75% of 70% of the houses of houses have mold find out for free if yours does type in your your address and we'll send out a person for free to go to go diagnose and if you know that 70% have something then your conversion even if 10% or 5% of those people are going to spend you know a few thousand dollars getting rid of the mold that's pretty good you could Target you know high value areas you could also just run this as lead gen only so people who do mold servicing probably are not great at Facebook ads and so you could just be the great at Facebook ads part and then Farm out all the leads to mold companies all around the country so that seems like a really good part of this business and then the last thing is like there are so many people that have undiagnosed you know health issues so maybe it's like fatigue maybe it's a bad allergies whatever whatever's going on and you can't find the root cause of these and I think this is why something like gut health has taken off in such a big way because it seems like one of these like yeah if your guts screwed up then everything Downstream is going to be screwed up it could explain 15 different health conditions and so same thing like if your environment is toxic then that could explain 15 different conditions that you might have and who's going to argue that no I want to keep it toxic once you find out that they are you know we had a pest control guy come to our house and he's like yeah see that little like nook under the house that means you have you know mice and rats that are under the house and you know even if you're not seeing them in the house they're here they're at your house would you like me to seal this and like play some traps and I can come by every month and spray I was like cool here's $300 a month go for it and um you know that's a subscri $300 month subscription that I'm on now for the vague possibility that there's like a mice like you know a rodent problem at our house what you're going to learn George moving Austin is that like it's like the most health conscious City I've ever been to and like some people are pretty extreme but it's kind of exciting to be around those extreme people and I know people who have like a brda like a a Berkeley water filter for their all their entire home and uh I started researching it have you guys ever seen the inside of a water heater like a water tank they're horrible disgusting it's horrible you see that there's a picture of somebody literally just holding two like fistfuls of what just looks like either F mold fungus or just like mulch of some kind and so I uh I saw one of these videos where they where they just cut open a water tank like a water tank for the water heater water heater tank autopsy it looks like the it looks like what you would see with like an old coffin that you woke up open up which is like a bunch of like rotted skeleton bones like it's just like what the hell is this I don't even know what this is and it makes you like crawl and so I remember seeing this and I'm thinking is is my water heater like this or my pipes like this I have to get one of these Berkeley water filters I need one of these things um and this is very similar and the difference is is I think getting mold out of your home is either uh it's actually quite hard or in some cases it's impossible I think like I don't know I don't know if the problem I'm not sure if that problem in many cases can actually be solved getting a new water heater uh getting a water filter at your house much more solvable um particularly like my in-laws live in New York City where these buildings are built in the 50s it's a lot of times the similar pipes or the water that goes through New York City it's like pipes have been around for a long time and I remember seeing these these videos of these like water heater like uh where they where they cut them open and do autopsy and I'm like yeah I'm never drinking water from any of this [ __ ] ever again like and I I was like I I need to find a a a I need to find find someplace to replace this that is a in line with what you're talking about and maybe even more of a pungent ad yeah that's a good one should we move on to the next one yeah all right let's do this last one so your final idea I think is a really fun one because it's not even a business it's like a country level idea like you should be the CMO of the UK explain this this idea yeah I like how when BAGI went from like cryptocurrency now trying to build his own country and you go f I've been thinking about companies this entire time people are out here thinking of countries and I don't the cities whisper right he's in Silicon Valley for too long it's like you need to be more ambitious you're starting companies oh that's cute I start countries so one of my Reflections as a coming from the UK and we spoke about it to begin with and experiencing America and despite all the political shenanigans that America has attending Fourth of July in Nashville and I'm going this is wild like there's Flags everywhere there's people chanting USA USA us safe everyone's on the streets so I I was at the end of the day chanting USA and then people were going you can't do that that's why we're chanting because we got rid of you guys and anyway I then reflected on it and I realized that I've never met an American that doesn't celebrate their National Day in some regard and then I realized I've never met a Brit that does celebrate their national day and then I realized I've never met a Brit who even knows the day of their national day well because you guys have been like the bosses like there is no Independence Day you were like the the you like the colonizer right like exactly so that's one of the issues with it so the the irony is by the way the national day is St George's day I'm English called George and I had to Google it it's April the 23rd in England there's no Flags anywhere you can't have national pride and I do think part of it is the colonization side also St George like who was this guy whereas of Independence Day you have a clear enemy so thinking from an advert perspective who is St George it's be Slayer Dragon nobody cares um and essentially canceling St George's day and creating Dunkirk day so yeah the Britain's Finest Hour we've made a lot of mistakes Britain's Finest Hour was when we escaped Hitler Germany 400,000 men with Churchill all of Britain came up together sending the boats across and literally the only reason the country exists and we're not speaking German and arguably Adolf Hitler doesn't conquer the whole of Europe it's because of this de so there's an enemy no matter where you stand politically Adolf Hitler number one enemy when it comes to the ad strategy and make it the most British day imaginable so from Midnight to 12: PM you can complain moan drink tea talk about what's wrong in the past present and future but come 12:00 p.m. get the Raf in the sky get kid stressed as like if you look at the number of British icons Charles Darwin William Shakespeare John Lennon like there's so many like icons of history that the world should be grateful for and I figur you could add billions to the tourist economy of the UK and unite a difficult Nation for at least an afternoon sign me up my friend this sounds awesome we got like we got we could Oasis by the way just announced they're going on tour going yeah he's like Darwin Shakespeare like always Liam gallager but honestly playing wonder wall would not be a bad idea that might be the official song of Dunkirk day that we got so you posted this did anybody like hit you up did you get some like you know a PM in the in the DMS what from who the the the the pr I mean who is the the like I don't know Harry reach out who who's supposed to reach out not yet not yet we're were I'm not gonna I'm gonna keep banging the drum for a while but I honestly you should run ads to your essay to uh to your blog post targeting specifically as hyp specific as you can the Z family 10 grand of AD Spin and I'm pretty sure you're going to get a meeting at the palace uh where we're here to to discuss let's do it let's do it don't go di that's fantastic it it that is like a funny conundrum that England is in when it's like well you guys have been the man for so long that there's not really like a like a started from the bottom now we're here type of story uh it's more like you've been the man for so long and now you're like in fourth uh so like that's like pretty good longevity well the thing is you need the brand right so like I bet if I walked outside right now and I went to like you know just like a a nearby I don't know I if I went to Home Depot and if if it was a busy day at Home Depot I feel like if me if I could get two other people with me to start chanting USA I'm pretty sure the whole store would just start arbitrarily not on a July 4th just start chanting USA because there's this such a pride and USA has like the brand is really really strong right it's like Freedom number one right there's the American dream there's like sort of the the the pride of of America whereas like I think what would the country stand for so you were like drink tea and wine which is like okay that's like you know humorous in a way but like what would be the thing would it be like uh would it be creativity would it be art what what would be the thing that's like we can hang our hat on of like we're the best at the British Pride what is the British Pride about I think from first principles the reason why Independence Day works is because there's an enemy that you escaped and just using creating an enemy again talk about advertising tactics earlier great advert angle but the the enemy of Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany can unite is the only thing that can unite this country I think right so and then just go through the like what whatever you want to pick you want to pick literature you want to pick the industrial re Evolution like we've got some classic hits in the library we've got a lot I think I have an answer to my question to my own question that adds on what you just said which is the UK is sort of like the Harvard of countries it is Ivy League it is prestige it is old money it is old history it is we've been here forever um and the great minds have come from us I think that's the branding which is like the US is more like I don't know a big state school it's a bit of a party school right and whereas you know we're more USC um whereas the UK is more Harvard Yale Princeton um in its in its Vibe and its brand and so it's got that L that old luxury old old money old Prestige brand which is like it's elevated and I think that's that's part of that's what I would lean into more it's not like modern and super high-tech um I would lean into the other side on on The Branding one of my favorite ad campaigns George of all time it was in the 70s it was a Rolex campaign and it would show a picture of uh Dwight Eisenhower uh the general during World War II and then the president of America giving a speech to troops and he had a Rolex on and then it showed um uh an admiral of a great ship uh like giving directions to his uh folks and he looks like he's going to war and he's wearing a Rolex and then I think it's show J JFK wearing a Rolex while he was uh like talking to cast show or something like amazing whatever and it the the headline was The Men Who control the Destinies the The Men Who control the destiny of the world wear Rolex and it's one of my favorite ad campaigns of all time because you you like it makes me associate Rolex with Prestige and like doing something not just being Elite but actually flexing that muscle and uh I've never seen a good idea on how to reuse this uh ad campaign that I love so much but this might be the one where it's like uh the people who have like given the world art or the people who have uh kind of helped shape the destiny of the world or British whatever but that's one of my favorite ad campaigns of all time yeah if you I think the the copy is if you were here tomorrow you'd be wearing a Rolex and he does different variations of that I broke that one down a few times it's it's so hypnotic even that line back if you were here tomorrow you would wear a Rolex with like an image of the White House therefore it aspiration Association of the White House it puts you so it puts you in it that is hypnosis if you spoke to a hypnotist about a sentence that sentence is a literal hypnosis like for example there's a Porsche one that I love Sean and it's um it says um too small to get laid in but you'll get laid the second you get out of it and it's a picture of a Porsche right or the New Balance one right the only the only shoe worn by high fashioned models in London and and Dad's in Ohio right that's like such a good one like I said we broke down a lad of these on the ad Professor so like one of the Porsche ones is honestly now did you spend your youth dreaming about someday owning a Nissan or a Mitsubishi yeah that's good you may get lost but not in the crowd that's another good Porsche one if this car doesn't excite you check your pulse you may be dead so yeah there's there's so many like if you go to the ad Professor on Twitter we've got so many of them talk we we should talk about the ad Professor real quick so you have this marketing agency and to grow it I thought you did a brilliant thing which is you created this Anonymous account on Twitter the ad professor and I think you didn't tell people at the beginning that that was you right nobody knows to this day really well we just there you go breaking news SC came out the closet T YouTube thumbnail George ma comes out Reveals His truth we got it yeah people willon click on that they already know so um he creates a thing that ad professor and all he does is just give it's like I I I love ads which you you do and you collect them and so you just started threading here's just badass ads and then in that people start dming you and it from what I understand it's a better salesman than any sales guy you could have hired to go out and pitch for business is that is that true can you talk a little bit about that yeah um we also then create ads for Brands so like we did one that Fred reach like 30 million people it's like 23 different ads of ads that we've created from like Ryan Air so we did a Tesla one of you're is you you created ads like on spec meaning you pretended Tesla was your client and here's the ad we would make for you Tesla here's the ad we make for you rire and you just did those those also went viral because you really made did a good job of that right exactly so like the Tesla one was it takes I think like 3.4 seconds to to read this ad the same time it takes a Tesla to go to n to 60 this is great and it's a picture of a Tesla driving off this is a a really cool website so you do that and then people just start sliding into your DMs wanting to work with you guys or how do they even know because you don't even say I have an agency by the way right you don't do heavy calls to action on this or or am I wrong a little bit like plug at the end but it's always value thirst and I think that model of who you went to school with and knowing people that way versus just making dope things online and people seeing the ads and realizing that those Porsche ads from the 70s still have relevance today and trying to create ads that are just super sexy there's this weird like I discovered it via looking at um ad horn on Reddit and there's like hundreds of thousands of communities dedicated to people chatting about Adorn um and then created the ad Professor off the back of that but yeah nobody knew it was me until today I guess does this make good Revenue we do okay and how many people work they're great say the name of your agency by the way so that people can go find you guys yeah just just go to adpr professor.com Sam was mentioning the website then um we have about 40 people give or take wow this is awesome and you're this is really cool I I would like to use you guys thank you I feel sold like when I go to this website I'm like this is cool and i' I I follow I've followed that Twitter handle I thought it was really cool all right we are going to split this so that was part one of an episode with George Mack that was ideas ideas ideas I thought he had some bangers in there the next part we're going to do is his Frameworks which is actually what he's more known for this guy has published essays and tweets that are he gets retweeted by Elon Musk like once every week so he has some really awesome ideas and Frameworks that he has curated or uniquely come up with we're going to talk about those that's all part two with George Mack the Big Ideas [Music]

all right I want to tell you something so I have a family now and do you have a will weird Flex all right uh yes I do have a will okay so once I have a family like you start getting into the will stuff right and it's kind of been screwing with me and I read a story last week that has maybe changed my life and I think that if only a couple of listeners actually buy into what I'm buying into this could be like the most like life-changing thing that we've ever done on this podcast [Music] so in the 1800s in Sweden there was this guy named Alfred and Alfred was an inventor and he had a little bit of success where he started inventing some like a bunch of small stuff but then when he was like 30 or 40 he had something that changed his life so he basically found out that nitroglycerin if you mess with it in a certain way you can make it explosive and thus was the creation of dynamite and so it made him incred Rich so he got super rich he was worth something like the equivalent of or300 million in today's money and towards the end of his life his brother Ludwig died and when his brother died someone ran an obituary for Alfred on accident they used the wrong brother and the obituary Started With The Merchant of death is no longer and they go on to explain how Alfred created dynamite and how it was revolutionized the way people were murdered now whether that story is true or false that's actually uper to debate no one has disproved it but there's like people like I'm not sure if that's actually true but that's the story and afterwards Alfred changed his life he goes that's that's ridiculous I can't be known as the person who is The Merchant of death I have to change this and so two years before he died he decided to rewrite his will and he left 95% of his assets towards a foundation where he created the rules and the rules were I'm going to give and this is I'm using today's money but it's it's the equivalent money back then I'm going to give $1 million to the person who impacted Humanity the most the category that I want to start with is peace but after peace we're going to do a few other categories we're going to do peace we're going to do chemistry economics and literature and thus became the Nobel Peace Prize and to this day it's lasted for you know 130 years where they now have like $600 million in assets and the whole point of the foundation is we invest enough money so we are always able to give something like the equivalent of a $5 million a year to some type of uh person who has impacted the world the most and winners have been like Marie Curry Martin Luther King Ernest Hemingway like a lot of these like pretty like groundbreaking people and in a way this contest it it's encouraged like I don't think there's too many people that are doing some stuff just to win the Nobel Peace Prize but in the back of their head they're like yeah like that would be amazing if like I can like discover something and like like you know that's like the ultimate goal like to get a Nobel Peace Prize like that's like the greatest thing ever and so it kind of changed my life by the way did you know that story that Dynamite story and The Merchant of death not the specifics I had heard Peter te was talking about this with Joe Rogan like the the sort of whitewashing of a reputation and they were talking about Epstein they were talking about Bill Gates and Rogan brought up he's like that's how the Nobel Prize happened and he's like have you heard that pet is like yeah you know the dynamite guy but I didn't know anything beyond that so that's actually pretty cool I didn't know The Merchant of death obituary story so the truth of it is that like dynamite actually wasn't used to kill that many people because of the way it worked like TNT killed a lot of people but like so like open up caves for Mining and [ __ ] right it was like so that's where like the story is like you know who knows but we don't let the truth get in the way of a good story yeah but what is true is that the Nobel Peace Prize has worked like it's encouraged people and like through incentives to do stuff sorry so explain the money side of this so he left how much money to this and then is it just been draining from that pot or does new money get injected into the no it's a million dollars per prize right is that right yeah and there's five per year and like one year during the world World War II they were like we don't have peace so we're not going to give a Peace Prize and so they like just didn't give a prize and so but in general every year for the last 120 years they've done this and so the money right now it's six they have this is all public so you can see it they have $612 million it made a 10.7% return on Capital in 2023 it's invested in Equity Funds hedge funds and the way that it's set up according to his will was make sure that the money never runs dry so we can always give we can always give this away for potentially hundreds of years right um and so there's like a organization I think and you can see what their expenses are I think their expenses to run this thing are like three or or eight million I forget exactly single digit Millions per year to operate and then they give away roughly $5 million per year and is this like Forbes 30 30 or like how legit are the winners of the nio P priz now I've never paid too much attention to it do you have a sense of like is this High signal or is this like a hijacked thing that now is is is not high signal anymore so in my opinion it's very high signal so Albert Einstein Martin Luther King Marie Curry like these like legit people have done it now there have been a few times where they've made mistakes so for example now they have a rule where they actually want to give the award a couple years after the person made the discovery because in 1926 they gave the award to someone who created the enzyme that cured cancer and obviously that wasn't true but like six months after they discovered it they thought it was true and then the other criticism is they have a liberal bias and so they've given one to Barack Obama they've given one to I believe uh an Israeli guy once like a pece award and and then the people who side with Palestine are like what the hell that's there's no peace so there's criticism sometimes but in general it's very well regarded although a lot of people will uh criticize it as being too academic or too liberal but I think it's like uh as legit as it could be and what what's your take on this so awesome story so here's my take my take is that this prize setup is awesome and let me give you a few examples of this so inspired by the Nobel Peace Prize in 199 there was this guy named Raymond or I think his name is or let's call him orteg Raymond orteg and so he was like hey these planes that we're we've created are pretty amazing but we're not doing like too many great things with them he goes I'm going to offer $25,000 to anyone out there who can fly from New York City to Paris this was in 1919 you offered 25 Grand that's like $500 Grand today and like eight people signed up and seven of them failed and in fact five of them died now who's the one person who made it Charles Lindberg and the year after Charles Lindberg did his flight it says that airline passengers before he did it that year were 5,000 a few years after 300,000 and it completely changed the airline industry because it made like a big hoopla and a big deal whatever then inspired by that prize this guy named Peter diamandis is that his name yep he created this thing called The X prize where he was like I offer $10 million I think the rules were anyone who can fly a rocket into space bring it back down and two weeks later it goes right back into space so like reusable rockets and Elon Musk at the time I think SpaceX was two years old he said the xprize basically helped create the commercial space industry it showed that you didn't have to be a giant Aerospace company to make progress in space and it definitely influence influenced the direction I took with Space X so this was like a big deal for like space and now the genius of the X prize was that you by putting up 10 million and I think it became 20 million for the prize people would like a bunch 20 teams would invest 2 million each in trying to develop the thing to win the $10 million prize and so you would get 40 million invested for a 10 million price so it was a kind of Genius way to Spur Innovation and investment so not just people who want to win the prize because that's obvious put a prize up people will try to go win it but actually in the act of winning it more dollars got poured in because they saw a clear return and the math worked out where oh wow I get leverage my 10 actually becomes a 100 invested in this Mission if I get enough interest around it along with the pr along with the the want to just win and to make this exciting and so it works and so now there's a SpaceX prize that Elon has funded where it's a $100 million for someone who if by 2030 they can remove a certain amount of carbon from the planet or or something like that and so it's still ongoing here's another example so you know what DARPA is have you heard of DARPA it stands for defense Advanced research projects agency have you heard of that yeah weren't they like responsible for creating the internet they've done a bunch of stuff and so in in 2003 they created this thing called the grand prize and the idea was we have 15 50 m road trip or like a route and the first person who can create an autonomous vehicle that can drive that route wins $1 million and6 teams or something that applied and for a little while no one did it but then a team did it and that's when the first time we ever used lar which is a type of self-driving technology that all the cars or many of the cars have it was already existed but it was applied to cars for the first time ever and so it was very successful and then there's actually a guy who I think maybe you might know this guy his name is Nat fredman he's he's a really good guy to follow really interesting guy he's doing a lot of stuff with AI investing right now and I know about this prize that he's got it's really cool I believe it's um what's the right phrase is it herculian text so basically I think it was like one of the there was an explosion in uh I think Italy you know vvus yeah mount vvus exploded and all these ancient Greek texts got basically ruined and he puts up a prize to where if you can create uh you basically have to use machine learning if you can create this algorithm that can help him dis diser parts of the text he'll give you a price yeah so it's like a scroll that is like been almost sealed you can't unscrolling just read it so what they're using is computer vision to try to analyze it from the outside and just from like the little bits you can see and try to figure out what was written I think this is going to be like the earliest written text or something like that I forgot I don't know the details I somebody can go look this up but I remember hearing about this and thinking wow this was so cool like he he sort of found this thing nobody was going to be a nobody was going to justify the investment they would take to see this because you also don't know what's inside you don't know if there's anything interesting inside necessarily and he decided to you know fund this competition and I guess what happened recently was somebody figured out how to read a bit of it actually they had like a breakthrough in the vvus prize where somebody figured out how to read a little bit of the thing from like some stupidly simple technique on of computer vision all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show yeah and so it's still a thing by the way and like people are still getting after it and then the last thing is there's this thing called kaggle kaggle competitions yeah where it was a startup that raised $12 million it was eventually bought by Google according to their website they've had1 million Engineers compete in their competitions and if you're a company you could put a bounty out there and people will compete to win it so for example you remember Microsoft Connect like the camera that you put on your Xbox that it could like watch you play and somehow interact with that I believe was heavily developed by one of these competitions but then they do other things for HIV research and things like that where this gamifying system has actually contributed to like big important problems and so all of this to say when you're thinking about or when I'm thinking about when I die what will happen to money you know you think about giving away to family you think about just like traditional giving away do you just you just wire it to someone and hope they do well I'm incredibly fascinated and interested in these competitions and they don't all need to be huge I think there's one guy who you particularly like Aubrey deg great where he has a $25,000 a year if you come with some interesting break through on longevity he will give you 25 Grand and then you get you get to go meet with him right and so sometimes they're huge sometimes they're not huge but I think this is like so much more leverage and the publicity and the the wanting to win it seems so much more better for society to do a contest and it's also more work but than just giving you know what I mean 100% so I love this topic and there's a bunch of interesting angles by the way can I read you the just the vesuvian thing because I think it's pretty fascinating quick yeah they were able to take four passages with 140 characters each and get 85% of the characters readable recoverable is it just someone's like grocery list yeah exactly uh and they use you know AI blah blah blah I don't know all the the the details of this he did a good podcast with um Ben Thompson on Str that's where I heard him talking about this I wish if I knew we were talking about this I could have looked it up but I I heard this like six months ago I was getting a haircut I thought it was pretty fast so what did the strolls say so do you get a haircut when you have earbuds in your ears I won't go to a barber shop if they don't let me listen to something while while I'm getting my haircut oh my God all right like if they try talking I'm just like nothing can't hear and by the way it falls out like four times during every haircut and I'm like oh sorry can you get that uh and they're like dude this is annoying that's why I started having air a guy come to my house and just do it there so I could just listen on blast but then I felt kind of weird cuz he was also listening to these like old Max Levin talks from like 2002 and uh he's like what is who is this why is this guy talking about like the future of the internet I'm like yeah yeah it's before the internet was like that huge of a deal God that's so rude but whatever we'll we'll rude well back to the Scrolls it's like going to a sports bar and I don't want to talk to the barart turn I want to watch the game that's what I'm TR that's what I'm trying to do right I I'm the customer the customer have the experience that they want so it's says to to to date our efforts have managed to unroll and read about 5% of the first scroll so that's like you know the amount of Headway that they've made so far the the general subject of the text is pleasure which properly understood is the highest good in their philosophy the two Snippets are talking about I guess talking about pleasure so one author thinks as to in the case of food we do not right away believe things that are scarce to be absolutely more pleasant than those that are abundant I I don't know what's going on but it's basically a philosophy text okay so that's pretty cool so can I tell you about my take on this so early on in the podcast I think I I had one of the ideas which was SpaceX or sorry the X prize for companies and I basically realized that a lot of companies when I when I was inside of twitch after we got acquired I was like man we had this whole situation where they were trying to build things internally but they didn't have like the best team on it they didn't have like the best focus on it they didn't have their highest sense of urgency then you have startups that are often like really high Cali teams small groups of people super high urgency super high motivation it's their baby so they they treat it like life or death whereas in a company you're not going to treat that way and I thought well in the end we ended up getting acquired for like a you know small medium acquisition and I was like you know if I had just known upfront that they would be willing to pay for this we could have just built it better and faster knowing that hey there's a eight figure Payday on the other side of this and they would have also happily been like cool whoever can make the best version of this you get this money and we don't have to fund internally the product development and have one shot on goal so I was like why wouldn't a company that's a good idea just said 10 million bucks for the person who could build the the team that could build the best X and then when and the conditions are when if you hit it we have the first right to buy it you can't sell it to anybody else we get to hire you and the team and you guys get will come on for for it basically earns out over two years and you know here's the scope of what we want so you're not guessing oh will will Facebook want to buy us it's like no no Facebook's telling you what they want and then you get 25 teams to go try to be the winners of that prize because hey you actually don't need like know maybe Venture Capital you're like Hey we're going to take nine months and try to build this thing and try to win the prize right and I feel like that should exist I'm surprised that that doesn't exist that was the first idea second is I actually tried this so did I ever tell you about the the prize we created for milk Road no so when we were doing the milk road we were like all right it's pretty clear that in crypto there's like you know the the money use case which is hey just like save your money in Bitcoin or a currency that is not that cannot inflate it's not designed for inflation and so I get that use case but then people were talking about web 3 it's going to change everything you're going to have all these apps decentralized apps social social decentralized apps where you own your content all this crazy stuff right but nobody actually had built any of them it was just like a bunch of VCS talking about it in circles or lame white papers whatever the hell that is yeah white papers and like insane funding but like they would build a prototype but nobody would use it right so we we came up with an idea we were like Hey how do we at milk road if we're this C crypto newsletter we believe in crypto why don't we create our own little Grant and so we created a grant called The Milk Money Grant we're like this is not enough to get rich but it's a little bit of milk money right it's enough where you can justify spending like two or three months on a project and it was one eth which at the time was like maybe two or three grand and so we had I think over like 2,000 submissions and we we said you could build whatever you want it's some use case or application of crypto and there was like so we ended up picking 10 or 12 people so we gave away probably what what is that like you know 36 Grand and we just use our like ad Revenue money to like pay that out we just treat it as an expense of the business and then we got to meet these people and there were super interesting young High Caliber people that were building really interesting things and even though they were probably already making more than two or three grand in their job it just felt like a road scholarship it felt like they got accepted that they were getting paid to do something they had an excuse to go like scratch this itch and that's the way we framed it we're like what's an itch you want to scratch it doesn't need to be the biggest project but something you want to see built that you want to use what would it be and then people built all kinds of things and it was a fantastic experience it was honestly really really awesome and I forgot about it until now actually it's something I I want to do again I have a couple ideas of what I might do with it do you want to talk about those or no I have a specific idea that um I want to fund and I want to fund it in maybe a it's not even going to be that big of a business so it might be just like a philanthropic way but is my my version of the young husters Grant so the other day I was sitting around I was thinking about my time in college because I have a cousin who's who just got accepted into college two cousins actually and they were like what what advice would you have and I was like well what do you want do you know what you want or do you not know what you want if you don't know what you want you should just spend that time dabbling go meet a bunch of people try a bunch of things do a shadow a bunch of people go try to figure out what what the menu even is and maybe what type of stuff do you like seafood do you like steak chicken salads what do you what do you want and one of them was like I know what I want I want to be an entrepreneur and I was like cool he's like so that's why I'm doing this like Business program and whatever I'm like awesome they're not going to teach you how to be an entrepreneur in college that's not what's actually going to happen there right I I know what you're thinking same thing I thought if I go to school and I get a business degree then I will you know how to run a business and start run I know how to start a business and run a business it's like no that's not at all what you're going to get out of that so I said here's the best thing you can do I said actually this is something that every college campus could have this and I think it is the best college campus business that I can think of for somebody like like me so if you're listening to podcast maybe you're wired like me or s and that is to create the onion for your campus so here's the here's why um I don't know about you but when I was in college like the campus paper was like a big deal maybe now with yeah like smartphones being awesome and social maybe this is dead and I'm a boomer no there it's still around because you love to read about yourself and your friends yeah exactly you want to know what's going on on your campus what's the news what happened with your teams Etc also there was like it's like the procrastination element of it where there's like the sidoku and there's like the cross word and there [ __ ] you could do while you're in class so the camp every at my school at Duke everybody read the Duke Chronicle and I never thought about it I didn't even know who wrote it I didn't even consider what was going on there but if I was smart what I would have done is say I'm actually going to create a little business here on campus I'm G to create a Duke newspaper but of course first rule of business different is better than better so I'm not going to create just another school newspaper that's reporting just the facts I'm going to create the onion for my campus so it's basically a satirical News newspaper this will teach me a bunch of skills I'll get the skills of creating a business how do you start a business I'll get the skills of content creation so copywriting humor creating a Content schedule content pipeline hiring and firing people uh getting ad sales and AD Revenue distribution how am I going to get people to to read this product differentiation marketing naming the thing and it's the perfect type of business for college because it's sandbox so I think one pressure a lot of people have when they're in college they want to be an entrepreneur is they try to think of businesses that are like the businesses they read about on TechCrunch or they like big money Mak things yeah I'm going to create the next big thing that's that's really hard and also you're a beginner you're a white belt so you don't go look at the moves that black belts do necessarily maybe like learn the best white belt moves and you need a white belt business for me that was my sushi restaurant thing my my virtual sushi restaurant yours it was like the hot dog thing and then your like college uh you know like booze business or whatever right we had little like starter businesses that themselves are not meant to last but they teach you a whole bunch of like the core building block skills that when you lump them together is this thing called business so you're going to encourage them to create the onion for college exactly so I want basically people who are I don't know how many college kids listen to this to be honest but if you if you are or you have a kid in college I want a hustler on every campus so like one Hustler to create their version of the the campus paper and I got to figure out the details but I'm down to basically put in some amount of money like 10 grand or 15 grand to like Kickstart people on this thing I don't think it'll take much money I think 10 grand will be more than enough to to start these on several campuses and I think they should become self-sustaining cash flow businesses from there and I think that the people who run these will be way far ahead and people don't even know like for example bar stool you know how bar stool started a physical paper that he like gave to colleges right not colleges exactly but yeah in Boston he would so it was it was basically a physical newspaper that Dave would write under I think pen names and it was you can go find the the font is so funny it's like comic sands on the internet I think he even bought or he used other people's newspaper like the free newspaper that you pull the the like you pull out that piece of glass and then you can grab one you know what I'm saying like I he bought it like he I think he bought a few of his own and he like literally placed them on Corners where it was like the you know like those free newspaper things and it was mostly a gambling newspaper it was like a gambling rag he called it and what he would do is in the morning he would write the thing or whatever he'd get it printed and then he would sorry the previous night he would write the thing get it printed and then in the morning he would rush into the subway and he' just be handing it out to people getting on the subway in Boston or getting on the whatever the underground is there and um that's how bartool got its initial distribution and then he would hand them out all day then he would go home he would be calling advertisers to try to get like enough money to print the thing again and then he would write the thing under all of his pen names and work on his copyrighting seals then he would go get them printed and figure out how to manufacture a product and the next day he would go distribute it again and over time he got like other people to hand them out and other people to write the thing and other people to do the ad sales and it became bar stool which is this like you know many hundred million dollar company for for Dave but that's how it started that's amazing yeah uh you should go The Listener you guys should go and Google and see the early ones it's pretty hilarious so I'm thinking about after this I'm going to put up a Google doc that's that's my called a I'm gonna put up a Google doc figuring out what are my actual rules and who am I looking for and how to apply put in the show notes of this thing I'm just gonna make an open doc anybody can can read and submit to and I'm going to think of a name because I think the name matters and I'm also I'm going to treat it like a so every campus will have like the same naming convention and then we'll share the learning so if you're the kid at Northwestern you're going to be able to and some kid at Duke comes up with a good distribution idea we're just gonna make one group chat where like all the people are like kind of sharing what's working and what's not and I'm really curious to see what happens and to me this is my version of like the lemonade stand it's like the slightly Superior Lemonade Stand uh type of business that I think would be great I wish I had done this in college so I'll take my bow because I have successfully potentially rather proven that this idea might be one of the bigger ones that we've ever talked about it's it actually is quite exciting even like you're talking 10 $10,000 and a newspaper which is like a silly thing but it's awesome like that's awesome and that's kind of the point with this is like these things when you repackage charity or whatever you want to call this into a game it kind of makes it exciting it makes it fun it makes it cool yeah what's the name for this sort of action philanthropy right it's like it's not charity for the completely improvers but you are giving people both inspiration maybe capital and an excuse to go and better their lives or improve their lives live up to their potential like take the next step is there a name for for this where you're not it's not starving kids in Africa but it is you know kind of broke college kids who now have something to get excited about what what would you is there a name for something like that I got to think about it but I would in my head I've been calling it incentivized philanthropy that's that's too that's too much of a mouthful so we we have to think about it what this really comes down to is just a slight differing incentivization has like massive difference in the in the outcome versus just giving versus no only one of you are got are you g to get this and you all got to get after it so there's a few versions of this by the way that I've thought about in the past one um so when the teal Fellowship came out I thought it was genius Peter teal basically had this point of view that universities are a bubble and that we they have this Halo this umbrella where you can never criticize a university college what education it's the most important thing for our kids how dare you I thought it was crazy when I heard about it he's like education might be the fifth thing that they do and he called it he said education is a bundle and I forgot what he bundled it as but he was like it's a insurance policy for the parent you give them you make sure your kid gets this degree because that is a uh my kid's not going to fall through the cracks of society Insurance he's like and then it's a filtering process so he's like for companies they don't care what you learned at Harvard but if Harvard did a good job filtering then I already know I'm picking from you know the the smarter end of the crop when it comes to hiring so it's a filtering bundle uh it's a social social piece that's part of the bundle then there's the education component that's part of the bundle and he had like five or six things that he's like together those are all part of it he's like what's going to happen is people are going to unbundle the bundle and so what he did was he came out and said I think universities are such a waste that if you're a high potential person I will come out with the teal Fellowship I will pay you 120 Grand I think it was to drop out of college and if you're in college I will pay you to drop out and Peter teal for all of his like very UNS smooth uncharismatic ways of speaking the guy's kind of a master of communication if you just don't make him speak uh give you know give a talk and you're not looking at the The Poetry of it the FL if you if you read an article about his presentation and see the quotes it's the best it's it's the best and he by the way Peter de literally has speech writers so when he has a point he'll go on tour and he'll give his speech universities are a bubble and it's not that he just said that off the cuff it's like he has a point of view that actually the universities there's something going on with them and it's there sort of a uh a um um a a weird thing going on that's what he does and then the speech writers are like so are you saying that universities are a bubble yep nail cool headline all right great what's the what's the subhead right and so he he gets it basically workshopped himself and his team and then he literally goes on tour he's done this a couple times he did it with the 0o to one thing which is that and he does he uses a provocative statement so he says University is a bubble he something that he knows is going to basically it's a head turner um you're sa thing MBA students are have negative impacts on new companies yeah or he'll say um by the time the NBAs are in the alpha is gone right like once the NBAs are flooding into a space the opportunity is gone but the bigger one that he did was when he did his book zero to one he went on tour instead of saying buy my book I'm Peter teal I've had great business success you know I've shared some of my lessons is it competition is bad competition is for losers yeah okay and he's like oh this idea in capitalism that you know competition it brings out the best in us no competition is for losers he said the only goal of a business is shoot for Monopoly oh Monopoly I thought that's illegal you literally you get broken up if you're in Monopoly and he's like exactly so he finds the head turning thing and when he has it he builds like a pretty convincing case so he did this with the teal fellowship and he paid kids to drop out of school like wow what a what's the worst influence you could have on my child is convincing them to drop out of school drop out of their education how many kids a year do it do you know um I remember I hosted them at my office I think the first or second year of the teal fellowship and there was like 20 kids in it is there was like 20 like 19y olds or 18y olds were like at my office and I was like hey who who are you guys what are you doing and they're like oh we don't know it was super disorganized by the way and Peter teal was not there all right so I appla I apply and one of Peter Teal's team members selects however many people you said six or eight people MH they wire you the money and they just said do they say come back to me with three months with a thing no no you at the time I don't know what it is now but at the time you would get accepted you would drop out they' give you the money you would come to San Francisco and you would participate in the batch and so you would live there I don't know if you live together but they were all I mean they all show up in my office so they were definitely there for at least a period of time I'm not sure if it was the whole program or what but it was pretty open-ended and it was long does a 100 Grand go towards starting your company or is it $100,000 plus three months of rent it's a two-year $100,000 gr for young people who want to build new things instead of sitting in a classroom nice uh 20 or 30 people per year you got to be 22 or younger to do it you'll need to drop out in order to have it you don't have to move to San Francisco and an idea is enough that's that was the idea of it it's been going for I don't know 10 years now so here's some of the notable recipients so the CEO uh and founder Dylan field of figma which is a $50 billion company I think tens of billions of company then there's oo rooms which was like a a Hotel style startup out of India that also was worth uh many many billions there's Austin Austin Russell the guy who created luminar Technologies which uh I think he became the youngest billionaire ever uh it was like self-driving technology and then of course the founder of uh ethereum which is a who knows hundreds of billions of dollars uh value creation thing then there's the founder of loom I didn't know that which was a startup that was acquired for hundreds of millions of dollars the Josh Browder from do not pay which I love and then there's like other things that I don't know about because they maybe they're not for-profit but there's like a guy who created a software to detect Parkinson's disease and then there's a handful of like recipients like that where maybe they're behind the scenes but doing amazing stuff so I guess that's been a very I he probably didn't do it for money but if he wanted to there was a return on it but there's definitely a return on like I encouraged value creation right oh yeah I me if even one of those if just ethereum had come out of it I mean smashing success if just figma had come out of it smashing success so those are like the two power law winners of The Thing by the way go to musk foundation.org because I just saw that Elon Musk was the biggest donor he donated I think $2 million to that Vivian challenge So Daniel gross and that Friedman put up 2K and the musk Foundation put up two million describe what you see all right so musk foundation.org it's uh a website with no design it's a blank piece of paper with five bullet points and it says musk Foundation grants are made in support of renewable energy human space exploration pediatric research science and uh and engineering education development of artificial intelligence to benefit Humanity that's it it's like a hello world page yeah yeah it's basically 100 words bullet pointed on a white piece of paper and this is one of the like extreme like you know Money Talks wealth Whispers thing yeah I call um sexy indifference like that's what we're going to call this where you want people to know that you don't care but you also want them to know that you don't care because you're cool so I'm GNA call it sexy indifference it's the homeless billionaire Paradox right yeah yeah the difference between a homeless man and a billionaire at face value is so small in San Francisco you will not be able to tell the difference right it's in the takeway being sometimes you could just be sexy and different in the very beginning and you become successful like you could just like but so we're going to call it sexy indifference I saw a LinkedIn the other day that was no profile photo on line bio one job experience 26 years owner and I was like here's a man who's GNA leave a lot of money for his children yes I can tell you that right now I don't know anything about this company name never heard of this guy I can tell you right now this guy's Gonna Leave a lot of money to his children you don't get 26 years owner no profile photo LinkedIn that's that's like such a high signal thing to do or at worst he own is a really nice lake house or again he's broke and he's homeless we don't know actually he could go either way but it's one way or the other by the way I bought the Peter teal shirt from The Joe Rogan podcast I'm gonna wear it next week on the Pod it was like a $120 shirt right the uh the all-white meshnet um Peter teal shirt from from sax with just I'm just teasing it right now subscribe on subscribe on YouTube and you'll get to see me wear it at it's made for hairy people uh mesh usually is not not a great choice for us but yeah I think my I will go up like six or seven points if I wear it yeah you're GNA look like human Velcro with all these like little threads sticking out I saw people talking about his shirt uh I thought it was pretty funny he uh he also had the uh the Nazi haircut uh which is like totally in which is like you you do like a a high fade a high fade he looked good um yeah he looked good I thought he looked great he looked great um weather but other than that he's he seems to be on like kind of a a a bit of a Rejuvenation kick well he I mean he's like how old he's like 56 he's all he he can he can look 56 but he looks great he looks a little bit younger than 56 but if you've heard of cool contests like this or even a cool name for what this is called uh tweet at me I'm at the S par because this stuff is very fascinating to me and I'm trying to understand like the economics of it because I think I might actually do it so are you going 50-50 with me on the uh the MFM scholarship I'm not willing to commit to that yet I here but I I'm trying to do it look I I'm a slower person than you I'm thinking like the par family like where where it's going to go but oh dude the par 4 you use a golf Pun It's pretty yeah I gotta figure out something what did you call it par 4 yeah the par four but you I can't decide if you want to go cheeky or like extra serious like when you look at the Nobel Peace Prize like they're wearing like the like the suits with the tails you know what I mean well you know how it is you're you know what you're going to do you're going to go cheeky on the front end deadly serious on the execution I feel like that's you I think that's what we might do but I I like I told we had the conversation with like uh with my wife I'm like I I because like we actually have to sign documents and I'm like should we do something like this and what what what are we gon to do what what are we G right now I'm I'm dude I was I'm obsessed with like single motherhood because like have you ever has your wife like whenever you got to like a single parent for the day like when your wife's gone or whatever I'm like this is impossible yeah it's impossible it's not do it actually can't be done um so that's my yeah so I'm like H if you're a single mother how do you get ahead like you know if you want to like so it's like a cycle so anyway I'm think I'm like obsessed at that at that problem right now I'm trying to figure out how to how we could contribute to making their those people's lives better all right what do you want to do I'll give you a simple useful lesson learn from Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos okay somebody asked Elon um about hiring they go Elon when you do you interview people still and when you interview them for hiring what what do you ask them how does Elon Musk filter for great talent have you ever seen what he said no I I well I've heard one thing where he says if I'm talking to someone and I and like you know every once in a while like 45 seconds in you could be like o this is a bad match he's like I just act on that so like if 60 seconds in I'll just be like hey I don't want to talk anymore and he just walks away it's like his version of like getting a haircut with headphones in yeah let me uh he's like no so what he said was tell me about the toughest problem you've dealt with and how you dealt with those at your last company or project he goes I like this question because it filter out filters out candidates who haven't actually done anything and you can ask them very detailed questions about it and they will know the answer whereas the person who was not actually responsible for doing the thing won't know the details and so it's a very quick filtering mechanism other questions that came from other people so Steve Jobs used to ask why are you here and so he's like I want to understand their motivation why are you even at why do you why are you here for this interview why this company why this job why you is the the most important thing that Steve Jobs said I know that Jeff Bezos asked a question about do you consider yourself a lucky person I was gonna say I interviewed with Joe gbia the founder of Airbnb and he was like a the last person and it's just 15 minutes and the only question he asked me was on a scale of 1 to 10 how lucky are you and what' you say I said I'm a nine I go you know I'm lucky for a variety of reasons and I explain them and then I said I don't know if it's luck or what it is but like I I seem to get my way a lot and he and I Go why'd you ask that and he said well because if Luck's real I want to be around lucky people and even if it's not real I want to be around people who tend to get their way yeah exactly and I was like all right that's I guess that's good so Dan Rose who worked for Bezos in the early days I think like 1999 to 2006 so he's a fun person to read about yeah he's a good follow on on Twitter as well because he shares some good like personal stories from the basis ER so it'll be like in 99 we were struggling with this and we were sitting at our office sit in the stairwell uh because we didn't have time to make desks it's like oh nice so he goes Jeff bezos's favorite interview question was are you a lucky person it was a great way to filter for optimists and people who manifest success he goes if you're a successful optimistic person The Humble leader right answer for this starts with I'm the luckiest person on Earth I worked really hard to get where I am but a lot of things had to go right for me and I've taken full advantage of my luck that's essentially like not the exact words but that is the Crux of what you want them to say which is I've worked really hard but it took a tremendous amount of luck and I take advantage of Lucky breaks when they present themselves to me and he goes sorting for optimistic people is a good proxy for leadership potential and likelihood of success perceiving yourself as lucky is a proxy for optimism basically people will always tell you they're you know they're optimistic about things but they won't always say that they're lucky so it's kind of like a stealth question to to get at the optimism thing it goes the humility part is also important if it's easy to filter out false humility humble brags are very obvious when you ask follow-up questions he goes this isn't the only question but it's a conversation starter and opens the door to someone's personality beyond their resume there's two wrong answers number one no I'm I've never really gotten lucky but I've been able to overcome and outwork all the bad things that happened to me and no I never needed luck because I'm better smarter stronger faster than everybody else and there's a third answer which is like no I've been pretty unlucky in which case it's like I don't want to be around unlucky people yeah like I don't want to be around you uh yeah ex yeah and that's what Joe that's what Joe told me he was like if you're really lucky you're either Lux real in which case I would be around you or you just make it work and if you're say a one or a two you're either unlucky if Luck's real I don't want to be around that [ __ ] either or you just think you're a victim and I don't want to be around that so that that's how he explained it to me have you and I thought it was weird by the way I I thought it was weird at the time looking back I think it was better I actually interviewed also at Google years ago they asked me like how many days would it take you to like clean clean the windows on like a skyscraper or something like that and I didn't like that question I hated that question me too one thing that interview questions if another way to think about them is they're meant to filter out certain people and they're meant to pull in other people right so a great interview question will not just assess the person they will either attract or repel the wrong cultural fit and so I think one of the Google things is like part of the reason I would would hate that question is part of the reason they don't want to hire me right like they they want basically puz puzzle solving nerds and I heard this put really well so max Levon I think was was the one that you know the Creator PayPal he was talking about he goes when I got acquired by Google I was like how do they retain smart people here because they're trying to hire the most brilliant people on Earth and then they're telling them go like tweak the knob on Google AdSense like go get us like a little Edge it's like not only is that soulless but it is like literally like almost the definition of a cog in the machine he goes the way they keep those people around is he's like literally in the bathrooms they would have like really hard puzzles on the Stalls and he's like they would give people like a he's like they had 20% time which was like 20% time just go work on whatever the hell you want he's like they would have puzzles on the walls in the in the stall he's like because the actual work that we needed you to do would never like it's not like Mission driven enough it's not hard enough to like intellectually stimulate you so they had all these other ways of intellectually stimulating you and to coddle you like we'll do your laundry we'll feed you we'll nurse you we you need a bath go ahead there's sponge bath over there on the right they would do everything they could to keep Talent there and one of the things that he talked about was like you know um the PayPal Mafia is probably the most successful early group of people to come together in Silicon Valley right they they basically created you know they had Elon they had Peter teal they had Max Leon they they went on to create like I don't know 10 plus billion dollar companies out of the like first 15 people there the smallest things of the PayPal Mafia was like Yelp yeah exactly like the guy at Yelp is like you know sitting at the kids table at their reion no offense Jeremy he's a good dude so so the thing with PayPal was they treated it they they go we're trying to create a cult they go the idea of diversity is not what you want at a startup now you couldn't really say this today but they're on the record of saying this a long time ago which is that you want a certain type of person because that breeds a certain type of culture so you you know pick the culture and then you only want to attract people that are going to like re force that culture and you want to like immediately like repel otherwise smart people who would dilute that culture and so for him I remember there was a famous one which was he they were interviewing an engineer and the guy said you know they're like what do you like to do outside of work and he's like I love playing basketball and they Max was like I don't want to hire this guy like what because he plays basketball he's like I've never met a great engineer who L who says he loves to play pickup Hoops he's like great Engineers have other hobbies and he's like and he's like even if we're wrong it's the thing that monish said on the podcast monish P said when he met Warren Buffett he goes Warren you're a great judge of people how do you do it man how did you get your people radar so good he goes I don't think I have a good people radar he goes what I have is a very tight filter he goes so if you take me to a cocktail party and you let me talk to 100 people for five minutes each in that five minutes I could probably take the the worst five or seven people and I'll tell you these people are lousy don't hire them and the best five or seven people I could probably tell you them he's like and then the other you know 85 90 people I don't know I couldn't make a judgment on them in five minutes it wasn't obvious to me so I put them all in the no pile and go well isn't that like a little harsh you know there was there might be some great people in there he goes yeah but the cost of bringing a not great person into my circle of life is so high the cost of dis discarding somebody who might be great is nothing is is so low comparatively he's like so I am willing to be a very harsh grader of people meaning you're either obviously in or I put you in the two hard to tell bucket and I just lump you in with all the obvious Nos and that was a non-obvious Insight from Warren Buffett that's a very uh there are freaks like uh Peter teal or Marcus Zuckerberg who who kind of nailed that harshness early on and then there's normal people like me and I'm sure you are like this where yeah you find like a your 22-year-old and like I don't know maybe they're promising maybe they were nervous at that interview maybe they were this maybe they were this and it feels good to give the underdog a shot often times that narrative isn't it doesn't end the way that you like it to end uh like there like the people who that Underdog narrative has work have worked for me it's someone like Steph Smith where let's hypothetically say she didn't do well in the interview but she was so awesome because I saw her blog and I'm like this person's like quirky and interesting said hypothetical there as if anyone's gonna believe that was a hypothetical well no what I mean is like I think she I don't remember the interview I think she did great but like I was into her because I just read her like because I read her blog I'm like oh you have some type of it Factor now maybe I wasn't sure how that it Factor could be deployed or used to my benefit or whether it's like like if it was going to be used like if she was actually gonna like just become the best at like blogging or if she was gonna become a best the best business woman I'm not sure but there was some type of like kernel of like fire there was a fire where I'm like I don't know how I'm G to harness it can you harness whatever but there was something there whereas I've hired a lot of people who who did they didn't exactly have that they didn't have a fire there but I was like maybe it's there and I make these stupid decis ision and it doesn't work because you want to be a good person or whatever and it it doesn't work what what's that phrase no good deed goes unpunished that's how it felt with a lot of with a lot of my hiring decisions yeah you don't want to face the confrontation of it you don't want to admit that you were wrong you don't want to go back to square one and try to find somebody again um you don't want to admit to your team that you were wrong on this there's a whole bunch of very understandable reasons why we make this mistake did I tell you how much of trouble a lot of the ended up being may like a lot of the maybe people ended up being like eh like it was they were I don't know was just eh in the end yeah yeah it always be an a always stayed an a um all right sorry what were you saying I got a lot of trouble at twitch because when I was there I tweeted out something that was very true for me and I think it's true but the COO and others didn't like it I said um something to the effect of you always know in the first two weeks if someone's going to be great great people are great right off the bat they show you greatness in the first two or three weeks I've never seen or you know rarely ever will you ever see somebody who turns out to be great that just was eh in the first two three weeks and they yelled at you yeah they were like that's not I mean different people start at different pace paces and that you know that's not uh basically they were kind of they took it as almost like that's too harsh and somehow it was like seen as like not diverse like oh there's a group of people who are slower to acclimate and our coo responded to the tweet it was like I do not uh like you know stand by this in fact I've blah blah blah since then I've seen a bunch of other people say the exact same thing bunch of other like you know successful people say say the same thing so it kind of in some ways validated this like opinion I had this firstand experience I had which was that the great people show greatness very early on first two weeks I tend to know if this person Gonna Be A Winner now that doesn't mean that somebody can't be a solid contributor that had a slow first couple weeks but they're never the ones who are great and great is all I'm really looking for right the Warren Buffett be a harsh grader that is some of the best advice you could get how do you spell because that would be your reply to them just a fart noise just like when they reply to you like you're not supposed to do that it's like come on no I just said my point exactly and then they were like what that's a ridiculous thing to think because the company was probably founded on that principle partic I don't know EMT but I've seen his interviews he seems like a particular like pretty hardcore at for sure I imagine he was like that early on and so that company was probably founded with that principle in mind we have this all the time in and my my my team uh so Ben who's my business partner we uh we will have some interaction with somebody and he'll be like so what do you think of how that's going with that person like maybe it's a company we invested in and then we like talked to the CEO and they were like uh I don't really know exactly kind of why like they've been really slow to take action or they were saying all kinds of weird stuff that didn't make any sense or we hire somebody Junior and then he's like how's it going with what's so and so so far it's like dude if you have to ask you know right like that's the first first principles if you have to ask you know and I'm and I'll say something pretty harsh like well I don't know we talked about doing these three things and then those three things haven't happened and there's been no update on them in in a week so I don't know how do you think it's going Ben and he's like uh yeah and he'll usually say something because Ben the one of the great things about Ben is Ben has generous interpretation of almost everybody uh like his wife will yell at him and he' be like I mean maybe I could have been a little more present right that's his first reaction you know most people get to that you know but their first reaction is you know some well you that's unfair that doesn't make any sense you did this blah blah blah right people are get defensive whatever he doesn't really do that he doesn't blame he gives a generous interpretation of people which is why I think everybody loves Ben but at the same time in a company like it's a really harsh hard way to run a company because sometimes like Ben like so do you think we should be making excuses for like do you think like great people just like have all these excuses and reasons why they're not just like being great right now or are they just great in spite of circumstances it's like obviously great people are great in spite of circumstances versus great people are bogged down in the 10 maybe reasons why they're struggling right now and um and so I'm definitely but but that attitude that has served me in the workplace doesn't serve me outside of the workplace because you know uh having a generous interpretation for people outside of work is a really awesome trade as a leader in a company it tends to actually um not work so well in the same way that democracy is great democracy inside a company where everybody gets a vote on what we're doing is not a great way to build a company like companies are benevolent dictatorships when they win and you have to be comfortable being a benevolent dictator there but Ben dictator might not work in other areas of your life yeah and and that's why a lot of the most successful people are [ __ ] [ __ ] it's because you have to be the four times divorced or whatever right yeah it's because what makes you great at one thing can make you shitty on another thing all right I enjoyed that conversation is that the pod that's the pod that's the [Music] Pod Sam how many diapers you changing per day right now personally with your dpd yeah for the up until recently it was here comes a live by the way at least one a day divide by two now it's one every three days every three days wow that is pretty incredible well we have a nanny how how happy are you with a nanny very you know a nanny tends to be a nanny for the whole family so like she does our laundry she'll Cooks a little bit she'll clean I usually work at the kitchen table with headphones in and so I'm always present like every 30 minutes I take my headphones out and I go and play so the nanny my my goal was to make sure my child does not have a Jamaican accent you threw a curveball in at the end there what but your goal was for your kid to not have a Jamaican accent like I didn't want someone else to do all of the raising of my child you know what I mean oh you did a copyrighting move there that was nice I like that yeah so if my kids if Naomi ever says jaman I'm going to be like [ __ ] I need to be involved yeah I've been I'm working too hard [Music]

so the story of this business is that it was started by a father and son Duo the father's name is Rey the son is Zach the father he basically managed C dealerships for years and he was like oh there's like I know the ins and outs and his son I think was 24 or 25 at the time and his son always wanted to start an internet business and he also liked YouTube and he was like Hey Dad what if I just asked you some questions on YouTube about like you know how you properly negotiate at the car dealership or how much profit car dealerships make so we know better what to ask for you know things like that love it gonna work yeah and within I think something like eight weeks they got 13,000 followers on this YouTube page and they were like you know we were going to buy all these fancy cameras but then we just got like our iPhone and made it kind of janky and it just people kind of liked it and it was during the pandemic so people were watching a lot of that stuff and so they parlay that into starting a business called car Edge and so if you go to car edge.com what's it say do you see the headline uh yeah it says your personal car Shopper is here no hassle always fair prices so basically they will help you buy a car so the way it works is there's this thing called an Auto Broker or a car broker I think you got your car now from a friend of ours who's a car broker the industry is typically like Mom and popop and a lot of times if you Google like car broker New York City you're going to go to like kind of a mom and pop website and you get on the phone or send an email to this person you tell them what type of car you want and they have relationship with tons of dealers they know they know the ins and outs of the car business you pay them a fee $500 to $2,000 and they typically will go and buy the car for you but the savings that you get on the price of the car is typically better than the fee that you pay them and so it's no big deal and they do all the negotiating for you so it's not uncomfortable for you whatever cool what these guys did is they took like kind of a start upy internet Vibe and they created a nice website for it where you go to their website and they you could you could search different cars that will rather they have a variety of products so like one they have got this thing it's I think it's like 80 bucks a month or 50 bucks a month and they will just like give you tons of information like a database on what the profit margin is on different cars so you can go negotiate s or you can spend $1,000 and tell them the car that you want and they go and buy it for you and they'll even organize it so it gets shipped to you and they do all the organization and all that work and if you don't save at least $1,000 you just get your money back and they built this massive business because if you go to their YouTube page I think they now have 600,000 subscribers on their page and it's this really cute dynamic between a father and son all the pictures on the site by the way are like the dad giving the son a noie it's like just a just wholesome just so wholesome and that father and son like Dynamic for the brand it makes you like them a lot and there were like you know there were a bunch of car podcasts but we basically what they described what they wanted to do is they probably have no idea who we are but it's what you and I do just kind of like riffin a little bit less professional you're the father I would assume am I you're older than me you be thead you know how there was this big viral thing where it was like um you know PewDiePie versus T Series like who can have the most subscribers on YouTube yeah so these guys currently have 533,000 subscribers your boys have 529,000 we are 4,000 subscribers behind car Edge I'm just going to leave that there for our loyal Army who doesn't want to see us lose to this father-son car buying Duo go to YouTube and subscribe all right yeah back to they uh this business is now doing so he he has a a video where he breaks down the revenue so he pulls up their QuickBooks and you can see it but he blurs out the numbers and I messaged him and I was like hey uh I have this thing this podcast like and he goes yeah you know I've heard of it I go just can you tell me the numbers and I could talk about it and he and and so he did and so this business is now doing roughly $10 million a year in Revenue I think it's only two years old or so and it seems like a great business these things could be really cool I think honestly I thought it'd be almost bigger because looking at the traffic they get almost like two million visitors a month to their site and so that is a huge amount of traffic to your website for this thing so I am I'm extremely impressed this is only two years old is yeah it could it could be three but yeah something like that is this something you normally do when you buy cars you use Car Brokers I haven't but I've heard of them we actually talked about it years ago of of people who you know we brought this up in one of the early episodes I've never actually used it but I remember last time I bought my car I was in the dealership for like 4 hours like signing paperwork wiring the money it took forever and I was like I'm never doing this again and so I just started Googling Car Brokers I was like I want to try one and that's how I found these guys and were they YouTube first so it was an audience first yeah YouTube first did they even plan to launch this as a service or did it start as just let's make a YouTube channel the kid Zach has a Blog where he's been blogging since he was 22 and he previously he ran some small information business that was doing like 150,000 in revenue and it's cool you could see him blogging as he goes and he's like I've always wanted to learn how to make money on the internet and start an Internet company and so you could see like he had like two or three businesses that weren't huge or anything but it was very promising for a 21y old and I have a feeling I kind of like clicked their LinkedIn and looked around I think the mother passed away from cancer and so I think there was like a a feeling of like Zack the kid was like you know I want to be with my father more let's see if we can do something together he's got cool blog post so you getting your first customers is really hard and he talks about getting their early customers for this and then another one is from 10 to 14,000 subscribers in three weeks here's what we learned here's what happened and here's what I learned and then I haven't read these yet but I'm just looking at the titles these are cool I'm G to check these out yeah this is a cool kit I think now I think he's only 25 I think I think he's young um and it's just a really promising business and on some of the blog posts he talks about how he's like now I have to project Financial so we can decide when to hire people and so you're actually seeing him do this in real time but he's not in you and I's world and so it's a really fun business to pay attention to and see what this guy uh what what is he going to build isn't how cool is this father-son businesses like um or just like you know parent kid but in not in a uh succession you know hand me down type of way so a couple examples of this we had Al Don come on and talk about Missouri Star the the the biggest quilting store on the internet and it's Al and his mom and he's like you know alen I think his name her name is Debbie I don't know he's like yeah like same thing YouTube channel where she makes content and she's the star and Al was the like cool I'll figure out the internet and like e-commerce part of this and let's make this a thing and this is a ninef fig business that sells quilt supplies to other moms across the the country it's amazing and it's Allan's mom that do that that business together or and Al does a thing that I love when he refers to his mother he doesn't say my mom he goes I was just hanging out and mom wanted to like Quil you know like when they when they use mom as like as a proper noun I love I'm like whenever I hear someone do that that like when they just refer to them as mom not my mom yeah Jen Jenny so it's Al and and Jenny they basically created and she and her YouTube videos are great by the way I've like randomly watched even though I have no I have no interest in quilting but I'm interested in her videos because she's so wholesome and she's so good on camera so I think that's a great example we had the the guys from Farm con and awag say same thing father and son doing business together but not in a um Legacy you know you could take over my business but they started new businesses together and I just think that's so cool you know if my kids want to do something like that that'll be a blast all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you said a couple interesting things so let's let's break this down we have no money we're bootstrapping let's get ourselves on GLG as experts I'm like okay my my charge is $500 an hour she goes no problem but we talked to like someone after a few weeks and he goes do you guys have research and we we looked at each other we're like yeah yeah we have a report it's $5,000 so I was joke that was ampush as Angels round we raised $150,000 selling research reports to hedge fun people that's pretty sick that's an amazing story and by the way there's eight of them that all have like high eight or low nine figures in the whole category has just crushed the two takeaways from this by the way are sell to the rich and then your way of figuring out what they need [Music] was Jesse what up dude how are you doing man what's up guys I'm pumped to be on here good to see you uh where should we start you sent us a doc had a bunch of cool ideas on it which one do you want to start with yeah I mean maybe maybe some of the stuff we've learned at Gateway X as we've been building new ideas I think the idea I'm most excited about which I think Sean you and I have talked about is aux insights Sam do you know about this business no what is Ox insights oh dude this is sick okay tell us about this business You're Gonna Love It Sam so you know one of the things I I as we've learned starting new businesses and some of them you guys probably know like Kahani Sean you were a customer of it it failed it didn't or we stopped doing it and one thing I've learned sitting in the seat is it's really important to like understand demand and that there's a customer who has a problem that you need and then go like stand up the thing with growth assistance that's what I did I already knew people needed it I just stood it up and immediately started to work and so you know I started my career in finance in Consulting I went to pen I got a million friends who are in private equity and after we sold ampush I would get a call from one friend once a month without fail who worked at Blackstone or worked at tpg or worked at one of these fancy private Equity firms and they'd go hey I um I have this deal in front of my investment committee it's a billion company and I'm getting asked all these questions about their Google and Facebook ads Jesse like what if they don't perform well or how do we know they're good at them and they're asking me to like look at the web traffic and make some analysis Jesse I have no idea and my my investment Comm is not happy because I can't convince them to buy this business what should I ask them so the first few calls I'm like well the same thing you any of us would do well go look at the Google analytics well how many how many creatives are they testing my fourth guy was like dude can you just do this for me and I'm like you know me I'm like well yeah couple hundred thousand dollars I'll do it for you and he's like oh that's it yeah done let's go do this and so Ox insights is essentially a private Equity Consulting business it works for private Equity firms specifically in office of the CMO marketing related diligence and what what's called value Creations value Creations after they buy the business they want you to spend time helping them put together a strategy for how they grow the business and there's businesses like accordians a cool example 300 million Revenue 100 million ebit dot it's only a 12-year-old company they do the same exact business for office of the CFO what so anything Finance related yeah accordion I mean you can look at lek is 800 million and 250 in EIT uh McKenzie has an over billion dollar business just for private Equity firms that's got 55% ebit down margins and when you say they're office the CFO so let's let's break this down so you said a couple interesting things the first was it's a lot easier to Succeed in Business If you first find the starving crowd so find the really hungry Market versus how you and I Sam like started at least I should just speak for myself I don't know if you did the same thing but like I would always be like what's a cool idea or what's something I could make or what's something that seems easy to do and it was easy at the start because it's so familiar or it's like just nearby but I have no idea the demand or the demand is all in other broke people like me so it's going to be really hard to sell and make money or I need so many customers to make money whereas you're like well let me work backwards who are the richest people and richest companies it's like private Equity hedge funds that type of customer they're not price sensitive at all urgent and they're super rational they're like cool if I can buy something for $100,000 but it's going to help me make a $10 million decision great uh you know the math maths I'm in so they're they're they're wealthy they're not as price sensitive they're rational and in your case you figured out what the need was because you had one fortunate circumstance which was like they were calling you to ask you about this thing and you basically so so what you built was like a marketing due diligence so they're looking at a company they need to know is there are there digital ads performing very well not so good is there any red flags in here any concerns in the same way that if I want to go buy a company and I get a bunch of financial statements I might ask a super financially lit to go look at it yeah yeah like hey my account like can you look at this can we do a quality of earnings can we get can we get some understanding of like are these numbers solid or not they are really financially literate but they're not as Facebook ads and Google ads and Pinterest ads literate as you are so you're providing that diligence and then after they buy then you're like cool and then we'll help you like lever we'll show you some levers that might be able to grow this this thing after you buy to create the value right you should get background so you started and sold ampush for some tens of millions I think dollars digital marketing agency and then with that money you went and started Gateway X which is almost an incubator yeah we call it a studio me told Co where you have started three or four or five businesses we started six we've shut down two one is kind of going sideways two have crushed it aux being one of them and one is new got it okay and and let me jump in and say two things we what we call it at Gateway X and the studio Sean is we have to have a unique insight and an unfair Advantage I want to build like in 10 years I want this like holdco Studio thing where we've got five to 15 I don't care what the number is operating companies they're all profitable they're compounding on top of each other and we've got this super cool culture of Builders basically inside of it you don't raise money at the start for them right we don't raise money we tried it with Kahani as you know and and it didn't work like it wasn't it just wasn't for me I shouldn't say it was fine it just wasn't for me what what what's Kahani well it's was a great example of Shan's point of like a cool idea so that you're going to think the idea is cool the second I tell you in in like a shitty idea business I was like look e-commerce sites look like they're 10 years old and meanwhile Instagram and Tik Tok have got these like full vertical videos so let's make a plugin to let e-commerce companies change themselves to look more like Tik Tok and Instagram so the first product was the little stories nav bar at the top of of every e-commerce site and we had it on Sean's site and I was like oh it's going to people are going to engage with it the content's going to look bigger it's going to and we launched it and everybody people thought it was a really cool idea right but nobody actually by the way I I thought it was an awesome idea in fact I kind of still think it's an awesome idea a good idea but it doesn't solve anybody's problems and nobody's nobody's lining up for it and then we're like oh it's improving your conversion but then it's like well it's not not sure it's improving our conversion it kind of seems like people engage with it and then people are like it's kind of slowing my site down or takes me too much content and they just ripped it off the site was it basically just a plugin it's a it's a plugin just a plugin so I mean we had a big vision for it right You' have landing pages and you could put your influencers I we I still think someone's going to figure it out but I sat there and I was like I got this other business growth assistant and here's a funny story you guys will like this we go to shop talk and you know shop talk matches you and I have one sales guy from Kahani and one sales guy from growth assistant and they both do the matching thing the Kahani guy gets three meetings the growth assistant guy gets 25 meetings one selling like marketing talent in the Philippines and I go man if there's ever a signal for like solving a problem versus you know just a cool thing this is it and that was like one of the key decisions where I was like I don't want to do this anymore and with Ox so so with Kahani he's like yo you want to invest would love to have you boarded here's a deck and I'm like looking at it I'm like I kind of like the idea but I'm not fully sold so I ended up not investing with Ox he half tells me the idea a text message and I'm like I got to invest in this somehow right like even I was like instantly I was like this shit's going to work this is a great idea much easier to solve and one really cool thing I I had heard Jess talk about this which is earlier when you were doing ampush you signed up for GLG which is a like expert Network where where basically Rich dudes on Wall Street will call you and be like hey nerd you know a lot about this biotech thing or you know a lot about newsletters it's like uh if a banker is about to take a company public like a email software company public they want to talk to all types of users of email software and ask them questions so they could have more conviction in their decision yes and by the way there's eight of them that all have like High eight or low n figures in eitaa to be clear there's guid Point Global there's Alpha sites the whole category has just crushed and it's basically like if Brad Pit called you and was like Hey you ever been to this Italian restaurant in New York he's going to take a supermodel there but you've been there and he's like how's the parm and you're like that's pretty good actually and then they're like cool they hang up you don't know why they asked you and they pay you $1,000 dollar for the for the for the feedback well here's the this the story of GG is hilarious so I don't usually tell this part of the story but it starts earlier young Jess's an associate at Goldman Sachs he decides my best friend who's my co-founder's hedge fund blew up during the financial crisis so he doesn't have a job so he kind of sits around he's like I don't want to get a job Jesse I want to start something he gets me excited enough that I'm like all right I want to start something too let's go start something in a few months I give my notice at Goldman they're like take 90 days wind down and I was like me I'm like hey do you mind if I use the firm's resources to research my future business idea and Goldman by the way probably has a multi-million dollar subscription with GLG so we have an unlimited calls they don't charge us per call because at Goldman they're paying them so much money so me and my co-founder line up three phone calls a week with like digital ad experts and Lead gen people and we research e-commerce like you name the category we were talking to an expert in it for like the 90 days before we left before I left Goldman we also had all the saleside analysts come and tell us like what are the internet trends that we should be paying attention to so this was the research before ampush started I'm 24 25 years old then I start ampush Quinn Street which you guys may or may not know is a publicly traded lead gen business goes public and the same thing happens a couple of my hedge fund friends call me and go dude isn't this what you're doing like and I go well here's what you need to look at and here's how their margins work and then I get the idea I'm like we have no money we're bootstrapping let's get ourselves on GLG as expert so I call my old rep and I go hey can I be an expert on G on your GG are they asking they go yeah we need someone I'm like okay my my charge is $500 an hour she goes no problem so now me and my co-founder are doing on the other side of the marketplace we're doing five calls a week we're making 25 you know it's good money but we talked to like someone after a few weeks and he goes do you guys have research that you can put together because you can the way you're explaining is so helpful and we look at each other we're like yeah yeah we have a report it's $5,000 I'll send you guys a report you can link to it it's super outdated at this point it's a 50-page report it's gonna explain the lead genen industry to you tell you who the competitors are blah blah blah blah blah he's like yeah I'll take it so we' we basically spend four days all weekend putting this report together and then GG is like Hey we're getting a lot of other questions this report can you sell more of it by the time it was all said and done we sold 30 of the reports so I was joke that was ambush's Angels around we ra raised $150,000 selling research reports to hedge fund people that's insane all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guy so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show I don't know if you heard on the Pod but Anand from CB insights did the same thing did you hear did you hear his story he basically no sold he's smarter he turned it into a huge business well he started with the with the PDF and he's like you know he's trying to charge like $500 and then he's like the best thing that ever happened to us was my buddy was like no no no you need to charge like $112,000 minimum 25,000 as your medium and then have a $100,000 option he's like dude it's a PDF like are you sure that's what they did and they made like 300 Grand that year it's a giing good yeah right he gets more value when people think it's uh it's more expensive I mean that's for pricing for aux we charge $50,000 a week for for a team of consultants and McKenzie Bane and BCG charge $200,000 a week so our argument is we're 75% cheaper than them but way better in our world of online Market you know the world that we know extremely well how come you don't charge 75% more and say we're better that well so one of the things I didn't tell you when when I my friends were calling me and I was like isn't there someone who does this why are you keep calling me about this and what they told us this was part of the market research was they said look McKenzie Bane and BCG are $200,000 a week and they don't they're not practitioners of marketing Jesse so they don't actually know the answers and then every time we ask an agency agencies come back with recommendations like change your match types or do more lookalike audience or whatever and they're like we don't know what the [ __ ] they're talking about like we don't understand what they're saying what they want is you do this and this much revenue neita will come so a big part of our work is literally just translating marketing levers into Revenue nebit terms so that they can actually understand what they're what they're going to spend money on or what the risk levers are in the business do you run like fake ads like um like you know a lot of people when they have a company they'll be like you know we want to make this product but we're not actually sure if anyone's going to buy it and so they make an ad for the product that doesn't exist and sometimes the landing page will be like oh you caught us a little bit too soon but let us know uh if you want this whatever we've done it in value creation we haven't done it in diligence diligence is like you've got four weeks they're trying to discern whether they want to buy the business and you're just like you're head you have so much data you have to figure out what's going on and be able to give them a smart answer value creation you have 12 or 20 weeks sometimes depending on the engagement there we will definitely run experiments we'll make ad changes we'll do all these things and come back to them and say hey this is a good idea this is not a good idea so to make this actionable like even for me or Sean or listener what do you look for like what can I look for in my business and I assume obviously this is only if you are running digital ads Facebook and Google basically ads what can you look for to be like there's opportunity here or this is stupid shut it down yeah I mean we we approach it in a few different ways right one is top down like we use veros and a couple other thirdparty data sources and our own data to figure out benchmarks of the company so if you're an e-commerce business with a you're selling water bottles what should your click-through rate what should your conversion rate by Channel what that's our top down way of kind of assessing where they stand and so that's just whatever you can get that data anywhere online and then the bottom up part of it is for example for Facebook right we'll say like is the account structured correctly often times there's too many ads trying like breaking the signal in too many different places and it needs to be Consolidated the other question we'll ask is is their event match quality good oftentimes these old old school companies owned by private Equity they don't even they have like a three out of 10 match quality which means Facebook's signal is super crappy for them and I bet Sean's company and most startups have nine out of 10 because they've like made sure Facebook's getting all the right data then there's all the creative stuff are they you know the easiest thing someone says my performance is bad I'm go how many creative test a week a week what are you talking about oh we do two a month well yeah of course your performance is going to be horrible right so creative testing is one of the easiest levers to pull in terms of improving faceb and if a business that you're looking to buy has all these things that they're doing wrong and they're still succeeding and you for you you're like there's opportunity here if they get this right you're going to be even better after buying this exactly and size right so the key deliverable the first five sides of every deck are here's the grade for every channel and then here's the waterfall that says what's your carita and then if you improve the things that we think in a pretty moderate way here's what your ebit do the business could be and that's the money chart for a private Equity guy that's pretty sick yeah it's it's a super cool business and and honestly like the validation that we've gotten like that's the other cool thing is my one of my other tests for a business is if in my Discovery phase people start asking me to buy it I know I'm on to like that's what happened with growth assistant that that's what happened with aux in early days I've ampush that happened I was like hey this is an idea we have we want to get you offshore marketing people like can I get one of those people and I'm like oh okay we're good same thing with a private Equity I call some of my buddies I go here's this idea we have we want to do he's like oh I actually have a deal right now can you guys start looking at it that's awesome how big is this business now is it a year old could you say like it's like five million it'll do five million this year dude that's insane yeah it'll do five million and we by the way we invested one tenth of what we put into Kahani into it and by the way Sam like I think the the key because you were like what are the marketing levers and like he gave you like a as good as answer you give not having like the thing you need it's like doctor what can I do to be better here's none of my data none of my scans none of my it's like well you should I guess you know check on your health so the key here with this business though is it's he won't say this it's not part of a sales pitch but like it's not that he has to be like this marketing Savant that's going to like find the genius levers these companies are really buying certainty and it's it's cya right it's why a lot of consultants get hired in the world is is there's a c component you're doing a deal you need to understand that the thing you're buying doesn't have any like you know hor horrible warts that's the first piece and then cool what is a like best case Bas case worst case kind of scenario of what we can do to grow this thing and it's not even like a specific tactic like oh change the audience segmentation but it's like we need a plan made by people who know a lot about this and that's enough to like kind of move the ball forward and then of course like when you could go in and you actually do the [ __ ] you'll figure it out Case by case like there's not like like you go to a 100 e-commerce companies and you could take the 10 smartest people in Facebook ads and Google ads they're going to give you 10 different answers for every single company because one guy likes cost caps another guy likes ASC another guy says simplify the structure another guy says use all the new [ __ ] you know another guy says do this attribution method another guy says this there's no real uniform answer for like how do you do how does this work better versus worse yeah well I'll I'll disagree like I'll show you can I share my screen yeah yeah I mean this is an example of the internal tool or the internal like analysis to give you the detailed answer Sam of like everything we look at when we're trying to assass and grade inside of a private Equity right so there it's top down it's bottom up how much spend is getting spend Place what's campaign structure what's how fast you made this I mean my my team made this yeah that's so cool um so this is what we go through and do and we're gonna turn this into software at some point by the way any colorcoded Excel sheet we like ah this is [ __ ] great I remember Steph Smith came on and showed me like a just like a beautifully formatted Excel sheet I don't think I even read anything that was in it but I was like you're great this is fantastic like I'm such a sucker for formatting on an Excel sheet well but and Sean's right which is like the other thing I would think about too that I think a lot of entrepreneurs Miss because we we're so caught up on ourselves is the humanness on the other side of the table so [ __ ] you say private Equity Firm and you're like oh yeah private Equity Firm but what's really happening is there's a there's a mid-level partner if they buy a business and Facebook blows up in a year on them it's career limiting for them right so the human being on the other side wants to go in and sell this deal to their committee be able to put a good good case together and the reason McKenzie and Bane both built billion dollar businesses doing this is because those people wanted to go look McKenzie says the market is big now the the dream is they go look Ox says there's x amount of ebit available in marketing and look at the analysis they put together that's convincing of that what percentage of the deals do say it's [ __ ] you're like no dude like there's no opportunity here we've had I mean it's it's a young business we've only done 20 projects but let's say in 25% we've said we we should you should stay the hell away from one I mean one there was just straight up in the SEO backlinking that they would have never spotted without us that was a huge win and I mean they paid us obviously they didn't do the deal and then we've had a couple where we were not convinced that there was as much leverage like the management team puts together projections right so they they share projections in these things and we look at those projections and we basically go dude this person would have to be the best Facebook ad marketer on the planet to hit these projections like we we think they can grow but we don't think the projections they put together are reasonable we need to double click and as they double clicked on that they lost about the deal wow what a cool business good job thank you much better than Kahani so you're thing was like kind of office for the CMO you talked about how accordion and there's there's the equivalent for the CFO side can you talk about other businesses that are like this that sell to the like Ultra Rich customers so let's call it hedge funds investment Banks whatever I heard you talk about a business that I had never heard of called I think it was first ring or first Rain r what is that that sounded very interesting well the first thing I was tell people to go like who's the richest man in New York Sam who's the richest man in New York I don't want to ruin your story I'll who's the richest man in New York do you think long here's the homie guess here the homie guess a hedge fun guy some real estate guy yeah Daniel o or Steve schwarzman or whatever nope nope nope it's Michael Bloomberg it's the guy who's selling information and so sitting at Goldman I like had this terminal we were paying $1,200 a month for and you know they never negotiate price every single terminal they never do volume discounts and you're like damn this guy's just I mean they're printing money in that business it also helps that he owns the entire thing owns the entire thing but dude whether he did or didn't it the thing makes like five 10 billion a year and but uh it's huge it's a ridiculous business right and so I'm sitting there I'm an entrepreneurial person and and my boss comes up to me and she goes you got to set up first rign Jesse and I'm like oh cool what's first rain and I'm like looking through it and it's like pull the stock ticker and get an alert to your inbox when there's news about this company and I'm like this is just Google Alerts she's like what's Google Alerts and and I'm like what do we pay a month for this she's like oh we pay like $2,000 per license and I'm like well our group is like 40 people like we're paying $80,000 no no we got a discount it's $50,000 a month we're paying for for this Google analytics thing I'm like what the [ __ ] and so you know one of the one of the categories for us now and again remember unfair Advantage is very important I I happen to have a lot L of friends in this world because of where I went to college just whatever unfair Advantage where'd you go to college I went to Penn fancy the Wall Street you know TR training school so a bunch of my friends work at hedge funds and private equity and you know these guys want information like that they're willing to pay tons and tons of money for they're not price sensitive at all they if they can they can the ROI of everything they every decision they may because that was what we got told about first Reign they go oh it's $50,000 a month but if it gets us one trade ahead of somebody else it's paid for itself for the full year so because of the numbers they're dealing in they can just pay anything right just like the $200,000 to to diligence the project for a half a billion dollar deal it's nothing for them right so this category is a great one to sell into and actually I have another funny story you guys will like so on GLG GLG has been like my life my savior in business you what happened for me I became like a regular take that term any way you want for hedge fund dudes for Facebook every quarter 10 same people would call me and they would go how's the quarter going Jesse do you think Spen is going to be up or down because they own huge positions in Facebook right so one of the guys eventually is like Jesse I want access to your data like I just want the AG I'm allowed to share it's my data at ampush I'm spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year and he goes I want I want just full real-time access to your data I go I can give it to you an aggregate I can't give you any client data and he's like but what can I get to you and I was like Well bootstrapped Company right I'm like you know we've been dealing with this like working capital situation with with our bank like will you just give me a $5 million doar interest free loan he's like done he's like done so this guy Peter he's a good friend of mine now he gave us a $5 million loan so we didn't have to pay any interest to our bank to do working capital and all I had to do was basically gave him a realtime feed from our Tableau or whatever our aggregate CPM CTR whatever all of our data for for Facebook so anyway first Reign is is a basic software tool you sell the hedphones because they're willing to pay anything for it and so one of my ideas by the way and if anyone's listening wants to build this with me I need someone very good at analytics and and decent at sales is I just in my network I could probably get five billion in in meta Facebook spend of and give people a survey every quarter did you spend more or less how excited are you get like a detailed survey it' have to be a really robust survey then I'd go to all these hedge fund people and I'd say you can have access to this data every quarter it's a it's $50,000 a quarter and you have to guarantee me two years of a subscription and I think I'd have people align out the door people willing to pay for that data and then I would do it for Google then I would do it for Amazon then I would do it for all of these different platforms D dude even easier we uh like why not just go to Triple well who already has all the data yeah and be like hey triple well let's uh you know do this line of business basically 100% yeah let me license your data for the exclusive use in the financial service that's not going to be important for them and then you can basically create a thing that hedphones would pay for and the best thing you what I would do to hedge Fones I'd say I'm only going to sell it to 20 of you but let's do a reverse auction so now make them bid against each other for this data and as long as you limit it they'll do that because they don't want everyone having the data right that's a really important thing to them but anyway the the the lesson here is that category alternative assets are a great thing to bootstrap into because they like one deal basically can make you as a business and then you can go from there yeah my my old uh business partner used to call it just adding a zero he's like basically what what Market or product can we go into where we do the same exact work but we just add a zero to the end of the the dollar amount that we're able to charge like Sam you you told me this with your events too you used to charge I think like $300 a ticket but then other people charge 3,000 and then I forgot who it was like recode or whoever it was charged $30,000 a ticket and it was like the same work same product it was ridiculous and I did the exact same thing Sean that you said you did where you're like I have an idea but I'm broke so I'm just gonna assume that everyone else is broke go hang out with other broke people doing the easy thing with like the two takeaways from this by the way are sell to the rich you know you're going to be able to add a zero to to what you're what you're doing and then your way of figuring out what they need was you had friends in that Circle you could go make friends or you were using GG you were like I have one area of expertise that could be my calling card to get in the door and then that will be how I you know understand what these people need and then maybe I can pair what I know with what they need and to a you know either a data product or a Consulting product yeah and to tie it tie them together actually anyone listening I would say what is it that you know extremely well or a couple things that are across sections of each other and so first figure that out and then figure out who's willing to pay you the most money for what you know that's essentially what I did with with Ox business I was like I know this thing who's gonna go pay me the most for it and that group is gonna pay me the most by far can I you didn't put on this sheet but I want to talk I want to ask you a couple questions about this particularly because I don't know if Shawn knows much about this company and I know a little bit about it but I know that what I know they're like crazy impressive so I think you sold your company to Red Ventures is that right so we s it's a longer story we sold a minority they wanted to buy the whole thing we couldn't get to terms we sold a minority we gave them an option to buy the rest of the business they started buying content assets and decided not to buy the rest of our business so we ended up eventually selling it to someone else but we did for basic got to know them for two years we operated as one company because the plan was originally for them to buy so I know them and Rick incredibly well do you know about this company Sean Red Ventures I know about the surface level and actually we've we've hit up Jesse being like dude this is fascinating should we get Rick on like and I would I want to know more well but there's one part of the story that I just want to mention which was amazing is like he started this thing and then he was actually on the plane uh that Su landed in the in the Hudson and he like gave this like amazing talk when he he was like I was like one or two years into my business and for some reason that life and death that life or death situation kind of changed his outlook on life and now Red Ventures is known as like one of the best places to work and it sounds like they're it's a great company so yeah what's the background yeah so the story the way that they tell it they started the business in 2000 so Rick and Dan are the founders and they're both friends and both multi-billionaires and they they actually met at cendant in the late 90s you guys know what sendin is they had like the the coupon book they launched orbits they were like the original internet hold Co they met there very direct marketing heavy so in 2000 the two of them broke off on their own literally months before the internet imploded they started uh red f is what it was first called five years later in their their story their telling of it not mine Rick says dan give me a dollar Dan gives him a dollar he goes you can have my half of the business I hate this business I don't want to do it so they do a hard reset five years in I think they barely were doing a million ebit du and like these guys are the best Learners you've ever met so then at the time go back 2005 there was this new thing called Google AdWords and there was agency starting and there were leg gen businesses and they for whatever reason they had a relationship with Direct TV they said hey D Direct TV if you remember back then was looking for satellite people to sell in the mall like these resell so Rick or one of them had this idea of let's go to go go to Direct TV and become a dealer so they go hey direct you want to be a dealer go sure we love dealers what's your territory they go oh this new thing called the internet will be our territory they go okay sure we don't know anything so they became direct Star TV authorized dealer of Direct TV but as a part of their thing they owned all the web rights they owned all the AdWords rights they owned all the SEO and in four years they built a $75 million bit. business just selling Direct TV subscriptions because they would run the media take the phone calls and all these things that are commonplace today where like what you do on your website gets cookie and then you know on the phone call they were they were pioneers and all of that stuff and basically if if someone became a reseller of the TV tech uh Dish Network or whatever it was direct TV they gave Red Ventures like, $500 Bounty for every single customer they get and Red Ventures just had to do it for less than that right and so between their media and of course after a few years DirectTV is like well we can't get rid of you because you're driving all of our customers but we don't like the deal we made so then they renegotiated a million different times and I you know they still probably work with them but then they went and took that out and then General Atlantic the big private Equity Firm invested and has crushed it on that deal and they um they went and did that for any High LTV purchase you can imagine so every credit card company worked with them American Express um Verizon Wireless people who sell Pest Control like anything that was like a long-term purchase basically Red Ventures was either running their marketing and when they invested in us we wanted to do the same deal for direct to Consumer companies which did not work nearly as well as it worked for them which is a different story for a different day but that's what they got to then they got to 2015 they're doing two two 300 in neita and there's no more growth left which is why they invested in us and they bought they did they did a bunch of other things Rick's really smart and he goes okay I'm gonna invest in Jesse he did five other deals at the same time same year and a year later ampush is going okay the other one went down to zero one you know but they bought an SEO business that they Ed their same Playbook and within nine months they took it from three in ebit da to nine in IIT da and they go oh [ __ ] so that worked okay let's go do a bigger deal so then they bought like a $10 million ebit SEO content business and then they took it to like 25 when you say SEO content business you're talking about like uh the Points Guy yeah the first one was reviews.com the second one I'm forgetting the name of it but yeah like the points then they finally RI like he did a couple of those and Rick's like all right I'm ready for the big time he went and bought Bankrate which is a billion dollar public traded company for 100 in ebitda it owns the Points Guy it owns creditcards.com it owns and in less than two years they tripled the ebit da of the business and then they bought Healthline they bought CNET I mean so they basically took their and now the services part of their business is a tiny part of their business and the SEO content part is a massive part of their business but the same culture the same Playbook and it's it's an incredible business incredible so can you explain what they're doing so they buy these SEO businesses which is let's just take bank rate as an example people Google best yep mortgage rate current mortgage rates whatever and they Bankrate has done the content work and the SEO work to be the top thing that shows up on Google so then you click it you go in and they have like these affiliate offers and that's all great and what what red did was they basically am I right that they bought a business that was like primarily SEO driven and then they layered on paid to that is that the main thing that they did or what what did they do to the assets there's four major levers they pull and the first thing I have to tell whenever I tell the story is Rick and it's the most unique culture like at some point you guys I just take you there and you got to tour the campus and check it out because you've never seen anything like it and there's a great New York time article where they describe it as like part Wall Street trading desk part like Southern politeness and part like hardnose direct response marketing and that's exact like is a very AP description but anyway well and that's why I wanted to ask you about it because Rick seems like an anomaly like he seems like a like a like this is normally like kind of a not this could be a shady industry it often is a shady industry he does seem like a shady guy and they seems like like people love working there which is rare he's one of the most special people I've ever met in he's one of the most special people in the world I think what would we notice if we toured the campus what would we see it funny you asked that so one of my requests to him when when they invest I want to Shadow your leadership team for a week me and my my 10 leaders are going to Shadow your leaders and I want to see what you guys do and what you'd find is you know these things that are like startup adages they've done at a scale of 5,000 people every meeting is short every meeting starts with a bottom line numbers are the only thing that is ever talked about in levers and every person is basically trying to optimize more ebit and in any discussion they're having and they don't talk about the work that gets done as a independent of that right it's like another example is like they shape teams so and you know for digital marketers they don't say like we have a client team and we have a marketing team we have they go we have like team click-through rate and we have Team conversion rate and we have Team traffic volume like they literally organize people by the kpi that they're trying to drive so that there's a deep deep focus into it they have these really cool things called business reviews where basically Rick and the leadership team sits and you have 20 minutes to come in give an update on your business real decisions are made about the business and he does like 40 of the or like 40 over two days basically so it's a high energy very smart it's like it's a very unique culture but anyway so the culture is a starting point by far because without it I don't think any of this works they have four main levers the first is Improvement of traffic acquisition both paid and organic so to your point Sean they'll they'll layer on paid in a really smart way they think a lot about cost per visitor Revenue per visitor and get that equation working extremely well but they'll do a lot of SEO as well and they'll get volume up right so I think I remember high level when they bought the Points Guy I'm making these numbers up but it was doing 70 cents in Revenue per visit and maybe 40 cents in cost per visit and two years later was doing like a dollar a170 in Revenue per visit and like 90 cents in cost per visit but the visits were up by like a factor of two or something like that right so so first lever is traffic acquisition second lever is they're extremely good at on-site optimization if you guys pull up the Points Guy or any of those things now you'll say wow Platinum American Express is plugged here but it's plugged in a smart way but I want to click on it but it doesn't feel too sales even they're very good at getting basically the on-site optimization to be significantly higher the third lever is they're incredible Geniuses when it comes to pricing to the efficient Frontier of a customer's curve you guys know what I mean when I say that you're using a lot of words my friend dependently but when you put them together that way it was just a combination I wasn't familiar so when you're a credit card so you're American Express right and American Express is probably worth willing to pay $700 per credit card application but their person on their side will pay 200 if they can right so but the only way if you can figure out the exact willingness to pay for an incremental customer by your customer in their business your profits Skyrocket so they basically basically you could call the simple way to say it is they're good at pricing they they can really charge more for what they get and this I'll tell you a funny story the guy who's who's retired now but he's a good friend of mine he's a southern dude he's very like disarming but then he's smart as [ __ ] and he's like Jesse we were 60 days from close we were going to close this bank rate deal and their team told me there was a bided auction for how you bought credit card applications and no technology could beat it and he said I looked at it and I said discovers only paying 500 for an application and they said they're willing to pay 900 why are we not charging them 900 he's like well that's how the algorithm Works he's like buying this deal he goes the day we closed the deal Jesse I threw away that algorithm I pulled up a spreadsheet I called all the customers I said what are you willing to pay what are you willing to pay I got them I charged them exactly what they were willing to pay and I got 20% more in iita over like within within the first month I owned the business and so that's the third lever they're good at and then the fourth lever is they're they're not Crash and Burn people but they're very thoughtful about and when when they invested in ampush I cut the head count under their sort of toage by more than half and our Revenue grew during that time so they're very good at like truly challenging the the bloat in an organization and being like how many people do we actually need like one story you guys will love is one of their Executives said they bought some like government-owned thing it's a really weird business that mails you all the mailers when you move I'm forgetting the name of it right now but I hate that so it's actually was owned by the USPS and then it got now Red Ventures owns it I goes so how did you decide how to reduce the headcount he goes we took the top three managers in the company and we held a draft so we basically put everyone's name on the board and and we said you there's only 40 people of 80 staying now go draft your best people and again they you know they're compassionate with obviously the people they like go it's not that's not it's not meant to be a negative towards them but like these organizations they're very good at leanly Staffing these organizations right so those are the four big levers and that's how they get the kind of results they get that's dope I appreciate the uh the Red Ventures master class that's great they're like a juggernaut that I didn't know much about in terms of how they actually operate your boyfriend uh the guy from Silver Lake the guy you love who's the guy what his name that you have a crush on uh I should probably know his name if he's my boyfriend uh e Egan what his name Egan I think he's on their board yeah he's on their board um ga's on their board and I mean look they they they're all minority holders they've never raised a dollar of primary Capital so they're in my opinion they're a bootstrap giant right they've taken secondary but they've never raised primary they headquarters in like North Carolina or something right yeah they're in Charlotte but again dude Rick is the Hustler of all Hustlers it's right across the border in South Carolina because the state of South Carolina has paid for the whole thing with tax incentives you you have on here every profitable founder should understand PE and rollups what's that mean yeah I think one of the biggest value creation levers if you're running a$ two to5 million ubit business is a rollup and I'll tell the story of the company that ended up buying ampush because it's kind of like still hurts me a little bit when I tell it so there was a business called Elite sem is an sem agency 4 million iita same year that I think ampush had like six or something in 2015 we ended the steal with Red Ventures whatever learned a ton but these guys sold to a business called Mountain Gate capital and let's assume I don't know what they paid but let's assume it was on eight times eitaa which is fair multiple so they paid 32 million for the business right the founders rolled 30% I don't know for a fact but I'm just let's making that up in this scenario Founders roll 30% of the value they take 20 million off the table and they they roll the rest in Mountain Gate goes and another six different businesses in the 1 to two million eitaa range now for those businesses they pay like five four to five times eitaa then they grow the whole thing organically right so then they go for was math four let's say they buy another five or six companies they buy 10 and eitaa right total invested capitals call it 60 ballpark but now the business is worth 15 times correct and it was bought by new Mountain who bought who bought ampush it was bought by new Mountain for 15 times which is 225 million EIT so the founders got 20 million plus then got another bite of called 40 or something like that plus the PE Fromm obviously crushed it on it my push to Founders would be like if you understand that multiples are a function of growth stability and like and margin or defens ability however you want to think about that and all those things improve with scale and so there's just what they call the finance nerds call it multiple Arbitrage which means I can buy at a low multiple and then I can sell in a few years for a higher multiple and I think a lot from if I'm a profitable bootstrap founder including myself like even for growth assistant and other things I'm like this seems like such an obvious path to create a tremendous amount of value that's that's like better than the Venture path for so many different reasons more apt on and more just you know but yeah I think I think everyone should look at it in their space and by the way I think I've been approached multiple times and pitched on this and it's on my list of like creative AI meets rollup so Jesse go let's go buy a creative agency redo their processes with AI right then once figured that out let's go buy 10 more of them and not only will you be able to roll up and get the all this multiple Arbitrage but you will create a much more profitable business so I think there's a lot of strategies out there and I would say like I think a lot you can do with private Equity without private Equity but but the founders of running these businesses should be the ones leading them and the more the founder has the strategy the better they're going to do with the PE firm if they ever need the capital to go do it right you mentioned AI I want to ask you about that because you were early to the social networking wave I think you were doing like a social networking type of thing and the first year Facebook I think there's some story where Zuck called you and uh I called him on his cell phone pretended to be somebody else that was a good one oh you called Zuck uh tell that story by the way who did you pretend to be so summer of ' 05 we're like Facebook's oh my God Mar Mark zucker's a year old he's our age right we're like he's our age he's like gonna crush it but he's never gonna go into High School somebody should start a high school Facebook and we're like why not us so we start the high list I have like I have like the docs we these little I iconography and all this stuff we basically rebuilt clone of Facebook and at the beginning of the summer we went to go by hsf facebook.com and some kid at Columbia I don't even remember his name maybe he's listening and he can he can throw himself he owns it and he goes well I'll sell it to you for like $20,000 and we're college kids we're like no thanks we'll call it the high list and we say peace we build the whole product we launch it literally on the eve of the launch he calls us and he goes Mark Zuckerberg wants to buy HS Facebook so I'm giving you a last chance buddy like you can get it and and I was like oh my God we need and I was like my first question was is he going to launch in high school he's like yeah he says he is and I'm like no are you sure like I think the guy's bullshitting me so I'm like prove it so he forwards me the email from Zuck and this is not this is just a guy named Mark Zucker it's not Zuck Zuck today right and the guy includes a 917 Areo code number sorry Zach that your air code's 917 on your cell phone and I don't know what the rest of it was I don't remember but basically it has a cell phone number so I'm like okay how do we call and how do we verify this is true so I call Zach by the way I call him from summer internship office at Bane Capital so I'm like sitting inside some Finance Company calling him and I go my name is Tom Goldberg I'm partners with this guy Bob and we own HS Facebook together so I want to make sure that you're not like I'm not getting cut out of this deal that you apparently have with him and he goes yeah I'm gonna buy it from him and you need to sort that out with him and then I go well what are you gonna do with it and I kid you not he spends 30 minutes and to his credit he outlines the entire strategy that Facebook has executed he goes first we're going to go to high schools then we're going to go to workplaces then we're going to go into pods then we're going to like he had the whole strategy this is in ' 05 dude this is a year into Facebook and he's like he's like I'm start wearing chains and cool shirts right around he's like 22 or I'm 21 and then he's like wait by the way what was your name again and I'm like click needless to say our high school Facebook plan did not work out they they launched and they crushed us and we went and got jobs at in finance that's an amazing story sad story um and by the way isn't the funny thing that like the actual answer was go join Facebook like just go do whatever every point in my life that has been the right answer to maximize my outcome and when I started ampush dude for 10 years like I was before all their ads and I did the math because a buddy of mine got a job with same resume got like a Corp Dev and he didn't take it I was like he's an idiot but he didn't take it but he we have his offer we have his physical offer still it's like oh that would have been worth $75 million dude I know I talked to a guy the other day who was like the two or three 100th employee of Facebook and he was like I had $100 million in Facebook stock yes you know he worked there for seven years or something like that what I should have done is said hey look I started this High School competitor do you want to hire me dude because I'd probably be like a billionaire right now because it was a year into the business existing and by the way like to start Facebook unbelievable amount of work and and and genius to be the founding kind of like first five 10 15 20 people there tremendous amount of work you're scaling something that's that's massive and you got to be like really sharp or you're going to get washed out to be the H 100th or 200th person at Facebook don't need anything special to be honest all you do around hey get over here can you lift boxes for a bit all right he lifted boxes for a bit hey can you um we got a bunch of spammers can you look at all these and figure out like what we're going to do tell the team like we need people to filter this at by employee 200 you no longer need to be at the top of the genius curve nor my God work you know an incredible amount and you still get rich I four years into ampush I was looking for a head of sales and our best place of higher salesp people was from Facebook itself because they knew how to navigate the Beast and get us more kind of leads from that get this guy we love each other on the first dinner you know he meets two other people on teams and he's four four interviews in and I do the classic talk all right let's talk comp for a second right we're a startup we'll give you a couple points of equity and he like gets this very scared look on his face he goes Jesse I'm investing $800,000 a month in Facebook stock how are you going to match that I'm like I'm like dude what what why good to meet you buddy we'll see you later that is absolutely insane uh Sean have you heard the story about Noah Kagan and how Noah was hired to work at Facebook Noah was the 32nd or 30th employee employee and basically what happened is he uh was out at a party and he was drunk or something like that and he tells a reporter a reporter we're going to launch this thing and that thing and it's going to be the best thing ever and it becomes a news article the next day and Zuck goes to his desk and he goes you're [ __ ] with my company you're out and he fires him on month nine so Noah was three months away from his first vest and Noah told me he goes had I just made it that three months those that those shares today would be worth about $ 100 million those three months all because he kind of had a big mouth when he was W and drunk at a party he was he was ambush's first Facebook ads client believe it or not appsumo was that's awesome I bought his first I got his first customers for him yeah and now it's like you know a business that does 100 million year in Revenue so it kind of worked out but it would have worked out a lot easier if they uh kind of kept his mouth shut yeah you know but my thought I don't know how you guys feel about that I I I've done that math and I'm like but I don't think I could have worked like I don't want to work for someone of course you can't look back and be like but even if I could even now make that decision I'm like I don't think I would have wanted to work for Facebook or anywhere for that that long or like dude I would that would been awesome we gonna say SE I think they're both right so the the math on this just to put it in perspective let's say you join when Facebook is valued at a billion dollars which I think it was like a few like a few years in I don't I don't think it was like right away because at the time it was unclear social networking would be that big and so let's say you join at a billion dollar valuation and you're employee you know 400 and you're so junior you're junior and they give you $10,000 of stock a year you're gonna make a you get a $100,000 salary and you're GNA get 10,000 of stock over four years you you've accumulated $40,000 of stock at a even at a billion today Facebook is a 1.35 trillion dollar company so that's you get thousand bagger multiply by a, $1,300 1300 times your 4,000 it's a $54 million stock option you got for being the janitor at Facebook at the right time which tells me a couple of things number number one picking the right company and project will be like by far picking the right Market to be in the and then the the winner of that market if you're in the tech industry is by far the most impactful thing you could do in your bit in your like career it'll it'll beat your hard work it'll beat your own like you know intelligence it'll beat being right many times in a row like you just got to be right once in that right time and I should point this out which is that at the time or like every kind of like four years it's pretty obvious what like winning companies look like so my version of this was I I only did two job interviews in my life the first one was at Monkey Inferno which was the the studio I ended up joining because I wanted to be in a studio and the other one I did was stripe and I could have told you right then like stripe is the winner like it's the winner of the star the reason that was the only other interview I did was because I was like stripe is the winner it was super obvious and I've done the similar like heartbreaking math of like wow even if I had joined I would have just been like a sales guy B bis Dev guy like I had no like I would no seniority would have made an absolute Fortune now other hand you have the Jesse thing which is like do you want to do it would you would you actually have stuck it out and even beyond that is would you have held because there's no chance that I would have held I bought Bitcoin in 2014 I did not hold all the Bitcoin I gambled four Bitcoin away on a poker night one night because I was just like playing online poker I did all kinds of things that's now a four times $60,000 you know thing at the time Bitcoin was like 300 bucks so it was like I thought a$1 thousand investment it was actually a quarter million dollar investment and you know there the idea that I would have held is ridiculous and I don't think uh I don't think it the math is actually real because nobody holds for that long I agree that's insane I've got the same story by the way with Airbnb I think I was going to be employee 120 or something and I don't know also it was a $20 an hour job I don't even know if the equity would have been a lot but you do the math and it does it does sting a little bit but dude I I mean the one way like I was I worked at Goldman I was 25 my 29-year-old boss made $2 million a year my 35-year-old boss was making $15 million a year and I got off that path because I was like I don't want to like sit here and look at spreadsheets all day like it's a very not Dynamic job I didn't I looked at my boss I said do I want to be them one day and I said no and I literally wrote this down to keep myself honest I said I would I'm okay with like half my personal expected value to be able to like do my own thing in the future I don't I've have never rerun the math but but I had to like make that you know decision for myself what's a $15 million a year employee at Goldman do there's a bunch of jobs that make that kind of money but in my world I was in the like the buy side hedge fund they were investing we had a$7 billion doll fund two in 20 right if the thing delivers 10% a year they make the fees on 7 billion are like what 140 Plus on 10% is 700 million it's like 350 million in carry and there's four senior people now Goldman might even get half of it or whatever but like the they're paying 50% out of whatever people make in the so but then Bankers make that much I mean all these financial services at a seniority level they all they all make tons of money there was a guy who inou a scholarship I got when I was at pen who was a partner at Goldman at the head of the infrastructure fund I was making 55 a year is what he told me and then when he told you did he just like smirk the biggest smirk you've ever seen in your goddamn life and it just could it was permanent he had a faci I saw yeah but you've been there 30 years and like if You' ever been in those atmospheres none of the three of us would last more than a two or three years in those atmospheres they're not they're political they swarm it's not I don't know there's more than money right I I totally agree I think our our actions have showed that but I also think it is entertaining to see like just the the the sort of mindbending amounts that people make doing certain things and in the in the case of uh joining companies early like wow that that's kind of it that's all you really had to do in terms of like financial success there's a funny tweet that chth put out the other day where he was like Bill Gates um you know if he had just basically held his Microsoft stock would be I think the richest man in the world or you know number one or number two something like that and instead you know he did The Gates Foundation he did a whole bunch of other things he like sold and then has his family office and um the top reply which was like a huge ratio was like now do you with meta right because he leaves Facebook he's like great I got a billion bucks and then I'm going to do social capital I'm going to do this I'm going to do that and for you know to do spaxs I'm going to do all these things for like you know the next 12 years 15 years and if he had just simply like held the meta stock and and chilled he would have financially out far outperformed his own you know his own Brilliance doing all this different investing action yeah I you know but that's the thing that's why you got to do things that you actually care about or that light you up or that you motivate you in a way that's different from cash because I mean dude the other thing how many I mean you guys probably have friends like this I have friends who are worth more than I am who have much more money and but they got it through like a meta type situation they're like the most insecure like they're like oh I just got lucky they're afraid to talk about it like it seems like a like a horrible existence like and there's a lot of people I know like that I met one of the founders of YouTube once and the guy was like my lotto ticket success you know I don't like he was he was very unhappy with the amount of money he had made so you think that it's like I'm on Easy Street I get it like but the psychological thing though people feel like fraud I mean it's a whole another there's a whole another Vector of challenges that come with it versus I think all the three of us are founders you start a business whatever it is you made you made it you know you did it like there's a different element to it in my opinion I like talking about it the same way I like looking at mega mansions on the Internet it's fascinating to one part of my brain but then the main part of my brain's like I wouldn't even want that out like yeah exactly like not even in the in it's like dude that's way too big that wouldn't be fun to live in that'd be uncomfortable and man the maintenance of that would be like a pain in the ass like that's not what I want in the same way that when we got acquired by twitch I had thought in the last seven years I had worked towards like I want to build build a you know like a successful tech company right I was in the inter Capital World success in that world is you build a billion dollar plus company we were doing like a social type of product a media product and twitch is like one of the 10 winners that that like actually existed and then I saw emt's day-to-day and I was like oh man I would be miserable if I was doing this and not even in the like like it was just that wasn't fun like his job fundamentally was like putting out fires and you know all problems roll up basically like it's the worst problems roll up yeah [ __ ] rolls up hill exactly and it's the worst problems that rolled up past your executive team because they would solve a bunch of them but the ones that they can't really solve cleanly roll up to you so you get the worst of the worst that that roll up to you and he would sit in the conference room and basically you know his calendar was managed by somebody else it's a 30- minute block and another 30 minute block another 30-minute block and he's reading memos and he's doing decisions all day and I'm like man this is not like like the fun factor is not there and that's when I started asking a question it's why I started this podcast is I was like who's having the most fun rather than who is the most successful who is the most rich it's just fundamentally who having the most fun and I remember looking at Joe Rogan I was like I think Joe Rogan's having a blast it seems like he basically he podcast which is like a unedited unscripted thing he's hanging out with comedian friends or super interesting scientists and paleontologists and just fascinating people like that and then then on the side he does comedy which is like you know a craft that he really cares about that he does he does the UFC which is like a his Hobby and he gets to commentate for that be sit ringside but he also doesn't overdo any of the things meaning he doesn't um do his podcast in a way that's like optimized for views he's not like he's like I want to do a three-hour conversation because that's what I want not because that's optimal for the algorithm for UFC he doesn't travel he's like I'll do the ones that are nearby me but I'm not going to fly around the world every weekend commentating this like I hope that works for you guys same thing with this comedy stuff he's like you know I'm gonna do it the way that I want to do it and when I saw that I was like okay that is a different model of success that I you know I want more than than kind of what I wanted in my 20s you use Joe Rogan but I honestly think you can apply that to anyone like my hedge fund friends who love hedge funding they're happy they love it it's it's finding your thing it's finding the thing that you really enjoy and then just going all in on it those are the people I think who are winning you really got to enjoy like doing it a lot because it's it it all really sucks to get there like to do you guys remember Zuck in ' 06 to maybe it was like 08 to like 15 like I would not have trade places with them I would I would never in a million years trade places with either on mus but the idea of like having all these things me neither no trade I also reject that trade SAR yeah very very very fair of him to say that uh but it does seem cool like I guess what I mean is like I could acknowledge that um that seems awesome that would be cool to have and also uh I'm not willing to do it but it's that's like fantastic yeah I think one of the most powerful things is figuring out what's there's a difference between cool for you and cool for me right like there's so many things where I see people's life setup and I'm like that is super cool for you and like I don't mean that in a negative way it's like I do think it is super cool and I think it's even cooler that it's what you wanted but I have to figure out what is cool for me look like you know what's funny is uh our last episode you talked about the seven spiritual roles uh and I you you talked about that book that you were reading um um or how you were thinking about reading it or something like that and I I went and bought it because I personally I'm in a little bit of a a place now where it's like uh I think some people call it the second Mountain you know you already like achieve a little something to where you're like you you're secure but you're like all right but what's a problem that I want to work on or a way to spend life that may be a little bit higher up a maso's hierarchy of needs and so I'm personally still like asking myself I it's not defined yet for me Jesse do you have one I'm curious yeah you know I've done I think Sean you know this I've spent probably better part of six or seven years on this personal growth Journey which has turned into like a spiritual journey and the the moment came for me maybe three years in when my coach was like what's the one thing you can't not do it's like a really weird question and the exercise for you know you can do it Sam right now what's the one thing you can't not do write down a few sentences and then every week look at those sentences and see if they seem to grow with you that's a good idea and and in one funny way he say like what's the thing that comes in the room when you show up like what's the s because his his point was we try to make purpose this far out thing we have to go get and it's actually the thing already inside of us that we just need to like tap into and live more fully and for for me it was I love helping other people like be the best versions of themselves like raise their game to the next level of what they're capable of even in this podcast like I think I taught you guys two two new things like it just it comes out it's not purposeful NE I've made it more purposeful now but like at the time it wasn't but it was a thing any of my friends would tell you about me any my employees would tell you about like dude Jesse walks in and like the bar goes up and it's like an exciting go up and and so I really like one one of the interesting examples of this he goes so how do you keep your to-do list Jesse and I was like uh initiatives or clients and and it's like what if you kept your your to-do list based on your people you worked with like Executives and how you're helping them be the best versions of themselves he's like you probably still like get the work done that you need to get done but you do it in this very inspired way and Gateway X I mean Gateway X is a whole function of me going the thing I want to do is help other people learn and grow I'm not the CEO of any of these companies like now I do actually keep my to-do list that way I don't write growth assistant or aux I write Adrien and Casey and I'm like how am I helping those those people and I find it's a weird thing when I frame success or my life through the pnls of those businesses I get very like NE like I'm not I'm not as powerful I'm like a you know more a scarc minded person and when I frame it as the like how do I help those individuals which is the same [ __ ] because they're running the businesses I'm like creative and I'm happy and I'm I'm more flowing so for me it's like that's the thing it feels Everly energizing for me like I think I could do it for a really long time and obviously the setup the way I've got it setup matters a lot too like I'm you know not running any of the individual businesses I don't think I want to I don't want to run staff meetings I don't want to run comp plans hiring Pro like all these things I did it you guys have done it like it's not what I want to do but I do want to help grow each of these businesses dude you're awesome I appreciate you doing this thanks man what do think turn on great to see you by the way how'd you get Nelly at your birthday party what was that about tell that story before we go a quick one so I turned 40 in May as you guys know and I have a cool V video montage of the party my wife feel an awesome party but I've been telling telling all my friends about St Louis since I was 18 so I went to college I'm like St Louis is the best city whatever and everyone's like I was like I'll move back there one day they're like no you're not and then I moved back and they're like oh [ __ ] you moved back and so I had 200 people in town who I've been raving to about St Louis for like 10 plus years so I'm like What's the most ridiculous thing you could do if you're me having your 4 like Nelly I mean you guys are somewh similar in age from my high school to Early College Nelly was like the biggest rapper on the planet and he's from my hometown Nelly was our guy he was the first famous St Louis guy and it doesn't matter what race you are where how old you are was like our son he made us so proud if you're in your 30s or 40s Just Close Your Eyes I'm just going to say a few words that'll just take you back Country Grammar Air Force Ones EI hot her oh my God like just the memories that come with those words so so so I'm like all right I'm I'm you know what's the ridiculous thing I could have my party I'm like have Nelly perform there so my wife goes through the normal channels they're like you know he basically doesn't do this right so he's like look it's 300,000 just as a starting price by the time you do it all it's half a million dollars and I'm like I I I want to die with zero but like that's a little little Rich for my blood so I live with zero yeah so I'm like all right we're not gonna do that and then I kind of am sad for a few months and then and then the entrepreneur me goes wait come on there's got to be another way to approach this right so St Louis is not a big place I asked a couple people I go you know Nellie's people right and I'm like can you introduce me and so I get to know they're great by there there's this guy Mike cha and there're the one wonderful guys I get to know them and you know they introduce me as this guy who's like an expert digital marketer e-commerce guy so I'm like hey what's going on what's going on in your world oh a you know Nelly is actually working on two big e-commerce businesses like his team is and I go oh tell me more and they tell me all about it and I'm like okay well here's the thing you should think about and make sure you tag this Pro and and they're like oh wow you know a lot about this and I'm like okay how can I be helpful right and and then I just basically have been working with them and right here's the Shopify app do this here's a good contractor for this they helping their team get it going and at some point it came out the aux business came out and I'm like yeah I charged private Equity firms like2 $300,000 to do this nice right and they're like oh but You' just been doing for free like what can we be helpful I'm like it's funny you ask a young man's dream would be to have Nelly at his birthday party and you know they're they're his people so they're like well let's go talk to him and they go well he's got to meet you because he doesn't know who you are and if doesn't know you so I take my wife you know I get my I get my sort of urban like going I'm there and we become he's super nice guy really friendly dude have you ever been more nervous walking up to that meeting I was nervous my wife was super nervous like why the hell am I here right now we meet him in like this the Soho wannabe in St Louis so Club wannabe you go for the handshake D up what are you doing yeah you know not the handshake but the you know yeah yeah of course and and so he that goes really well yeah my God you start using that phras my guy yeah and he asked me what do you want to do and I think like I was like oh man you got to come out to EI we gotta have the intro it's gonna be like and and he like looks at me he's like okay you're a real fan I'm like yeah man this like you were you were the guy so then they're like okay Nelly loved you we're in then they're like wait what was the date again is May 25th like well he's in Napa on the 24th night at some festival and then he needs to be in Vegas on the 26th day for a day party and they're like there just he he would do it as a friend now because you've helped him but he just can't make the date work Jesse and so again I I'm like depressed for 48 hours and I'm like no [ __ ] this I'm like what if I fly in private both ways and they go we'll talk to him come back next day okay he'll do it but it's got to be a G4 or better oh my God does not fly in anything below a G4 so I go and I do a bunch of like you know I've I've been flying private a little bit since the amp for sale but I was like talk to a bunch of these Brokers and I basically get them to beat each other up and it was round trip so it got a little cheaper per hour than it normally would but for 60 Grand I got him a round trip on a G4 Napa to STL STL to Vegas and he rolls into the you know he roll and he by the way he was amazing at the party like I'll I I'll text you guys videos and stuff like he but it was scary because he wasn't under any contract with me so he could have come out said hey happy birthday Jesse eii eii and he could have left he ends up doing a 45 minutes set and he he told like his manager manager told me he's like dude he was like so hyped it was like all these Indian people who like knew his music like he was so pumped that you guys were all just like rapping my brother and I are on stage rapping eii with him like it was dude it was a top three life moment like it was unbelievable that's so awesome it was the like it was honestly one of the best hours of my life that super cool Little Dicky if you're out there listening I would uh I'm turning 40 in a few years I would love to start you know you got save that dude you got to save that money you yeah you have to hope that like career just goes down I told my wife I'm like for your 50th I'll get Beyonce because hopefully by then I'll have a little more money and you will her stock will be down yeah we got to just catch them right before they hit Cameo so they can't be peeking they got to be on some sort of a decline but like not all the way Rock bottomed yet so that's that's what we're going for um Jesse we appreciate you you're the man thanks for doing this you too guys good to see you all right that's it that's the PA [Music]

this is the story of a guy named scottt meetup.com is probably the most popular thing that he made Meetup is a really cool sign I used it when I moved to San Francisco joined a bunch of groups met a bunch of people it's basically a way to go from the internet to actually meeting people in real life and so I knew about meet up I had even known about Scott but what I didn't know was the story that Scott after he had sold his first company actually went and worked at McDonald's just to kind of reset and he did that for a while and now he was going viral because he's kind of doing it again he didn't tell anybody but people saw him update his LinkedIn and it said Amazon associate or like Warehouse associate or something basically he's back at a Amazon warehouse now being a pick Packer kind of minimum wage job again and people are like dude this is not the first time he's done this he did this with McDonald's like you know 20 years ago and I found this fascinating and I went down to Scott rabbit hole and I want to talk to you about it you have some good stuff there too right is that how it caught your eye Yeah so basically he grew up uh I think in Iowa or Idaho somewhere in the Midwest and he grew up there and he saw that Mark and dreon releases Netscape and he was like this is amazing and so he's like I'm going to get in the internet and so in the mid90s he starts I believe like one of the world's first online Internet agencies I think it was an advertising agency something like that he sells it for around $15 million uh which is something like 30 million bucks in today's money and he sells it and after he sells it he was like I've been working for six or seven years at this internet startup and I work in marketing but I'm only around like bankers and lawyers and other like yepy people that's horrible for my position as a marketer but also like I feel so out of touch with the people here let's use his words so he wrote this on his site you found it back in the internet archive which I thought is great so it says why I got a job at McDonald's I spend a lot of time with bankers lawyers internet Freaks and corporate wonks and other people living strange lives as a good marketing guy that's a bad thing and as a practicing anti-consumerist that's a bad thing so I got a job at McDonald's to help get back in touch with the real world also after six grueling years of the internet Whirlwind I wanted to experienced a profitable well-oiled multi-billion dollar machine and I deserved a break today and then he goes and works at McDonald's and he even talks he shows his application he goes I just walked in off the street it was at like Fifth and Broadway in New York City I walked off uh off the street and he's like the manager was like so are you used to like working with teams or something like that and he and Scott was like in his blog post he goes yeah I was honest I said yeah yes I am used to that yeah he he goes I was truthful in my interview he asked if I can handle a fast-pace intense environment I said yes he looked at my resume and asked about my current part-time job as chairman of eye traffic I said it's an internet thing he said okay and then asked me for for my waist size for the pants and he works there for like six months and he has this amazing blog post about everything that he's learned by the way I don't think he worked there for six months I think it was like more more like three or four weeks something like that but he said 57 5 ain't much so he was making 575 an hour times 40 hours a week time 52 weeks a year that's $1,960 pre-tax he goes some people said it was disrespectful to me to take a job at McDonald's I didn't need the money they thought I was making fun of people that worked there the opposite is true I gained a bucket of respect for people that bust their butt for such low pay it's one thing to scan past like statistics you see about how many people make $112,000 a year read about them in the paper it's another thing to sit back there in a fry heaving McNugget wielding six-hour shift and go home smelling like fries and McNuggets and realize you only made about $30 this day it's an eyeopener interpret that as you see fit and then what happens is while he's working at McDonald's cranes which is a a business publication they want to do a story on Scott about like CEOs in postacquisition life and he's like yeah come and uh see what I'm up to now and they used this photo of him working at McDonald's wearing his McDonald's uniform and it's just the greatest photo I've ever seen and if you scroll through this old blog post we'll link it in YouTube you can see some of these pictures of him working it looks like it it looks pretty wild well they they spun it like he was struggling right it's like dethroned CEOs is the title and they're like how are they handling the dot crash this this do CEO is back working at of McDonald's it's like wait that's not what it's not even what happened at all but okay sure now fast forward to today but by the way he made $15 million I think in that sale so he sold his Agency for about 15 million bucks who knows stock cash who knows the is like but ballpark right let's take a directional and then he goes from there to working at a McDonald's um you know just to kind of like re acclimate with the real world which I thought was was really good and fast forward to today so in 18 or 19 something like that he sells meetup.com to we work the price was rumored to be 200 million but who knows it's enough that he doesn't have to go and work some place like this turns out he has a job at at an Amazon fulfillment center and he doesn't make a bigal out of this he doesn't like tell people about this he just puts it on his LinkedIn someone finds it and shares it so he ends up and uh does a podcast where he talks about the story of of of why he's at Amazon it's the same type of thing where he's like uh I just like felt out of touch with average people and I wanted to I wanted to feel that again and he doesn't exactly say this but he says something like the interviewer was asking him about his experience there and he's like uh the interview was like isn't that that place where like they just had a big issue with uh them the work in the warehouse wanting to unionize and he's like look I don't want to talk too much about that but yeah that's where it was and I think it's a good idea and he sort of insinuates that that he was part of it that he was part of it and he was kind of like whispering in people's ears and he doesn't explicitly say that but the language that he uses where he's like I don't really want to talk about it but yeah like I I was there I saw it all happening and he was like you know it's funny I'm like an entrepreneur and I'm usually the guy who you'd un unionize against but I thought it was a good idea to have a and it's it's as if that he's like the one ring people up and so this guy in a weird way he's like a little for Gump character like he's like experiencing all these things in the background and he's like potentially a pivotal part of the story but he doesn't really talk about it it reminds me of you know like movies and this is a eff up analogy but it's like movies where it's like the the genius nerd gets sent to prison but then he like does you know then he's like the master then he like brings a new angle and sort of rallies the the crew inside the prison a different way right or like we had on the podcast and he was talking about the same thing he said he went to prison and he started the Bitcoin club like the crypto club and he started all these like learning clubs for technology inside the prison but then they also taught him a bunch of things this was like meeting of the of the world that's what this reminds me of this like sort of going into the Fulfillment center and and like stirring up the union the union efforts all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

for some reason he's saying that one of the best measures of your aging is like your nighttime erections so I'm I'm starting doing this treatment where it's like you shock wave your penis Etc and he's like I'm going once a month Etc I'm like dude I have that machine in my house I feel like I can rule the world I know I could be what I want to I put my all in it Jack is this aging stuff this anti-aging stuff is this legitimate like does all this stuff actually make a difference anti-aging it's emerging Trend right and I kind of feel that it's just it's hard to know if this is a scam or not and then how why do we give Brian Johnson Dave aspey Etc any credibility because how do we know that they're good at anti-aging that they're in their 50s Dave aspey can say he wants to live to 140 and stuff right but for me one the only measures we have about if these guys stuff is working is their aging scho thing right I was just thinking of an analogy and I kind of felt it's like saying that someone's a great marathon runner but they're only at the halfway point like maybe these guys are good at avoiding injuries so they're more likely to complete the marathon but how do we know if they're going to get a good time in the Maran only know when they're like a hundred or something in comparison so these are the people we look to as the influencers even like Dr Ronda Patrick for women she's in her 4S I I think so they're all middle-aged petera huberman they're not 100 years old so how do we know they're good at anti-aging they're only halfway there I mean Sam you had a better anti-aging score like you couldn't upload your results right but you would be like number one I think on there from your thing yeah Sean I did the Rejuvenation Olympics like basically the re uh Rejuvenation Olympics it's this test done by true Diagnostics it's like a it's like a blood work company and Brian has a partnership with him and I think the science is still like iffy but the idea is like if this if the length of a cell that you have I forget which what the cell is called mitochondria or something like that there's a theory that like the length of that is correlated to your biological age I did this test Sean and I scored great so great that I messaged Brian Johnson and I was like this is wrong right and he's like well no like you're you you you you're like the number three on the Rejuvenation Olympics and the thing is is like I'm a 8020 type of guy I do like 80% great and then I like [ __ ] off for 20% like I I eat poorly sometimes and but I just think that a lot of this the takeaway from when I did that thing was it's mostly genetics I think I do mostly good stuff but there's people who do so much better stuff and I just think that it's like largely genetics but because that one of the only measures we have is this score then it means that that gives that's the only lender of credibility we have to to if you're any like you guys are able to present this podcast because you sold your companies right so you have some legitimacy there but the only legitimate uh Limas test we have here is your aging score but then it's like okay Sam you have legitimacy so you can just say oh I have a great score because I have Coke Zero every day and then everyone buys Coke Zero and thinks that's anti-aging best supplement right so what why do you spend so much energy on this then because you're spending money you're spending time yeah it sounds like what you're saying is look the science the measurement is iffy the incentives are a little iffy because there's a lot of money to be made by by claiming certain things you know we're not it's not clear the cause and effect we don't know what what really works what really doesn't work you've spent $50,000 in supplements and your submar was like H I didn't really feel anything maybe if you're deficient you might feel something but you're a smart guy why still spend the time and energy in this space because actually uh I've tried out all these different things right and Tony Robin actually has a book about all the emerging Health stuff that he tries out Etc so 99% of it I don't notice anything however 1% I do notice big things and for me it's kind of like okay we don't know what works what doesn't work but I've only got one life and I've only got one body and just experimenting I can find those 1% things that are very impactful and like under the radar and stuff the the the one % stuff if I had to guess is just eating mostly plants and animals and lifting heavy weights and like going for walks so actually not for me but um yeah oh well [ __ ] me then all right what is it so one thing and this is this sounds crazy as well right this so this this is the thing all of these things have all the science and they're like and and Dave as or someone can be like okay this like extract of blueberry it reduces your aging because does this Etc like and then all here's 50 medical studies Etc one thing that actually has been a game changer for me my family the science just doesn't make any sense like the science isn't there and I don't spend much money but I I've spent $15,000 on this thing and that's like the low-end one it's called Energy enhancement system and that's what I call sex my friend it's like Sarah is it time for some energy some EES tonight so what is this so basically at the high end these machines cost over $100,000 to set up again the science when I'm looking at it like I'm a tech guy right so I'm going in I'm wait in the waiting room and I'm looking around I'm like dude this is just a normal computer monitor like what what what's the deal and they're saying like oh these are all there's like 16 of these computer monitors and computers all laser aligned and it creates an energy vortex in the middle of the room let me explain if you Google this you're going to see a photo the photo looks like a doctor's waiting room except the chairs are literally lawn chairs we're talking $30 lawn chairs the type you would bring to like your kids soccer game and then the room has eight TVs and the TVs this looks like a sports book you ever go to Vegas and where you can bet on Sports and there's 18 different monitors horse racing over here basketball over here and you sit in the shitty chair that's what this looks like and like you know how like when you're a kid and you in the cable used to go out and it would be like a bunch of like colors on the screen it basically just looks like that that is it yeah that's what I'm I want to let you know that's what I'm looking at and I want to let you know this sounds incredibly ridiculous what you were saying go ahead I'm openminded continue there's also people claiming that this cured their cancer like if you look what this can be used for they just say whatever's wrong with you this will cure it this cured cancer this cured AIDS so I but I go in and I'd actually been suffering for a year with severe headaches I had this thing where it's called um new daily persistent headaches it means basically you wake up one day and you have a headache every day so I'd been struggling with that for a year and I tried loads of stuff like ozone therapy um ketamine like I tried everything and did I actually think think that this EES thing is the only thing that worked I just went in there and I sat in a lawn chair for an hour maybe two hours and then just came out and in my stomach like I can feel my stomach like reorganizing Etc churning but not only me yeah my wife it cured her migraines her uh sister came out and then she'd been having trouble sleeping it like cured her sleeping issues and then her mom did it as well with us like it's crazy actually Tony Robbins had you can pay like a lot more and sleep in the room overnight so Tony Robbins has spent two days in it so I have no idea about the science but I've tried out so much stuff and I actually think this was the only thing that worked even though the science nobody can explain it it doesn't make any sense it and it also doesn't help that when new Google energy enhancement system the first listing is their website the second listing is uh paperwork from the state of Nevada about how they're being sued so like the not a good look Jack not explaining the science second listing is the a lawsuit that they're facing this sounds ridiculous where do we go from here all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have noide idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show I just playing Jack I think this is uh very interesting to be honest I also again I can't emphasize this enough what's interesting about you is that as crazy as you sound right now you're actually a very smart guy and the cool thing about you is that you're a very independent thinker meaning I think if something somebody presents something to you you're quite skeptical by default even things that are like consensus you're you kind of question like wait why does that work how does that work are you sure that that works but you're also extremely open-minded and experimental which means you're going to land on random things I don't know if this is one of them but like random things that are kind of non-consensus but but work right which is you know as an investor those are things that you want as an entrepreneur those are things that that have served you well and now in in in your post entrepreneurial career you're you're doing the same thing which I find interesting I think I'm kind of just like if Brian Johnson drank too much coffee and just got ADHD and tried that bunch of stuff like what I really admire about him is like if he's testing something he's like testing like okay how does this affect my blood work to know is it working whatever whereas I'm just like okay let's just throw [ __ ] at the wall and see what sticks like just try out everything like some of the stuff that Brian was trying like was just messaging him on Twitter I'm like dude I was trying that like two years ago like um some of the different emerging stuff but I was not actually I just tried some things and then see all right does that do anything like he had talked recently about for some reason he's saying that one of the best measures of your aging is like your nighttime erections I don't know if you've seen this so um he measures his directions looked into it yeah I'm I'm starting doing this treatment where it's like Shockwave therapy um that you Shockwave your penis Etc and he's like I'm going once a month Etc I'm like dude I have that machine in my house I didn't see that when I visited you should have let me you should have let me give it a whirl should why don't you tell your guest that I would have love to give him that give him that thing a try so what's the word on that Jack does it do anything oh actually is yeah I don't know how what should we talk about uh AIT yes well I was going to tell you um if you want because the other bit is like yeah thanks again for having you back on the Pod because meet so many interesting people and your exposure has grown so much and then I've met a number of people even in Portugal that listen to it and so I speaking to some listeners and they said okay we what we want is like they said to me like okay Sam and Shan sometimes they just tell stories too much so we want actionable stuff as well and we want business ideas so one idea that I can share with you is that what you got I've got one business idea was considering it but then it doesn't make any sense for me but it seems to make sense I would think for other people is that um kind of like doing like the Samir Brothers by the way did you uh Sean did you just he just kind of like you know a lot of people are complaining about your podcast because of this so I'm gonna fix it for you the complaint was like yeah you guys talk too much the podcast what are I supposed to do it's like uh don't worry I've got the solution things that are actionable specific useful insightful and not that other stuff that they usually do go Ahad what the samare brothers s brothers like you know they cloned Airbnb and brought it to Europe so the sare brothers wait we got to give contact samare brothers are uh these these three German brothers who are famous because starting in like 1999 they copied eBay but for Germany and within 90 days they started and sold it for close to $100 million and then they did that with Airbnb Amazon so they would just find Silicon Valley companies and their whole thing they didn't use great words because they're German they're not allowed to use this word but they called it Blitz greeing they would blood blood scre the internet so they would find uh Amazon and do that in Thailand they would do Airbnb but in France whatever and oftentimes they were so hardcore they made them massive to the point where they couldn't even like they try to build a company to sell to Groupon but their Groupon competitor got bigger than Groupon and they're like [ __ ] no one could buy us and so they're famous for doing that anyway go ahead so I was thinking you can do something similar but for just like bootstrapped businesses like it doesn't need to be a tech VC type thing and just one dumb example is like um in San Francisco and they think they have in Austin Etc like you can get a dexa scan D XA for like $25 $30 and it body spec it's awesome and the test takes like seven minutes and they've just got the process down amazingly they have a van with this dexa scam machine in it and they're just giving people seven minutes appointments like go in do a scan and gym people and many people in general just love it because it's the mo it's I think it is the most effective way of measuring body fat in your body there's different methods you can use I believe this is the most accurate and if you're and it's measured like muscle mass so if you're working out at a gym it tells you if you're gaining muscle or not and in San Francisco it's really accessible but then in Portugal for example just one example like you can only do it at a hospital and in Lisbon like it's not anywhere else in the rest of the country and it costs like $200 you need to drive there body spec was bootstrapped and they built it to like more than two million in Revenue even with just like 14 Vans I think and the rollout strategy is pretty simple like you just partner with like CrossFit Gyms and you just park in their parking lot you know so you're like all right on Monday we're going to be in this CrossFit gym on Tuesday we'll be here Etc so I felt like just cloning that in Portugal um you just buy can get a used Dexter scam machine we went to Mr BEAST's house and he has one in his office actually just people coming by and everyone thinks it's cool to just do a dexa scan like he asked um he asked asked like oh does anyone want a dexa scan I've got one in the office um you can buy it for like it was great by the way one guy jumped on the dexa scan and we all bet his body fat percentage it's just like the ultimate like you can't do this in society anymore but we were like oh no no he's for sure he's for sure 18.3 no no no no way I'm going under and then somebody got it right how much are those machines I knew I think like 50,000 and that was more affordable than I thought because a whole body MRI scanner which looks kind of similar but it's doing an MRI scan that's a million dollars and so this like 50k reasonable and then I saw some used for like 15,000 and then you just put it in a van Patrick cell our buddy Patrick just bought one oh he did uh for he basically so he lives in Puerto Rico and he bought so he bought a DEX machine and he put it like I think in kind of like a community like he has like a gym and it's like kind of he made it like a community area so like anybody in his kind of xat neighborhood can come there and like you know work out and do it um so he did it as like a he's interested in it but also it will attract other health people like kind of a social thing almost by by adding this machine yeah I used to do that as a kid but we did it with breathalyzers like why' buy a breath LI or go to a party we all surround it and like try to guess but doing with with the MRI or whatever would be a lot would be a lot more fun so Jack the idea is to Samir body spec so you basically clone the body spec bootstrapped business model in Europe yeah because you could launch it for like less than $50,000 and I mean a a van you can probably buy on finance as well and this medical machine just like Finance Etc and just get one van and that could kind of serve all of Portugal even you know just be like all right on Monday I'm in Lisbon and then on Tuesday we'll be in this region on Wednesday we'll be here and you book people seven minutes Lots when that's working just either get another van or just get another van in Spain in Barcelona in France like because it's just not out here but every but like it has strong appeal it has wide appeal and it's affordable like even my wife is not into this kind of thing but she's interested like how is my uh I'm working out so is it working like I want to see am I gaining muscle and stuff so yeah that was one I do that's a cool idea like that have you guys seen uh pren noo have you seen pren noo Sean yeah yeah I've done a PR noo scan is so I'm gonna go do one as well it's a pretty like wild idea I don't know if it's effective or not but basically getting an MRI like I think we've actually talked about the Sean like I think in 50 or 100 years we're going to look back and we're going to be like can you believe that since the beginning of time you could have can or something bad growing in your body and you would just have no idea you would have no idea that it'd be like an intruder in your home like I don't know there there could be someone down there we're not sure and often times or or some of the times they say well had you just found this earlier basically had you come through our front doors and gotten this MRI we could have solved this like this was a very solvable thing and so they kind of take they're taking that that idea and anyone can pay money it's 30 500 for one or a th for like a lower-end version and you could walk in off the street and get these MRI full body scans and I don't know if they're if they're great or not but the idea of that is cool was it cool Sean I mean it's definitely cool you go you lay down and they basically do a full body MRI which normally either like would take a long time it'd be like four hours or something but they do this in one hour because of their they basically have rejiggered traditional MRI machines this is what they tell you right so they say we've rejiggered the MRI machines and now we can do it faster and we can get higher resolution we can get more more images and then we have special software that can that can read it and and all this stuff and then so I went there laid down watched a Top Gun and came out and they were like cool you don't have cancer I was like all right guess I'll just go back to my day then um and you know that was that um I thought that's kind of amazing and I I love the mission of it so I love the mission of basically knowing understanding what's going on in your body being more proactive versus reactive when it comes to you know you said so many things that if we had caught this sooner that that's like you know one of the the great regrets of life right um and that you know it's like the Tesla Model they're starting with this really expensive thing that only kind of like Rich Health nuts can do and then but the goal is over time get this get the cost down um through you know economies of scale as well as like the technology curve going down so that you know these become instead of a few thousand dollars a few hundred dollar um to do and then more people will do them that's the idea now I must say the counter argument which is I was pretty pumped about this I uh but I'm also like a noob I'm a Layman I don't I don't know the science behind this stuff I don't know what's real and what's not I showed it to a friend of mine who was a who's a surgeon and I my best buddy from college and I was like hey I did this thing have you heard about it he's like no let me check it out and um and so he's like cool can you send like send me the scan and I was like oh you can actually yeah you can get the F like the folder here's the zip folder of all my my images and and cuz he was like that doesn't sound right he's like I don't think you can do what they're saying you can do like I don't think he he's like I don't believe that you can get that many images at that resolution using this technology nor do I think you can see um what's actually like you know a dangerous thing without doing the like you drink the thing and then it's like contrast like it lights up differently in your body um he's like I don't believe that and so he's like show me the images I show them the images and I'm trying to defend it but I also don't know [ __ ] I'm like no no no it's it's technology like the guy he had the story his friend died so you know he was motivated and he's like what what are you talking about just show me the images I showed him the images he's like so these are normal MRI images these are not he's like first of all this is less images than they say they have he's like look at this on their website they say we take this many slices uh this many this many Cuts he's like look there's 27 images in here so where's the images he's like secondly this looks exactly like an image um he's like thirdly I can see your penis in this I was like oh God damn it and he's like four um he's like fourth you know the resolution or the ability to see what's actually going on like this would not be useful enough to do any kind of diagnosis and then I was at a dinner with the guy who started poovo and I was like hey uh not to be buzz kill but like I did a scan talk to my doctor buddy and he starts laughing as soon as I I talk to my doctor friend and he's like oh I know I know and I was like okay well I'm gonna say it anyways he said that it doesn't make sense and it didn't really work and that there was not like not as many images and the resolution he's like like no that's doctors always say that they do you know blah blah blah I'm like well isn't that a bad thing if doctors always say that he's like no no no I mean like not all doctors but you know we hear that a lot I was like cool so what's the answer and uh you know what would I tell my friend that would uh have him not believe that I'm you know getting thanosed here and he was like you need like our software to be able to we have like machine learning and he starts saying some words like we have special software that reads this I was like cool but that doesn't fully like I felt kind of like he brushed it off now he it might have just been because it was a dinner and he didn't have time to get into the details and maybe he is really sick of just hearing this over and over again I'm not sure but I personally didn't walk away super convinced that uh in either direction that this is like super useful or not and I'm saying the whole thing because I've seen a lot of people promoting this thing and uh just if it's useful here is a personal anecdote Counterpoint do your own research and figure it out but that that's kind of where I where I landed with it where I thought well if somebody can explain something simply to me and in a way that's convincing then I I you know I'll I'll just air on the side of it's probably not miraculous is kind of where I landed to say one pro Point Sam and I were at dinner and um the lady said like she just had a feeling that her boyfriend should do this scan she wasn't sure why just kind of had a feeling and then did the scan and they found a lump and he had cancer he had cancer and he got surgery like two months later and the surgeon was like how did you detect that you had this you don't have any symptoms and if we hadn't caught if you had caught this just like a few months later you actually would either be dead or not be able to speak right now and so she's becoming like they are becoming like advocates for this like in their marketing videos and stuff so that's a a pro that it it did catch it ahead of time and I have heard that also from other people too and they when you go in they say one in 20 scans so you know 5% of people who come in have a potentially life-saving diagnosis now it's again it's hard to verify a claim like this it's hard to know but I have heard anecdotally other people say oh yeah we did go we did find something so you know it's not nothing uh and but even besides that as a business this thing is Gang Busters right like uh they make so much money off of off this they've got I don't know how many locations but they just raised like $70 million um for to expand pruvo and I think they're in like I don't know 20 20 cities around the country now so one thing as well say is like I've done this thing called cubio which it's funded by Google and there are at least 70 million in funding perhaps more than 100 million it's kind of a compet to brovo Etc so I've done that in America they similarly say like okay well I was the chief medical officer at Google and we have all these Google Engineers so we do Ai and that's why we can do it in 45 minutes instead of four hours ETA like yours saying Sean I did the same thing in India and got exactly the same results and I was only doing it for 40 minutes like I think they're just Silicon Valley branding they're also Google engineers in India turns out there's just a lot of Google Engineers out there Google Engineers like the Harvard Extension school graduate right it's like there's a lot of people that have this stamp so one other business idea I did think after going to this Retreat because this Retreat as I said it was $66,000 but just what was it called um it's called aiwo is the center there $6,000 it included that MRI that in America you're paying more than $33,000 for and that was just like like a few hours part of it this was a whole week and included Your hotels Etc but then um speaking to other people they were like you know many other countries have amazing medical Tech turkey Korea Etc the challenges they have with is branding and also like the printouts might be Korean or Turkish Etc so I think what this guy the AO place is doing amazing is he's targeting um people that are interested in biohacking following Brian Johnson Etc and then he's getting the influencers so he just got the guy who's number one number two on Brian Johnson's leader leaderboard he told that guy hey you can come for free but just bring like uh just refer eight people and you also be there to help people interpret their blood test results or whatever so get all these other people to pay 6K and I'll give it to you for free I feel you could just brand a biohacking center in any other country if you have strong links to the country because what they were doing here is they don't have their own MRI scanner he just took us to MRI s he just took us to all these different labs in India he just made connections with them and they kind of just got us to skip to the front of the queue you know so a concierge medical for anti-aging but you could do that in other countries we had um a buddy Jack I don't know if you remember this Sean you might have know him too when we worked out of the founders Dojo they had this crazy business and it didn't end up working but they had a lot of people who are interested but they couldn't get them over the line but basically if you want to get a boob job or other types of plastic surgery you could get it in America of which it's elective and it's very expensive or or you could go to India and get it done or Mexico and get it done and the claim is that the doctors are as good the care is as good but it's 5% of the price so instead of I don't know how much a boob job cost but let's say instead of $20,000 it's $1,500 or $2,000 and these people had created this business called it was all on medical tourism which I didn't know that was a thing and they got a lot of interested customers but because they were a startup they could convince these people to trust them and things like that but it was actually pretty interesting when they told me this I was like there's no way people are going to do that but there are a lot of people willing to do that I remember that John Howard was doing that right John Howard yeah I don't remember why it didn't work out I guess they just couldn't get people over the line but we were in this office where with like guys were mining Bitcoin and all this [ __ ] and they were like in this little room trying to convince these people to fly to India to get like their like a root canal yeah get like a root canal in like Mexico like yeah you can go on the beach afterwards and just sit there like and it was just I know a lot of people that actually do this and you know I think all he missed was it was just a hair transplants in Turkey was all he needed to do that like Jack you got a beautiful head of hair but have you looked into can you explain to me what's going on with the turkey thing why is this seems incredibly popular and also why turkey I'm not sure why why turkey what they were saying in India is they're just like hey we've just got so many people here in India that um he's like if you in America if you've got some obscure disease then none of the doctors have ever come across it before whereas in India like there's like 10 other the P they had 10 other patients that week with the same issue and it is true a bunch of the doctors in India I was speaking to the guy and they had studied and worked in England they're not like going to some random he's like oh I studied at this medical university in England so they're saying is quantity of people I'm not sure what attributes make turkey um the leading bit for hair transplants and stuff all right I'm going to do a deep dive on the turkey hair transplant thing it's insane like I have seen uh so many people do this I think it's like basically times less or something than than in the US um so you know I think there there's obviously a cost component but I just don't know why turkey there's this funny photo that this guy shared online where he was like on his way back from Turkey on the air on the on the airplane and he took a picture of all the men sitting on the plane and there was literally like 10 heads that you could tell that the hair had just gotten sewn in uh and so I was like holy [ __ ] this thing is Big yeah like there's Instagram influencer like transplant Daddy that are like the the the Turkish guys and they're just every day that's the content that they're posting um and it seems like an kind of incredible business for whatever reason I don't know how it works liability you know like the people recommending it because you know stuff can go wrong even in America um one I've done a bunch of different stuff um potentially you could call it like plastic surgery so I don't know what the definition of plastic surgery is but one bit I did that was actually really effective for me is I before I sweated a lot so kind of embarrassing you know if you're t-shirt or whatever you're sweating and I did this um thing where they actually freeze the sweat glands under your arm and um it now I did that like eight 10 years ago and um reduced my sweating like 90% like didn't even need to use doodan so I was like oh this is this was gamechanging for me wow and then this company also with the same is that healthy for you to freeze your sweat gland I feel like sweating is like isn't like a natur like regular I still swe like on my forehead but like I I sweat I still sweat just not under your arms which is going to be the most um embarrassing perhaps but um this same company also had using the same technology they're freezing cells and then those cells die doing the same thing for freezing and killing fat so I was telling my friend like oh yeah I did the surgery well I don't know if you call it surgery because it was based it was not any needles or cutting anything just freezing and I was telling him about it because he was interested in fat loss and I was like oh the that it worked really good for me to stop sweating maybe you should do it for the fat loss being so he went in didn't really do much for him but then later I was reading the news and then I'm like okay thank thankfully at least it just didn't work for him the another celebrity had done exactly the same thing I told him to go and do but for her it was just a very one in a thousand it did it does the opposite it actually makes you grow fat instead of kills the fat so now she's deformed and like can't leave the house so that's why you need to do your own research because I was telling my friend like oh yeah this was great for me like you should just do it you have this thing on here we asked you uh in advance what you want to talk about you have this thing on here that I thought was interesting and I don't know what exactly what it means but it sounds intriguing you're like there's a counter to uh founder beast mode uh what does that mean it was funny because at the camp FM I was trying to explain to Mr Beast the project that I'm working on now so I was saying like you know people working Tech and then they get burned out and they so I'm building a place for them to detox from technology and recover from burnout he's like I literally cannot relate at all to this idea because I just don't get burned out but he has amazing strategy but like the thing is 99% of people can't do this which is he said I'm either on 100% or I'm off 100% so he said I'll just work like seven days um in a row until I pass out and sleep and I'll just keep waking up every day every day every day and just keep doing that but then when I feel that I'm getting burned out I'll just do zero work and I'll just watch documentaries all day and just procrastinate all day I'll feel better again and then I'll go a 100 but it could also be that you know he's in his 20s like he's not super old like I was speaking to this other Portuguese startup here and they're like yeah I don't I don't know what burnout is either they're like 23 and they're just like working all these hours and I said one thing analogy I thought of is like I went to this thing like y combinator Angel pad and I've never worked that hard or achieved that much in three months it's three 90 days I just worked so intensely and we just got amazing stuff done we raised two million in funding we got a we came up with a business idea we managed to get a CTO to join our team we achieved loads of stuff but for me that was a 90-day Sprint that's if you're just try to do that endlessly it's like telling your bolt like okay great you just ran the 100 met just keep up that pace we're now doing a marathon but just keep up that same Pace you ran the 100 meters in it doesn't work like at some point you might feel like it's going okay but at some point I feel like you are going to burn out so for me balance is important and not having tunnel vision just be like I'm being productive productive productive I feel procrastination can have benefits as well the way we came up with the idea for vungle is we were just playing around with a bunch of different mobile apps and we wanted to record a meeting with one of the coaches that we had there so we're like hey is it okay if we just record the meeting to take notes and so we opened this voice recording app and then it was free and then it started blaring some video ad on like full volume and then that call for like cocacola or something and actually that's how we got the idea like wait a minute what if these ads instead of being really intrusive and advertising something not relevant to us what if they were Advertising based on our uh user profiles other apps that we might like so it's that kind of balance I think yeah I think what you're saying makes a ton of sense I I think about everything in either Seasons or gears there's are words I use a lot which is you know there are seasons of Life Seasons where you're going to Sprint and focus Seasons where you're going to explore and wander I find it very useful for myself to label the seasons know what season I'm in and embrace That season cuz if you're in the season of wander it's very easy to feel really anxious that you're not being productive but you have to remind St that's not what this season is this is a season of a sort of exploring dabbling whatever if you're in a season of of productivity or Focus you might feel guilty for saying no to go into your friend's thing or to go into this event or whatever but you remind yourself that's what this season is and this won't last forever the fact that it's time boxed as a season maybe it's 30 days 60 days 90 days uh a year is very useful because you know okay this is not forever but for now this is the right thing to do the other thing I talked about is Gears like I need to have multiple gears like a car that I can shift into and out of personal life I do this with like I can be in work Creator boss mode but if I bring that guy to my marriage it's not a great marriage right so I need to be a different guy when it comes to marriage when it comes to my kids I'm silly playful dad and so I like intentionally think okay like I almost visualize in my head like I'm shifting gears now I'm gonna be that other guy and I want to have a few of these characters that are very useful to me versions of me that I can say all right you're driving now I'm going to a workout so it's not silly playful Dad it's more of the workout which is like guy who's willing to push harder to be you know a little more intense and so I think you want to have both I think you want to be able to when you know what to do be able to focus and when you when something's not working be able to zoom out and get go go wider diverge and Dabble and and sort of procrastinate and play until you figure out something worth focusing on not everything is obviously worth focusing on so I I definitely agree with you there I also think that the the stage of life right matters a lot right when I was when I first met Sam and I met you jack I was probably 24 25 years old I remember the that year I slept in the office I think 215 days out of the year it was a nice office but still you know I was just like totally devoted to it I don't think I was particularly productive I was just like willing to throw everything at this and when I wasn't at the office I was doing our Mastermind dinners I was doing other things that I thought might help me be successful because it was really the only thing I cared about at that time was to be successful now I'm 36 years old I don't have that same burning desire to be successful I care about other things and so you know what today makes no sense to me made a lot of sense back then and and vice versa so you know I think I kind of I agree with pretty much everything you said I don't think it's at odds with with the way that I operate at least well one bit I did uh thought was interesting to think about is that for me actually people don't put enough time into thinking what they want and I think Sean um like us you just touched on Sean but all of us I think did clearly we we knew our North Star why we're working really hard right and Mr Beast I told Sam I was not joking but Sam was like laughing off but I was serious I was like I think Mr Beast if he wanted he can be president of the US at some point because he just since the age of 15 has just had one goal and it's not changed for 10 whatever years he just said I want to be the number one on YouTube and that has not changed he's not changed that and he said no to a bunch of things but he just decided on that and went all in on that and surrounded himself by other people who were chasing the same goal but it was just all in on that it kind of um struck me a bit that I think actually a lot of people don't put enough time into thinking what they want yeah you brought up something that I get pretty fired up about which is figuring out what you want and taking the time to do it I think I've I've been really bad about this the reason I get fired up is because I look back at years of my life I spent on the wrong things and you know that's a very expensive thing like years in my 20s are sort of like Prime assets that's the beachfront real estate of my life and if I spent it on things that I didn't really think through or actually in retrospect were sort of obviously dumb things to to to work on that that brought a lot of kind of like Lessons Learned for me and I what what was that lesson project selection is the most important thing that amongst talented people the the biggest sort of variable that actually happens assume you're going to do the table Stakes right which is you're not going to do the thing Jack talking about like you're not going to just not like take no action on something like I I was already past that I was going to take action I was going to work like hard enough maybe I wasn't going to be the hardest worker on Earth but I was willing to work hard enough to make the thing happen and again I'm also like intelligent enough I'm not the smartest guy but I'm that's not that's not the reason I'm gonna fail is because I just can't figure something out uh okay so there's me and like I don't know everybody I knew all of my friends we're all in that same boat we were all we all wanted it we're willing to take action willing to work hard enough and we're all about smart enough to figure things out so what was the biggest difference in in like where everybody landed and how their life went and it was Project selection it was you know the people like at the time when I sort of started to think about this I was trying to build a sushi restaurant it's like okay building a restaurant is probably you know on the low end of like poor project selection decisions especially for somebody like me who didn't have a passion for food nor was like you know that was not my dream like I did not get joy out of making food every day or you know bringing to life uh you know a manual or whatever so absolutely the wrong project for me um and then I just sort of made similar mistakes along the way when I even when I had a golden opportunity where you know uh the Birch family believed in me they hired me they they named me CEO they give me a blank check and a team full of Engineers and basically they funded like $15 million and a bunch of Engineers to running this idea lab where I could think of any idea I wanted but the the one boundary box was it had to be kind of consumer and then he liked social and I liked social and everybody likes social the the idea that we could create the next Twitter next Facebook that was so sexy uh but it was again like pretty terrible selection where you know the odds of success even amongst the most brilliant people you know are are sort of like point oh like there like six people have done it you know in the last 30 years period six human beings on Earth that have made like a Snapchat a Twitter a whatever and so again poor project selection like at a time where what I really cared about was being successful I was choosing a project that had like almost no chance of being successful and I really wasn't smart enough to see the opportunities around me that that were much much better for me at the time but I read you this this thing I was reading this essay by Paul Graham it's called why smart people have bad ideas he talks about this exact thing you know before he started white combinator he did V web but before he did V web have you guys heard of the startup he did before that no not that can remember it's something called artics and so basically uh it was like 1995 and they have this idea called artics and it's basically to put web galleries online and he's like oh it's great because I love painting I love art I'm kind of like a programmer I understand like this internet thing is here and uh that seems important so like what's the internet idea oh I should marry my two Hobbies art on the internet and he's like cool and so he says in retrospect I wonder how much how I wonder how we could have wasted our time on something so stupid galleries were not excited about being on the web even now you know decades later let alone back in 1995 they don't want to have all their stock visible to some random online Anonymous visitor um like that's not how the art World Works um and he's like basically we couldn't sell the thing we couldn't get any customers and he's like by the way we're not alone here like Paul Allen and Bill Gates before they started Microsoft they started you know traff data and he's like it was not anywhere near as successful as Microsoft like same talent but working on the wrong project um Alex rosi had a great way of saying this he said when he was doing his gym business he went to like a mastermind and at The Mastermind the guy was like cool I heard everything you just said about how you've made your five gyms successful he's like um you're like a nine out of 10 execution on a two out of 10 opportunity and you're asking us how to execute better when actually you should be saying you should be realizing that you're only working on a two out of 10 opportunity for me that was sushi restaurant for him that was running brick and mortar gyms and once he changed what he was doing like he didn't have to work 10 times harder but he could get literally 100 times the level of success so Paul Graham says this thing he goes so why does this happen why do hackers have bad business ideas let's look at our case we had such a lame idea because it was the first thing we thought of I was in New York trying to be a starving artist at the time the starving part was easy and he's like I was looking at art galleries anyways and when I learned to make website it seemed natural to to mix the two together he go if you're going to spend years working on something it might be wise to at least spend a few days considering different ideas instead of just going with the first idea that comes in your head you would think but people don't in fact this is a constant problem even in just the world of painting if you if you want to go be a still life painter you would sit down in front of your table with you know all your materials and you might spend five minutes thinking about what you're going to paint but it's hard to spend more time than that looking at the blank canvas you we get so impatient that we just start painting anything but the problem is painting takes time it could take you know days weeks months to finish a painting you're going to go back and wish you know halfway through that maybe you had thought about what you actually wanted to paint but it's too late you've already kicked it off just because you couldn't sit there you know for for an hour thinking about what to work on and basically says that this is the same thing they see in YC too uh that basically Founders will pick an idea because it's too uncomfortable to sit in the not- knowing and think about what you actually want to do and what what actually might be interesting for you what might actually might be a good idea and so we just start and I this is what I was guilty of at the beginning was just starting and it seems like cool cool I'll change it later but once you start you get wed to it like I remember when we thought about pivoting we only thought about pivoting to other restaurant ideas or other online delivery things it was like we could only think inside this box because anything else felt like admitting failure giving up starting from scratch going back to the bottom of the mountain even though that might have been the right way to do it it mentally was was far too hard to do that I think maybe I might have mentioned this on a previous episode I can't remember but actually Mark hres has something he says like the most important factor in determining if a startup will be successful like a billion dollar company said most investors think like it's the team or the actual product or idea like oh wow that's an amazing team and he said he thinks it's none of those he thinks the most important factor is the the market size of the market and growth rate it's saying if you just have a crappy Market you can have amazing execution the best team ever but they're inhibited by into how big a company they can build by the size of the market yeah there's a there's a funny business school like anecdote where a guy comes in and he's he's given this talk and he says all right business schol you want to create like a successful like hot dog stand what's the number one what's the number one factor of success for a hot dog stand and you know hand goes up location say not location I say uh you know ingredients having the highest quality product do you want to have the best product on the market says nope they say marketing you got to be able to to get the word out there and spread your your story nope he says the number one thing to make a successful hot dog stand is a starving crowd and he said just in general as a lesson of Entrepreneurship like you should be hunting for starving crowds because if you go to a starving crowd even without the best marketing without the best uh you know product without the best team or execution you will still succeed and I you know I forgot the the phrase here but it's like you know when a when a great entrepreneur meets a bad Market uh you know only one of them keeps their reputation the bad Market keeps their reputation whereas if it's a great market and you're even an okay entrepreneur you you'll still be successful it's a very hard lesson to internalize um but has proven very you know true in my life at least it's really hard to pick a great Market we were lucky that we did and many other companies in the same industry as us also became um really big companies but luck the big factor there yeah I remember you telling the story about um vungle so vungle made like video ads for iPhone apps and one of Sha's buddies helped start this thing called app Lov which became this huge thing and um it's same type of company and I don't know what it was worth Sean like 30 or 40 billion like a huge sum and I remember Jack I think you I forget exactly how you phrased this but you're like we only did okay uh and we had a $750 million exit you know we could have been like as big as these other ones because the market just pulled this out of us like people were just begging for this product and like you weren't technical at the time you're or you weren't very technical your partner wasn't technical I don't think at all uh and I was I'm like how how on Earth you do this because I think when You' sold there was some article that said vungle was making a million dollars a day so you guys were going to do $360 million the year you sold in revenue and you were just saying you're like d people are just begging for this thing and we just got so lucky that we just picked it right when the iPhone came out and we got it was just like it just got we got really lucky with that because we didn't do that good our competitors App 11 they were 30 times bigger or whatever the App 11 Market is they're a$ 28 billion dollar company right now yeah and they're like they literally 30 times bigger and we only did okay but we still you know made $800 million or whatever uh and that kind of like I learned that lesson from you about picking the right market so so when Furon so Furon who's my my co-founder at bio he was previously the the CTO and co-founder of app and so when he joined app was doing really well back then but it wasn't it didn't look like a$ 30 billion doll company it looked like a$1 billion doll company but I was like wow this guy built a billion dollar company now he's sitting here next to me and we're working on the next thing from from scratch it's like what can I learn from this guy I was like how did you guys get that idea and basically what he told me was a kind of interesting story Jack to your point about procrastination he was like two things happen he's like the first was when I joined I wasn't the co-founder or the CTO I joined as like an engineer and he's really good he he's he's he's like obviously amazing and so right away they were like hey we think we have the wrong team like we have too many people here it's gonna we don't we don't have product Market fit we just have too many people which is a great like CEO move Sean was the Wii even uh app Lov or was it some other idea they were doing clothing business it was like style page they're they're trying to make a a Pinterest competitor at the time that was like one of the many ideas so basically they were I think they were a dating thing first and then then whatever so there was like uh they had like 10 or 12 people he joined and the CEO Adam who's proven to be like a pretty like killer guy was like Hey like we don't know what we're doing but we do know that this probably not the right team can you just basically like restart this he's like so just anybody who you don't think is like the like hardcore just down to figure this out let's get rid of them and let's go leaner and let's figure this out so first thing they do they fire everybody right it's like not what you would consider to be like the the origin story of a of a$ 30 billion company then now they have like four or five people so three co-founders plus Fon as the fourth co-founder and I think maybe one other guy and they are like cycling through ideas and so the founders previously had made like 40 or 50 million bucks doing a um I think like a dating like it was an ad network but I think for dating sites and so that's what they knew they knew ad networks but it was like for you know generation one of the web and they had money to fund this I think put $4 million into fund the thing and then they were like we're going to create the next Pinterest they saw Pinterest getting hot so they tried to create a Pinterest competitor then they're like dude we're just like four like non- stylish dudes trying to do this this is not working then they created like this life 360 type of app and they they created like eight or nine ideas and I was like so what was it like you were going in there you're brainstorming every day you're doing research like what was it no not really like basically one person would come in with some inspiration like hey I saw this this is crushing it or you ever noticed this problem and then we would quickly try to build little prototype take it to Market see what happened see if it stuck see if it like got momentum he's like but more often than not he's like honestly like I don't know like 20 to 30% of the days we would just come in we just weren't inspired and we weren't going to work on something that we didn't feel inspired by so we would just play FIFA for like five hours and then we would all go home I was like what he's like yeah we would literally if we just didn't feel it like if the idea wasn't solid that we we didn't feel like there was something there we didn't want to busy ourselves and like occupy ourselves with a not good idea because then that would at least it's like dating somebody bad you don't have the door open to meet somebody amazing and so he's like we would just play FIFA and he's like while we're playing FIFA we would just talk then we would order food then we would talk some more and we're just giving ourselves like relax the brain to try to come up with ideas he's like then uh Adam went to a conference and this was like right when like iPhone had like you know take taken off and he's like came home he's like forget it we're doing an ad network but for mobile phones he's like mobile phones are going to be big they don't really have good ad networks I know how to do an ad Network that's what we're doing and he's like because they knew that business he's like he knew EXA he told me exactly what to build it was like this is a dashboard that I need this is how this product is going to work this is the speed that you need to serve the ad in and if you can't get it under that speed we got to like figure something else out and they just executed like crazy at that point and uh and it it just took off and they were doing you know hundreds of millions of dollars at that time um very profitably and it was it was amazing I'll tell you one other story that you know kind of shifted my thinking so that was one about not occupying yourself not busying yourself in order to let a good let create some space for maybe a good idea to land the other thing that stood out was uh somewhere along the way Furon to likes to take these like young Engineers under his wing so like he met these guys they were kind of interesting he's like you need to move to Silicon Valley come live on my couch and um he convinced them like just come sleep on my couch don't worry too much let just come out here for a few months and and of course that turned into they just live there permanently uh in San Francisco they ended up getting to YC and we let them work out of our office and you you know you can learn something from anybody these were 20-year-old kids who had never built a business before but I was talking to them and I learned something really important they're working on this idea that had started off really strong what they were doing was they took Bitcoin miners so anybody who had a bunch of GPU space and they were like hey this machine learning AI thing is going to be big this was back in like 2016 maybe 2017 they're like machine learning is going to be big and these gpus are really good at running machine learning jobs so there's Bitcoin miners who have excess capacity because maybe bitcoin price would go down then they it wasn't profitable to mine or they just bought out extra and they were like wanted something more steady and he was like he post on Reddit he was like Hey if you have EXs gpus if you're a minor you have EXs gpus listed on our Network and we will get machine learning customers for you to to run jobs almost like a AWS competitor crazy and overnight like they got like so much supply of gpus it was insane like there like thousands of submissions and one day people were super excited the Reddit comments were like oh this is amazing let me know how I can help like calling him finding his phone number and calling him and I was like wow this is kind of incredible and then what happened was a a few months later he was kind of down on the idea and I was like what happened he goes well the supply side was amazing it was like I stepped on a landmine it just blew up and he's like but the demand side doesn't have that same effect he's like but because I felt it over here I kind of realized like what true demand looks like and I remember thinking like damn I have never felt that landmine effect at that time just never felt it I didn't feel that market pull that you were talking about if you don't know it you kind of talk yourself into like maybe I have it maybe maybe this is there are signals of demand and there's the difference between like maybe it's there versus holy [ __ ] we found something and I wouldn't say you have to have a holy [ __ ] you found something thing right away but just seeing that in those guys kind of taught me oh there what I thought was level 10 of what demand looks like for a business for a new startup it was actually level six and level 10 is what these guys experience where you have like a Half Baked Google form and still people are like prepaying you for the service type of thing oh okay that's what 10 looks like now at least I know what that looks like uh that's what a great Market looks like and what I have right now is a lukewarm Market which is why I ended up having like a lukewarm you know success out of that business re really hot to find that 10 out of 10 Market but yeah that is what we had and I think as Mark hre says if if you find that 10 out of 10 Market which kind of a unicorn right that the amazing Market will pull the right product out of the company like right so for us we just identified mobile apps as the market that was amazing but we actually tried out six different business ideas like we created landing pages for each in the space of something like two three weeks we iterated on six ideas and the right idea um the market pulled it out of us d That's so good I love hearing these stories um Jack I love seeing you yeah great to see you thank you wait before we go Jack do you have a book recommendation for me last time you you came on here you talked about the guy who unschooled himself or was unschooled as a kid I thought that was a really cool book do you have any any new book recommendations for me yeah one that I read that um actually you could read it in like an hour or so and then for you guys might find interesting because we just talked about coming up with the business idea right and this I think actually is more helpful at our stage of life where you maybe have one success and many Founders who've sold their company have a midlife crisis they don't know what to work on next and this book is by deepack Chopra and it's called um the seven spiritual rules of success and I thought was really interesting so it's basically saying that his theory if you like he's saying everyone is put on Earth for to fulfill some purpose and everyone has like a unique skill or skills and attributes that they can uniquely use to kind of serve the rest of society and he's like you have found your goal when you blend your talent with service to others and I thought was really interesting and actually maybe just you know if you're a hammer everything looks like a nail I had just read Tony robbins's uh book but I did actually feel like Tony Robbins is perhaps the ultimate embodiment of that was I I didn't know this but Tony then found he had like a tumor on his brain that has made his body release like loads of human growth hormone and so basically that's why he's six foot seven he has he's just a massive giant growth spurt but he also feels like he has abundant energy and he's kind of using that unique attribute that it's very rare to have this tumor on the brain like the doctor told him dude you should act on this and get rid of it but there's a risk you might then get lower energy it's like dude I'm not I'm not having surgery then because this is my unique thing the Abundant energy and he uses that to do these 15h hour whatever camon ARS so that's his thing that's unique to the world and in his kind of serving Humanity in his own way it seems that he's just really passionate about this meals for America so I don't know if he's hit the goal but he was on track to hit donating a billion meals for this feed America thing and during covid he donated like 10 million dollar to help it get through that point so kind of felt like he was a unique embodiment of that um and then even with you guys then as well like um I think uh like when I was talking to like Ben Levy you know Sean you're thinking about what attributes are unique to you that you can kind of uniquely serve the world and and so that book I found was interesting and a quick read what do you think that is for you well for me uh I think it is where I've naturally ended up doing this digital detox whatever Center place because I have the capital to do it like um I'm meeting a lot of people trying to do physical projects and then they just fail because of fundraising and capital and stuff so I think I have the capital and I have the experience of experiencing burnout and I'm just uniquely passionate I've been to this place in in barley like 10 they basically like do this is your second home like you come here so much so I just you have that unique insight about that how this can help humanity and that's maybe why I'm driving the project and I'm doing it for kind of helping Humanity not profit is number one so I feel that I kind of just naturally have uh through reflection and Etc arrived at this place um deepat choas said the way to find your unique purpose if you're struggling he said it comes to you in the space between your thoughts and he said like which is maybe not hard to action but he's like you if you what if you're really struggling to find your purpose Etc you should spend more time in nature and just in a quiet environment and just uh feel and it will it will come to you but I kind of feel that yeah for me it's kind of organically I'd been thinking about this for many years and arrived at this place that's cool man I'll check that book out thank you dude we appreciate you doing this abut you're the best and um that's it that's the [Music] pod for

so in 1929 there's this guy and he starts this company where it's very odd he basically is cleaning the rags and uniforms for circus performers very strange start but that's how this company starts and he turns that into a business and he calls it Acme industrial laundry and he kind of scales that up but not a lot it's a very small business but he scales it up to where he starts doing laundry for other uniform businesses now he started that in 19 29 by 1960 his son who's in like 21 years old comes into the business and he's like hey Dad I would love to work for you and maybe take this over one day and the dad's like yeah sure let's do it and it does okay but inevitably there's a little little argument between the father and the son and so the father calls the son into the office and he's like hey look man this isn't working and the son's totally expecting him to be like uh you know you're fired you're out and the dad goes look this isn't working here's the keys man you run it let's see what you can do I'll step out your way let's see if you could pull this off and so this son he's at the time 21 22 23 years old his name's Richard he takes control of this business and he's like let's grow this sucker and so in 1960 when he takes it over it's doing $180,000 in Revenue which is something like $2 million today has 12 employees and he's like look we're going to like focus on doing laundry for uh companies who need cleaning supplies so like extra Rags they're basically just washing rags and he grows it and it works out well and he grows it to the point where after I think eight years the business grows from $200,000 a year up to $1.6 million a year which is the equivalent of like 15 million bucks a year he's growing this business and it's a he's now expanded into laundering company uniforms which is a very strange thing to get into I didn't even know that existed but he grows this sucker for the next 50 years and now they've renamed a company to Cintas have you heard of centas yeah I see their trucks I see their trucks all the time too and I'd have no idea okay so do me a favor go to cintus market cap just Google that and look at what it says 75 billion it's a 75 billion doll company and their main business is still La uh now they they launder uniforms but they also Supply the uniforms so they make uniforms for all types of businesses you know like you'll see like if you see like a typical janitor out that's a very easy one but it could be restaurants it could be anything and then they uh rent to you your uniform and they'll launder it for you but then they've expanded so like if there's a fire extinguisher in the bathroom of a restaurant it probably has come from them if there's cleaning supplies it probably comes from them because once they made inroads into a business they're like hey along with your uniform we're going to sell you all these other things and so I think they do something like eight or n billion dollars uh a year in revenue and it's subscription Revenue so it's like a huge company why is it subscription Revenue it's uniform rental oh nice yeah they got you uh it's called Ras uh you know like rental as a service I don't know it's just that's just what they do uh they they sell uniforms or they rent uniforms and so they're able to get like these subscription businesses and then it's also like real recurring Revenue because uh they'll sell you all this other stuff and they've got inroads but as the business was taking off Richard farmer uh his name uh he starts getting old and he's like I need to figure out a way how to like keep this within my family and so to this day the family the farmer family still owns something like 20% I think maybe 18% of the business and like he was like I made it my mission to create this like generational thing and I've trained my children to help take this over and to make decisions as as it comes to uh giving away our money but also governing the the the company I don't a family member isn't the CEO but they're still like involved and so the reason why I look this guy up is I'm very fascinated with how you could pull this off where you could keep your family in the business I think that it's very hard and it's high risk High reward and so I've been like studying all these families who have pulled it off and these guys have and from the outside there's a dozen other examples of people who have crashed and burned and this has not worked my question to you is this a thing that you aspire to have all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

Sam ens school.com one of the oddest people you'll ever have a conversation with but odd in the best possible way one time I was with him it was my wife me and Sam oven we're at a party or something it gets to a l in the conversation where there's probably a 5-second silence where we're thinking about what we're going to say next and he looks at my wife and he goes I delivered my baby and we both look at each other and like what he goes I delivered my baby with what he goes uh my hands and then he goes on to tell the story about how his wife gave birth at home because it couldn't make it to the hospital but like he didn't laugh when he was telling any of that stuff and I thought it was so funny and he's one of the quirkiest people I've ever met but he's the type of people who I love where he's so logical that it's painful a little bit but also he's the type of guy who I think has read a book on how like normal people interact and you could tell he's like I do care about you but I kind of have to learn a little bit how to adapt and you could tell that and it's endearing it makes me love him more he's listening to you he's like I am active listening yeah

all right I got a great question in my inbox this morning and it is from a guy named Tony L so he says Uncle Shan I love the nickname by the way Uncle Sean I'm leaning into that he said uh if you were starting from scratch building an audience again from zero today 2024 if you're starting again from zero how would you do it what advice would you give somebody like me who wants to be a content creator but has zero followers today Tony from Miami all right Tony I got an answer for you [Music] so first I got to flash my badge I'm like an FBI officer who walks into the room and I got to show you my credentials if you're going to take me seriously so I've built a you know email following of over 500,000 subscribers I've built a Twitter following of 400,000 Plus on YouTube I think I have 500,000 plus subscribers this podcast has done over a 100 million downloads in the last four or five years so that's all in a four-year time span one University block and all of that has happened and I've learned some things and what I'm not going to do today is I'm not going to give you either a generic advice like you got to be consistent and just be yourself right like okay sure but not very helpful obvious and not helpful uh so I'm going to share the counterintuitive things I've learned I wrote down nine so nine counterintuitive surprising things that I've learned I'm also not going to give you some generic one-size fits all advice I hate when people do this especially this sort of uh YouTube GW economy of of like here's the answer as if there is such a simple formulaic answer that you could follow that anybody could follow right it's very personal and there's Art and Science is a blend it's nothing is guaranteed but I will share with you the wisdom that I wish I had when I was starting from scratch four or five years ago versus today knowing what I know now what is the wisdom that was surprising nonobvious that um I wish I could have just drilled into my brain then and if you're starting today you could take this now I'd also like to say that there are many ways to peel the banana and all I know is the way that I do it maybe other people do it a different way they have had success but I can only share with you what's worked for me and how I think about it and you can choose if that fits for you if that resonates or not all right so here's the nine non-obvious lessons I've had building a big ass audience number one forget the numbers you want to focus on who follows you not how many people follow you Tim Ferris once said something that really stuck in my head he says okay thought experiment would you rather have 100,000 Americans picked at random from across the country be chosen to read your book or have every member of Davos read your book and love your work obviously you'd pick Davos right you'd pick the higher value higher signal group of people this is a a general principle that I buy into which is that more important than how many people follow you is who follows you because the content you put out is who you're going to attract and this is hard to do this is surprisingly hard to do the first reason is because the platforms shove the numbers in your face especially a platform like YouTube where not only do you see how many views every video gets all your audience members see how many views every video gets and you know that they're going to see it so it is very hard to block that out podcasting a little bit easier not everybody can see how many downloads of podcast gets only you can see it but every platform has some version of this Instagram Twitter whatever your your platform is it is very very easy to start to chase the number so the bad news is it's hard to resist that the good news is it's hard for everybody else to resist that in fact they won't even try everybody else will fall into this trap and so it is actually a competitive advantage to completely ignore the numbers at the beginning and focus more on attracting the right types of people to your content who are you actually trying to trying to uh attract like I got a buddy he manages Hollywood Talent so when he writes a newsletter it doesn't matter if there's a 100,000 people reading it or a thousand as long as the thousand people who read it are the right people they're people that either need his service or they're people that are like him agents in the game Talent managers that are very high signal and will become his future Professional Network right I'll use a car analogy as well which is dangerous because I'm probably the one guy on Earth who knows nothing about cars doesn't care about cars but I dabble so General Motors sells 2 and a half million cars a year and is a like 50 billion is dollar company Ferrari only sells 13,000 cars 200 times less right 200 times fewer customers less reach but is at $80 billion company so almost double the value and so how is that possible where you can have 200 thou 200 times less reach yet still be more valuable and it's because Ferrari chose to be luxury they chose to sell to higher-end customers One customer for them is worth 200 for a average car company that's why they have much thicker profit margins and so on and so forth and there's a principle there which is attracting the right customer one of the right customer is worth I don't know a 100 random or non-correct customers for you and I use Customer because in content whether it's a viewer a reader a follower they customers of yours you're producing a product they're consuming it let's call that a customer um so Point number one quality matter matters much more than quantity you might think you believe that but watch 95% of your attention will go towards your follower accounts your view accounts and all that other stuff resist this okay lesson number two what should I talk about my trainer uh who I work out with every morning he's got these great phrases and one of his great phrases is the best product is just you push out to the world and basically like if I just turned you inside out and the whole world got to see what you are all about what you stand for that if you could just productize that this is me pushed out to the world that is the best product why because no one can compete with you at being you if you truly just take your desires your interests your tastes your opinions and you package that and productize that properly you are in a market of one nobody else can match your taste palette nobody else can match your set of experiences prior experiences and stories and and nobody can match your delivery style as as well as your opinions and so the core thing you could do if you really want to be great and separate yourself in the content game is make the product you pushed out I call this finding your inner nerd so quick story I remember going when I was younger to my uncle's house and we get to his house and he's like hey you want to see something and he takes me down to the basement and he shows me flicks on the light and he shows me this elaborate model train set that he has been working on for years like five years plus and it had all these little like the scenery the trees and the trains and it was I mean it was incredible and he's showing me this proudly he's beaming he's smiling and in my head I'm trying to smile back but I'm like wow my uncle is the biggest dork in the world but in the content game you want to be like my uncle you want to Unleash Your Inner nerd you want to go go go down the basement and show everybody that train set that you've been tinkering with for a long time why is this well because the things that you nerd out about are the things that you know the most about it's the nuance indepth detailed overthe toop passionate obsessed that actually turns into great content you see this by the way on platforms like Tik Tok you'll see a guy who's a tomato farmer and he's like all about tomatoes this guy thinks about tomatoes more than anybody in my city has thought about tomatoes and so that guy's got an obsession and an inner nerdom about tomatoes and the reality is that the internet is a geography vaporizer so let's take me for example if I just took my set of inner nerdy obsession sessions it's like oh man I really love on one hand I love startups and building companies and I'm I love going and reading old stories about how the PayPal Mafia and leaked email transactions about how Zuck bought Instagram that's my I love that that's my Netflix right but then I also like basketball and I also like trashy reality TV I I like a bunch of different things now if I walked outside my neighborhood growing up and I tried to find somebody who had the same interest as me zero right there would be nobody who has the same set of weird obsessions as I do even if I took one of them like I like basketball but I don't just like basketball I freaking love basketball I'm obsessed with basketball and there weren't really many people growing up that were as obsessed with basketball as I was they didn't find the jokes as funny they didn't find the the nerdy ex's and O stuff as interesting as I did the internet vaporizes all of that on the internet you go on there you will find your tribe you will find the 10,000 people in the world that are as weirdly obsessed about a single subject as you are right and um that's what works and so there are people who do this there's a guy on Twitter I love die workware this guy just loves men's fashion and he will think about talk about and obsess about you know how long a pant leg should be on a men's suit something that I don't personally care that much about but he does and he has found his tribe online that's what you want to do with content on the internet you want to find your tribe by unleashing your inner nerd uh you get gets rid of competition and also by the way the secret here it makes success a guarantee what do I mean by this normally if you come to me and you said hey I want to build a big following uh you know winning to me is becoming Famous online nobody really says this but that's what we all want winning to me is having a huge audience well if that's your only definition of winning you will almost certainly fail and even if you succeed you will feel like a failure for many years probably before that ever happens that's a pretty miserable thing like 1% odds of success if ever and in that 1% it still takes years so every day you're going to feel like a failure however when you Unleash Your Inner nerd the benefit is you're just reading about stuff you're really interested in you're talking to people who are you know experts at the thing you really love you are learning packaging up what you learned and you're sharing it with the world and you're just really into that stuff and so every day feels like a win because you are talking about the things you are most interested in which just lights you up and so you shift the odds of success to maybe 1% maybe many years down the road to every day 100% of the time I like those odds okay lesson number three build a magnet not an audience everybody wants to build an audience I think that's the wrong way of thinking about it the way I think about it is I am building a magnet a giant magnet that will attract like-minded people into my life so every blog every podcast every video it's a Honeypot and I'm just trying to trap like-minded people into coming into my Orbit and then I get to know them I get to meet them and they start to um share things with me that you know they know that I like because we're like-minded and this has led to incredible deals you know for my business it's led to incredible friendships for me it's led to a faster rate of learning because people will start to send me stuff they know that I like and so I'm trying to build a magnet to bring people to me not an audience okay next one back in the category of what do I actually talk about there's an exercise that I'll give you this is probably one of the only tactical things that I'm going to say like a everybody can literally go write this down and do this and it will make your content better and again I'm trying not to go super prescriptive because everyone's got their own voice you might like LinkedIn and another guy likes podcasting you can win there's a million different ways to win I'm giving you the Timeless principles and hard-earned wisdom but one tactical thing I will give you is an exercise you can do and I call it first last best worst weirdest five questions first last best worst weirdest stole this from Matthew dicks um I added the weirdest one he did the the other stuff first last best works so what you do is you take any subject in your life like jobs you say first job last job best job worst job weirdest job and in each you'll just immediately come up with things my first job was I used to um coach basketball at a school for autistic and Asbergers kids cool my last job that I had was working at twitch my uh worst job was when I created I I built a sushi restaurant and every day my hands were like covered in tuna my weirdest job was when I worked for this psycho billionaire in Indonesia who um too many stories to tell there but that guy so everybody has a version of and you could do that with relationships what's your first relationship your last relationship your weirdest relationship your best relationship your worst relationship you so you can do this with jobs relationships you can do this with side hustles projects whatever and that will create just this huge pipeline of personal stories that you can tell because most people when I say all right what what do you got what's your content they have like one or two ideas it's like you should be idea Rich time poor maybe but idea rich and the way to get idea rich is a very simple exercise first last best worst weirdest and then you plug in different subjects and you'll suddenly be sitting in front of 200 personal stories that only you can tell and then you basically Circle the ones that you think have the most juice and then you that turns into content for you all right next one a thing I wish I knew earlier the 5Ds so a lot of people want to be famous but I have learned over time that is the wrong goal Fame itself kind of annoying but there's something to it right like I don't think I want to be famous but I do want people to know me well what is that well I don't want to be well-known I want to be known well so what does it to know somebody well that's an interesting question I think it's you know their personal stories like I just said their hopes their dreams their fears their obsessions they quirks uh that's what that's what goes into actually feeling like you you're known well and when somebody feels like they know you well they feel connected to you when they're connected to you that's when they subscribe to you that's when they pay for you that's when they show up to your Live Events and sell out Arenas that is how you build a truly powerful audience so the 5Ds what are they the first D done what have I done what's my track record you should know that about me um that's a goal you should have as a creator that your audience should know what you've done they should know what you deliver meaning what do you offer people who follow you for example this podcast on this podcast I offer uh interesting business ideas so opportunities Trends business ideas uh business breakdowns I'll tell you about businesses you haven't heard of that are interesting that are either just cash flow monsters or you know they could be billion dooll companies in the future um I'll tell you about those I teach you about those and the last one is Frameworks ideas much like this podcast here I am telling you a a way that I think about things that might be useful to you bring you Clarity um and bring you hopefully more success so that's what I deliver what do you deliver the third D do what do I do for work and what do I do for fun I want you to know that fourth dreams what am I shooting for what's my goal right if I said Gary Vee a very popular person who is very wellknown but also known well Gary Vee wants to buy the Jets if you've ever followed Gary ve you probably know that Gary ve wants to buy the Jets and um that's his dream and by the way it's such a good dream so smart of him because a it's aspirational it's relatable wanting to buy own a sports team it tells you about him he grew up a miserable Jets fan it's also likable he didn't say I want to buy the Yankees which is like oh yeah of course everybody wants to buy the Yankees he's saying I want to buy the loser franchise for my hometown and I want to help turn them around that's an admirable sort of like Underdog Underdog way of saying something that's kind of douchy in reality which is I want to be so rich I could buy a sports team so anyways you should tell people your dreams and the fifth one dork out out what are you really into what are what are you a nerd about what do you collect that's what you people should know about you so the 5Ds this gives you two wins your audience feels more connected to you but also you get luckier it's weird I said that right luckier yeah that was a surprise to me too there's a certain type of luck where when people know you really well and they find something that they know you will find valuable or you could help them with they will reach out to you and it's almost like you were out there searching for it but you never had to leave your room uh the analogy here came from Nal that I really loved which was imagine you are known well you are known well you are known to be somebody who loves diving deep sea for treasures and you were the best at this and you have done it several times you've shared your stories well when somebody on the other side of the world finds a hidden treasure buried deep in the ocean you will be their first phone call because luck will find you in that scenario and so that's uh something that comes out of the 5Ds okay this is getting kind of long right but you're still here that's weird well that's because there's another important principle which is there's no such thing as too long only too boring so if you bounce find out it's because I'm telling you things that you don't find interesting you don't find insightful um or you don't find novel but if you're still here you listen to one guy on a monologue for this long you can literally hear my mouth drying up it's because I'm telling you things that are insightful that are entertaining and that are um useful to you so there's no such thing as too long only too boring next one I think I'm on seven um don't worry about writing style or production quality if you're doing audio video the goal is not C minus content with a plus plus production it's A+ content with C minus delivery that's the starting point you should be going for that's the first Milestone of success I do not waste hours on packaging um or or perfecting my setup if you go look at the early versions of this podcast it's me in a bedroom with shitty headphones and shitty audio and literally the very first version of this I had like one airpod in like it was bad right go look at Joe Rogan's first podcast here's a screenshot of it if you're on YouTube you can see it um you know it's literally Joe with a fuzzy webcam there's literally like a snowflakes like trippy effect on the screen like which is like so obnoxious there's a giant rainbow background behind him like today Joe's the king of podcast he's got a custom Studio but back then he didn't worry about all that he first conquered content then conquered packaging I see a lot of people get this wrong because they go look at people who are 10 years into the game and they think oh that's how my [ __ ] needs to look no no no first nail content when you're confident you've nailed content then start leveling up your production number eight create a binge bank so at the beginning your numbers are going to be small mine were also small everybody's numbers are small at the beginning that is now normal natural and pretty much unavoidable it is very natural to start thinking at that point man what's the point of even doing this right nobody's even going to see this my last video got eight views you cannot think about the eight views it will demoralize you it will kill your momentum that you need to build up instead the trick here is convince yourself no no no forget the eight views that's not what this is about I am building my binge bank so a binge bank is like your own personal Netflix binge worthy show it's an hour or two of your content that if somebody was interested they could go click the button consume it and be like man I'm a huge fan of this person that's the goal create an hour or two of content that if somebody ever ever got there and of course they will why would they not you're you're awesome eventually people will show up that when they do that in an hour or two they'll walk away being like wow I love this guy this guy's awesome um so that's a trick to overcome the chicken and egg problem of having an empty room at the beginning is no no no forget the empty room I'm building my binge bank right now the last last two I'll give you here people don't want information they want a feeling what does this mean so I think of any channel I create as a little shop in the world's most crowded flea market because that's what social media is it's probably the most competitive market on Earth more more competitive than the dating market right because there's billions of people on social media every day fighting for attention if you're going to be in that market you have to know what you're selling you're not selling things you are selling a feeling David Blaine when he creates his show he's not selling magic tricks he's selling the feeling of awe James Clear who talks about habits he's not selling habits he's feeling he's selling a feeling of self-control a feeling of hope that I can actually turn my life around through dis habit stuff the UFC Dana White once said I don't I don't sell fights I sell holy [ __ ] moments out live on pay-per-view I love that uh Tony Robbins he sells a feeling of motivation CrossFit they they sell a feeling of a satisfying sweat and if you give people a feeling once or twice maybe they'll give you a follow but if you give it to him every day for several years you have a lifelong fan and uh I figured out what I wanted to sell which was inspiration and I try to do it consistently meaning I want you when you listen to me you're going to be inspired either by a success story I tell you about about overcoming failure story about a personal story where I did one of those two things or I'm going to sell you inspiration around ideas like hey I think this can work or I think this tactic can work and you will feel inspired to go take action that's what I try to sell why because that's the feeling I like so that's why I try to give other people and last one my bonus one be so good they can't ignore you I have had the fortune of becoming friends with Mr Beast over the last few years and if there's someone you want to learn content from it's Mr Beast it's the number one most watched YouTuber in the world and I love his attitude towards content here's the advice that Mr Beast gives whenever somebody asks him about how to be a successful YouTuber he tells them go make a 100 videos and every video at on the 100 I want you to think of one thing you're going to do better than the last video maybe it's your hook maybe it's your title maybe it's your thumbnail maybe it's the storytelling maybe it's the editing Pace whatever doesn't matter what it is 100 videos improve each one try to make one be conscious about making one thing better each time I love this advice I love it for two reasons number one it's true and extremely useful advice but more importantly it just shes people away because what they come to for is the secret sauce the answer and what he gives them in said is the path here's the way he teaches them to fish it immediately filters people out he says that like you know 99% of people when he tells them that he never hears from them again they never go to it so it kind of filters out the unserious people and there's a lot of unserious people in this life and the serious people it also works for them it shes them away too because by the time they do the 100 improving one thing each time they don't need his advice anymore by the 100th one they've got it it's working it's cranking they're so busy they forgot about Mr Beast so that's why that is golden advice I'm doing that right now so this content that I'm telling you right now is something I wrote on a new content series that I'm doing so four years ago I started this podcast my first million I did it by myself I interviewed my friend suly as the first episode and I just told myself I was going to try to do 50 of these episodes and I said I'm going to do 50 I'm trying to make one thing better every time similar philosophy I I used 50 at the time fast forward four years I've just started my first new content project since then which is a email Series so if you go to shanp perry.com you can see it you get to watch me do my 100 reps this is now rep number four all the content that I'm telling you today is something I just sent out in my email to everybody who's on that list so if you like this type of content go to sha.com subscribe to it and you get to see me do these reps in public and you'll get more content like this if this is what flots your boat so I have a new content series where I'm like uh people email me and I publish the email chain so basically fans email me questions and I answer them and sometimes I email friends so like interesting people maybe an expert on the election or an expert on um whatever or like we're doing one with LeBron james' trainer of you know say he's been training LeBron James since he was 19 20 years old and for 20 years he's been his personal trainer so we're doing a series with him where we email back and forth and we publish publish the whole chain for anybody to read it's really great it's kind of like the uh like the banter of a podcast cuz two people going back and forth but it's the ease and readability of a blog post so that's my my sales pitch for it but my Approach To That to making that successful is exactly the same I'm going to do a 100 reps and every single week you will notice I I pick one or two things and I'm actually going to publish what is the one thing I focused on making better this week I'm going to publish that so that anybody can see it that is how I'm going to make that series great or I'm going to figure out that hey this is not for me but either way that is the correct approach to giving myself a chance of greatness and that's what you should do for yourself the other thing I love that Mr B says is he goes a lot of people I hear them say oh man I yeah I'm trying my hardest I'm doing great but you know the algorithm I just can't you know I have to do all this stuff the algorithm doesn't like it the algorithm is not serving my video he says anytime you blame you say the word algorithm just switch it with the word people because you're blaming the algorithm the algorithm didn't like my video no no no people didn't like your video the algorithm is just simply giving people videos they like if the algorithm is not giving them their video it's because they didn't like your video I think that's a very useful thing to know which is it's a skill issue it is in your control to make your content better to be so good that they can't ignore you all right I hope that's helpful if you like this uh type of content let me know in the comments here on YouTube and please go subscribe to my new email series it's called Good Friday it's stuff like this so if this was really inspiring to you if this felt actionable felt insightful felt fun to listen to um check it out uh at shanp por.com I'll put the link in the description below and you can just type your email in And subscribe there's a little fun animation when you do it check it out Good Friday that's the the email series by the way why did I call a good Friday because I KN I noticed that most email newsletters are sent on Mondays Tuesday Wednesdays whatever nobody sends emails on Friday because most people hate getting emails on Friday but for me I thought about this way what is the one good email I could send to somebody on Friday well it's a little bit of brain food something that is both entertaining and insightful that you could have going into the weekend it's that one good email on Friday and that's what I committed to I'm going to send a good ass email every Friday for the next 100 uh next 100 Friday so we'll see how that goes check it out and and uh thank you for tuning in [Music]

one last question for you you're a runner one of the things that they were talking about was yeah I had to recover from that 100 meter thing to be ready for the 200 or whatever like no all is talking about this I understand that in theory but also this is a 10-second race is that really hard to recover from it is here's why to run a race at a big Championship you have to run three races one Sprint race is actually three so the quarter semi race the semi and the final are usually always on the same day so that final happened same day as the semi-final so he had ran that morning as well and when you run sprints it taxes your central nervous system which is different it's sort of like hey you have to do this box jump squat 20 times in a row and you got to go for Max height you're going to be this type of sore you feel like your nerves hurt not necessarily like your Aerobic System

dude you you did that school deal right yeah no the school deal is going exceptionally well um we've you know five or Sixx the business in the last eight months break it down why do that deal it seems like you made a much bigger bet and I'm saying that because you started wearing the hat around whereas your other deals you don't promote so I'm like okay he definitely like ponied up for this one and made a big bet on this so why do a SAS deal or you know why why do the school deal how how did you figure out the BET size and and was it like a butt butt clenching number and then what's the plan well I'll say this so breaking down to the into into the deal components any brand endorsement for me is by far the butt clenching component of it not the cash because you only have three four brand bullets that you can use where you're going to promote without becoming a shell right and so if I looked at my audience I think about the people who best monetize an audience do percentage conversion times LTV that's it so what percentage your audience you convert and what's the lifetime gross profit per customer and that's that's it that's the math the person who makes the most money wins and so the the big thing that I saw with my audience is that obviously we have a a very skewed you know monetization structure because we have portfolio companies where we just make a tremendous amount on like a handful uh and then everything else like kind of doesn't matter um and do you even promote you don't even promote those others right no I don't no no the other no not at all that's just but they come inbound though so that's it still comes from content often um I'll let's put a pin in that because I have a whole bunch on Deal gen that I think you might find interesting but a huge percentage of my audience are people who want to start a business and that's probably some of the people who listen to your stuff they're people who are employees they're high up they're Executives things like that or and they or they want to start a business with their own whatever and so I was like okay so there's this entire huge part of my audience that wants to start a business and I want to have something for them and so I also don't want it to cannibalize acquisition. comom in terms of how we generate deals or things like that and so uh it had to be something that would help people start a business which in my opinion was going to be the closest match you like audience match so highest percentage conversion um it had to be a scalable thing so I didn't think a service would work given the amount of volume that we have and so it's was like okay it has to be something that's uh demand constraint not supply constraint so it's like okay and ideally if there's something that we can create some sort of network artifact um and some sort of compounding machine within it and it has to be at the right point in the life cycle of the business right if you're a da a thousand at Facebook is probably too late you know what I mean to get in on Facebook at any appreciable percentage right um and also where I would have less leverage and less value to add uh to a company of that size and so school was a big company uh in terms of its value and the rounds that they had done already but I also have a really big brand and so it took Sam and I call it nine months to work out kind of every component of the deal uh there is in my opinion it was the best deal I've ever done not in terms of like winning over anything like that it was just it's a it's a really elegant deal the way that it works which I'm not at Liberty to explain all the pieces of it but basically like we both gave a lot and we both are happy with how it's going and so we both made commitments to the other person of what we can and can't do like if if someone's going to come on and uh you know be in an ad from school like I have to be okay with it because I have a strong association with that and things like that right it's like there's how can I M mitigate this risk how can you mitigate that and so to Circle back to the original question why did I do the school deal I felt like I had 70% of the audience that I have because there's always way more people who want to start a business than have a business especially if you make business content and so I wanted to have something for that audience that I that met all those other requirements and I knew Sam um and Sam told me about school two weeks into him starting school and so I was kind of like I'm not going to try and bet on a platform at day one that's why that's where Sam has just massive balls I think on our on our podcast I think he said he I think he said he spent $10 million of his own money to fund the business and I think he also said that was the bulk of all his money yeah it was I mean I think he's been public about it and then he and then he still raised another five to still keep continue to reinvest in the business and when I saw the metrics of school it had everything that you want it had viral organic GL it was compounding you know 20% every single month month over month over month and I was like this thing's a monster and it was right at that point where he's like we need to grow and I was like okay I need a product and so it was a perfect match and um it's worked really well all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

Simone biles and in general gymnastics there's something about gymnastics that just creeps me out dude there's something strange and joyless and she is so dominant there's something uncanny about it's like watching an AI video where you're like this looks beautiful but there's something inhuman about what I'm watching here dude isn't it weird that you're judged in a sport on like your appearance and your smile like I think that's weird I also dislike sports that are mostly judged that always makes me mad also can't tell the level of difficulty they all look absolutely incredible and it's like well no this one was clearly 410 of a point worse than that one and so it is kind of an unwatchable sport also because everything that all the athletes are doing looks super human to me whereas a race it's like that person ran and won I can tell who won and lost in gymnastics I really can't tell who wins and loses at all

there's a great story I think it's ogi who when he launched his agency he's like how do I get people to do this and he basically made a killer offer he was like take your top performing ad that you've spent years iterating on and you got this to be your top performing ad I guarantee that I will beat it in an AB test head-to-head within a month and I'm so confident I will fund the ad cost if I don't beat it in order to win your business and what he said was the response rate on this ad was through the roof but the best part was of the 100% of people that responded he's like we didn't even end up having to do it because the top 20% the most expensive clients were like okay cool forget the AB test and the mechanics and the contract for that the fact that you're willing to do that we looked into your track record we are big Believers in this we'd like to just move forward and and go ahead and Entertain You we know that our agency would never be that confident to pull that up so we're willing to to work with you and he's like it was incredible I used this killer offer to fill up the funnel and then I just picked the top 20% of clients in that funnel and that kickstarted OG which became you know one of the big ad agencies

all right we need to talk about this um the podcast is either going to end today or we're going to figure this out is that dramatic enough for [Music] you okay um Sam can we start can I start with an apology yes can I say sorry I was let me check my notes I was a little pissy yesterday and you were on the receiving end of me being a little pissy we had a a fight an argument a disagreement a lovers quarrel I don't know what you want to call it we had something and I want to talk about it here not just because I'm a sicko and I'm like oh this is good content Jerry Springer but also mostly because I found it I thought about it a lot afterwards I found it kind of fascinating and at first I felt really bad I don't know about you but I felt really horrible the rest the day so without discussing the specifics I want to talk about what I learned after that fight can we do that okay yeah okay so here's the story we got in a fight yesterday and I wouldn't even call it really a fight it's like a every six months there's just disagreements that we had to work through exactly and like most things starts off as a misunderstanding turns into a disagreement which leads to an argument leads to a fight and then it kind of de-escalates into a grumpy agreement and you sort of move on and can I first tell you why I even wanted to talk about this yeah do you know who JJ McCarthy is by any chance he's a a rookie football player he's a quarterback for the Vikings so he's he's a rookie yeah I don't know who he is but I know the name football he just got drafted and like any you know a team that sucks they draft a quarterback they're hoping he's gonna turn the franchise around and he just had their first like preseason game not even in the season yet and he threw an interception while he was playing so after the game he's doing an interview and I I'm scrolling on Twitter and I see this and I'm seeing this after we have our fight and the interviewer asks him she goes JJ you go out there you want to perform well but you know you throw that interception and I'm sure you know that did feel great you know what just talk me through what was going through your mind and how are you feeling after doing that and this guy's response was epic he goes what was going through my mind what an opportunity goes what what an opportunity and he goes yeah I mean this whole my my success in my career is going to be based I'm a quarterback in the NFL my success in my career is going to be based on my resilience my ability to bounce back from mistakes I throw an interception what an opportunity to learn to get better and to improve and I was like whoa [ __ ] mindset alert you know I I pride myself on mindset I am a student of mindset and when I heard that I thought wow that was an uncommon response to a very common situation I would say most guys are down on it but then they'll lie and be like well I just you know next had to focus on the next play just put it out of my head and and you know just just get better you know but they're kind of bitter about it and this guy was so genuine when he said what an opportunity and so I kind of had that same thought where I was feeling bad after our fight and I thought I saw that clip and I thought okay what an opportunity for me to learn here and the reason I think it's an opportunity for me was we joke on this podcast I'm generally super laid-back like I don't really get easily bothered I pride myself and have a good mindset but of course I'm a human being I mess up which is why when I get bothered it's rare and I suck at it and so I wanted to tell you some of the things that I reflected on afterwards I have like five to seven thoughts can I just read them out to you yeah and I I might have a few as well so first one fights don't start as fights and uh what I mean by this is you never start you never start a conversation intending to fight nor do you even really see a fight coming and the way the analogy I was using in my head was like oh a fight is like a forest fire when a forest fire happens the explanation they usually come to is well there was like a bunch of the what do they call it like the dry Bush or whatever like this kind of the Dead sticks that that go on the ground and it's sort of this accumulation this pile of sticks that nobody really clears out and it's not a problem until somebody drops a cigarette on it and it it could be something that you just squish out with your foot right away you put it out there's no big deal but if you don't put it out right away that accumulated dry stuff can catch fire it could become a wildfire it could it could te tear down a whole forest and so that was my first observation was man that the debris on the on the forest floor is kind of like a hidden danger it's a dog that's not barking and you have to make sure that if a cigarette does drop on it you're you're able to kind of immediately put it out or clear it out ahead of time that was the first thought which by the way the reason why that's very easy for you to say that that's very hard to address and the reason it's hard to address is because a lot of times people particularly me and I know you do as well you have this idea where you're like I don't want to ruffle feathers I'll just go with the flow and if you do that too often then you're like [ __ ] I've been going with the flow now I'm bothered and that's a very hard balance to implement of like when do you go with the flow or when do you say that's not my preference right that that describes it to to either avoid confrontation that's one reason to just like Let It Go type of thing but you don't really fully Let It Go right like 10 to 15% linkers or in my case it's it's a lot less of I'm avoided confrontation it's more of I don't want to let myself get bothered by something small so I ignore it I think I ignore it but like 10% of it lingers and if you ignore too many things that 10% can start to add up and if un addressed it's that stuff on the on the forest floor okay so here's the second one fights are natural that was the second thought I had I wrote down in my little diary here fights are natural we've been working together on this podcast for four years I can count probably three serious arguments or disagreements that we've had that felt uncomfortable to deal with maybe there's been some other ones I'm forgetting but like it's understandable you work together with somebody for four years on a project you're going to have disagreements in the moment it doesn't feel good it doesn't feel natural logically you know hey this is normal but in the moment feels bad and let's emphasize how bad like when I argue with you or when I argue with Jordan or Joe my my other partners like it ruins my week I hate that feeling I think you are a little more comfortable with confrontation for people like me like these Midwestern nice people who have been raised to just swall just swallow it you just you live life like resenting others sometimes or like you just don't [ __ ] complain I hate it I hate like there's been times where I've had to fire someone and I won't fire them for a year because I just don't want I just don't want to do that conversation I hate it it bothers like I I like I I wake up in the middle of the night it ruined my night I was going to show you my I'm wearing a Ura ring I was going to show you my sleep score was terrible I slept three hours last night I woke up in the middle of the night at 3: amm and I ate three pieces of cookie dough from like a Nestle's bacon bake whatever it's called break and bake yeah break and bake dude I wish I had a break and bake that would have made me feel better I just woke up feeling shitty and it's it REM like the analogy here is in your diet you can wake up feeling shitty I at least I do this as my like my Evolution from guy with a horrible diet to trying to be better about it is I know when I feel shitty and it's either because I just door dashed Taco Bell and that was just a bad decision and I'm paying the price for that but also even if you do the right thing at the wrong time if I eat a very like a full meal but I ate it at 10:30 it doesn't matter if I had grilled chicken and whatever if it was a healthy meal if I eat too late I'm just going to feel bad right so you could do the right thing at the wrong time and get pain you could do the wrong thing at the wrong time get pain and for me this was surprising because usually if I have a confrontation it's usually a relief because I've been I've been trying to avoid having it and when I do have it I normally quite relieved in this one I felt awful I felt terrible I couldn't sleep it was such an unusual feeling for me which made me think I didn't do it right all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show so that's probably relatable but not surprising I'm going to give you some of the things that I found interesting the first is about this guy named Dr Gman let's call him Dr Gman because I forget his first name do you know who Dr gotman is no Dr Gman is the love doctor literally this is a guy who studied marriages and his claim to fame is that he could watch a couple for 15 minutes having a conversation about something and predict with 90 plus perc certain if they were going to have a div end up divorced or stay together 90 plus% and only watching a 15minute conversation in fact he had something called The Love lab which was his research lab where he would bring couples in he would say talk about X and he knew that X would lead into a little bit of a conversation a little bit of resentment would come up and he could watch how they handled it and in just 15 minutes predict 90% accuracy and by the way if you let just like a normal marriage counselor or an average person on the street watch that same 15 minutes their accuracy was about 50% just like flip a coin they had no no accuracy essentially but this guy had 90% and why is that because he had done this a bunch and he he was able to identify what are the things to look for that would cause a couple to break up and so one interesting thing last night was I went down this Rabbit Hole of like what did Gman say what are these things and he's got uh a couple of interesting very insightful things so he's got one thing called The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse he basically is like I look for four things that if a couple does these four things highly correlated with them not not staying together in the long run low marriage satisfaction and divorce it's like the emotions of contempt uh resentment what were the other two close so it's criticism contempt which was the biggest one defensiveness and stonewalling and some of these were gendered so like men were typically more guilty of stonewalling meaning wife is bringing something up he just kind of shuts down just cuts kind of like in his mind he's like I'm not fighting in her mind it's like you're you're not even you're not even open you're closing me down and I'm trying to express something to you but contemp contempt was the one where regardless of gender if you did these things like an eye roll anything that's hierarchy which is like oh you're such an [ __ ] right I'm good and you're bad anything that creates anything that indicates contempt was like one of the worst things that could happen because it indicates a lack of fundamental respect and you know equality in in the relationship so he's got that he had another one which is a magic ratio which was they would observe an interaction and they would see that and and by the way the way they did this was fascinating couples talk for 15 minutes and he's encoding every minute I think they divided into like 18 signals in a minute or something like that and they had this like specific encoding where it's like eye roll like body language turn away phrasing of a thing yeah but like all these little Nuance things that he because they would they would immediately encode and then they would have a score at the end of it and they'd have positive interactions between the couple and negative but they're like these micro interactions right to the surface it didn't even look like they're having a huge fight yelling at each other throwing screaming you know throwing things across the room none of that but even in just like a normal conversation he could get that indication so he said the magic ratio is five to one right every couple is going to have negative interactions that's not avoidable it's what's the ratio of positive to negative and if it was five to one the couples would stick together uh below 5 to1 you start to get into higher likelihood that the couples will not stay together I thought that was kind of interesting um there's a ton of like little micro things that he has in there like repair attempts so how do you deescalate people who know like any couple that stayed together had a good habit of using humor or taking a break or just saying I'm sorry that was stupid I shouldn't have said that that's not actually what I mean what I mean is this a way to deescalate in in a fight was like a huge tool that was that was very useful and that was one thing I think I did poorly yesterday which was I was not de-escalating well right either could have took a break could have just made a joke could have said actually the way that came out is not actually how I feel how I feel is really this but instead it was like sunk cost like I said it now I got to defend it which is like such a stupid way to go he's got this whole philosophy that I'm super fascinated by now and really excited to do kind of like a little bit more of a deep dive on like how cool is that guy by the way yeah he's great I I joke with my wife where I'll say look I've made my point I am dug in okay there is no retreating here I'm what you call Doug in I cannot go back and the reason I'm raising my voice is because that would mean that if I talk lower it I'm losing the argument right and that is not happening yeah like you know in UFC fights I remember McGregor would always say we'll see who takes the first back step he's like he's like oh we're gonna fight but I'm not he's not just his Trash Talk was not I'm Gonna Knock You Out he's like he would get in their mind like let's see who takes the first back step CU he's actually a counter puncher he wants the guy moving forward so he'd put that in their mind if you take a back step you're a [ __ ] and as silly as that sounds that would describe my behavior in a lot of interactions let's see who takes the first back step which is not serving me well yeah I get in trouble a lot for it and it's incredibly stupid and there's so many times where I'm like [ __ ] I I my ego won't let me retreat but that is the right decision right let me give you a a mechanic that I learned that I wish I had yesterday when we were fighting I once took an improv class in San Francisco and the very first class instead of teaching you how to do improv the very first lesson is not here's what you do it's here's what you do when you screw up because you're going to screw up a ton you are beginners this is hard you are going to screw up a lot so the first tool we give you and they would just go she she was like when you say something that was stupid or didn't make sense or was not funny and you tried to be funny the weight of the world is going to come crashing down on you and here's your solution ready and she's like could you all do that we're likeo and she was like that's it when it happens just go whoop and that just means to everybody clear the Slate that didn't happen we're moving on we're moving past that it was a whoop and I wish I had a mechanic like that in so many more areas of my life where a way to eject or abort or pull out of a tail spin of like I didn't want to go this way I didn't want to say that I didn't want that to come across the way it came across I needed a whoop to just be like that was like let's wipe this late clean real quick like an ET a sketch just quickly shake it and it's gone yeah I uh you would look really dumb if you did that but I agree that is a very that is a very helpful thing I I've got I get in more trouble because of this thing more than anything else right all right another observation my body keeps the score so I have this coach is an executive coach which is like you know business strategy but mostly like therapy thinking through basically helping me think more clearly and be a better person and he's great and he has this he has stuff that he says that's great that I'm like totally it he has other stuff that he says that I'm like I get that you buy it I'm not sure that I buy it yet and one of the things he always talks about is like the body keeps the score have you read that book I've read the book but I you know I don't have back pain and I think it's more of a it's like a literally like a back pain book right it sort of it's basically like uh the easiest one our soldiers who have PTSD uh they see they they feel things physically and I Frank I actually don't remember the entire premise but I believe it was was if you change your body you can actually change your mind right so he'll ask me he'll be like I'll say something he be like where do you feel that when you say I'm like I don't feel like and I I said it from my mouth what are you talking about he's like no like is there a tightness in your chest I'm like bro I don't want to like I don't want to do yoga I just want to say what's going on and then figure it out with a logical solution and he's helping me learned that I hadn't really fully bought in until yesterday when I felt terrible after it physically I felt Terri terrible after our conversation and I was like oh [ __ ] I think he's right I think the body does keep the score and I'm more of a believer in that woooo [ __ ] so that was another observation for but did you feel terrible because you felt that I was wrong or because you didn't like how the words you used I felt terrible because I felt like I did myself a a a a disservice disservice which is I don't think I conducted myself well I thought I actually had a good point meaning I don't disagree with any of my words and I agree with all of my delivery and what a shame because it's like actually what I did was a a total net negative I undermined my own Point what I was trying to express I didn't Express well it wasn't effective and I made you feel not good too because that wouldn't feel good anyways and I was like oh the other lesson of course is people don't remember what you say they just remember how you made them feel if it makes you feel better I I think your delivery wasn't as bad as you think that does make me feel better thank you and I agree and I agree with your points like the points you made were not not bad points you're the problem with having an argument with you is you are quite logical and you do make logical points the other problem with you is that most people myself included are more emotional than logical and that's sometimes hard for you to understand yes and also to give myself a a more blame here is I am like a firecracker or something like that it's like you can play with it you can hold it nothing's going to happen for like 99 out of the day out of all the days of the year 364 days out of the year that firecracker is just easy to easy to handle but on July 4th there's one day that like 5% of the time where the fuse gets lit there is like no no warning and it's [ __ ] explosive and so it's like that's I think my problem is I'm extremely tolerant and unbothered until the moment I'm bothered and then I have a big whiny baby and I like get really upset really quickly more than I should and again and I real what I realized yesterday was oh that's just because I don't have many reps doing it and this is kind of a [ __ ] like my greater strength is I have no weaknesses but it's I think it's honestly true in this situation which is I'm so rarely bothered that when I'm when I am bothered I'm so poor at handling it whereas I think somebody who is more frequently runs into situations like this they come they become more mature and have better tools to deal with it than I do it's almost like because you're pretty emotionally healthy that is actually a weakness you know what I mean because you don't assume that other people are broken or like that their ego dictate things do you know what I mean well I think you're giving me a very generous B but I'll I'll consider that not just a compliment but maybe something that might be true here can I read you a couple more bullet points just words I jotted down in my journal here so there are no winners in war there's always a benefit to expressing myself but uh and finding resolutions when there's a mixup but once it escalates there are only you know there's no there's no winner and loser there's only two losers in a situation like that where I think at a certain point the conversation was productive and at a certain point it was unproductive and once it got into an unproductive and by the way we weren't like cursing each other out or anything I don't mean to make it sound like that but just on a relative scale it wasn't one where I felt wow that was super constructive and I feel better about the relationship it's like no I think we did some damage there and were two there was only two losers in that interaction there was no like winner and loser which is stupid because when you argue you kind of want to be a winner or a lo you want to be a winner and that defaults the other person to being a loser in the interaction but that's a false idea have you read Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People clearly I should go and reread it read the first chapter about people loving their name and then I was like this is great and I like he has a famous line in that where he goes the most beautiful word in the English language is a person's name so say it a lot but like right in the third chapter like one chapter after that he tells a story about how he was with this influential person who was telling him a story and the guy got a lot of the story wrong like he was like saying this is a quote from Shakespeare and Dale was like actually right you know that was Thomas Jefferson who said that uh and the guy who he corrected [ __ ] hated him he's like don't don't correct me over this [ __ ] and the whole point is like when you try to correct people or argue with them to prove a point it doesn't it rarely ever Works your way which sucks because sometimes it makes you feel good to win an argument or to think you wanton an argument but it actually it's more often than not a shitty thing didn't Lincoln also say the same thing like never criticize and I've always had trouble with that idea I think in the book how to INF people was like never criticize I was like never yeah never criticize and I was like never how how do you function with never crit how does that how do you how do you the accountability I don't I don't I still don't understand that like well what he said in that letter or in that chapter was he' also said Lincoln would do this thing where he would write an angry letter to someone and one time he wrote like a scathing letter letter to someone and he didn't send it and the reason why he did that was one time he talked [ __ ] about this guy and the guy was like I challenged you to a duel which was a fight to the death and linoln was like dude I'm not doing that that's insane I'm I'm sorry I didn't mean to offend you I'm sorry and like it was like I'm not g to criticize people ever again and so instead he would write these letters where he would like [ __ ] [ __ ] them out and then just not send them and that he was like that makes me feel better yeah I need to try that I still don't fully understand how you do the never criticized thing but I think they're right which is rarely doesn't do any good um okay let me give you a couple others everybody is the hero of Their Own Story story and convincing them otherwise is a Fool's errand myself included I recently heard this when I was in Canada uh at that uh Andrew Wilkinson's event I was sitting at a dinner table with Chris Sparling Chris's Andrew's business partner who's more under the radar but a super fun guy and he's one of my I don't know top three dinner party guests the guy is just electric at a dinner table and one of the things he said was he he brought this up he goes isn't it funny he's like I have never met a person who does not view themselves as acting I forgot exactly how he said it but like acting good acting just no matter what they're doing and he's like I think everybody from serial killers on views themselves as the hero of their story and uh you know Justified uh either what they did was right or the wrong thing they did was justified he's like isn't that crazy I was like that is actually crazy and it was so true like I felt like when we were arguing yesterday I was the hero of my story and I had done all these Valiant things that were you know um you know my my protagonist moves and then you were like aha but I am the protagonist and I'm like you know in as an escalator like you're the villain I'm the hero and you're like I'm the hero you're the villain and it was like wait we are both idiots is actually what we both are we're neither the heroes nor the villains in this scenario but it was just a a good reminder of man I'm guilty of that if I'm guilty of that everybody's guilty of that and I I looked it up there's something called narrative identity which is like the the psychological name for for this phenomenon that even you know Hitler on believed this about uh about themselves and the problem is that then you go and like you ask your wife or your close friend about any situation and you explain it and often times they'll say you are right but the reality is is like you're not probably you're probably not explaining the situation like to where you can truly get wonderful advice do you know what I mean right well there's another one I looked up when I was when I was talking to chat GPT about like what is the name for this me and my buddy just had this argument what's the name of that syndrome what what is what was I doing and what is that called one of them was called mistaken attribution and what it the principle was this when I'm wrong it's because of the situation when you're wrong it's because of the character and if you do that it's a very unhealthy mindset to have or a bias to have it's a misattribution bias and we all do this which is oh those things that I did the wrong well that's just because that this was what was going on in the situation however if you don't give that same benefit of the doubt to the other person that their actions were situationally dictated and and not from any poor intention then you end up with this the same problem as like in investing it's like when I win it's skill when I lose it's bad luck and in the same way in a fight it's if I'm wrong it's situational if you're wrong it's character it's your you just you that was a choice that's who you are so someone told me this years and years ago and it kind of changed my life and I try to use it all the time and I'm a human and I fail and I I failed on it a little bit uh or I failed on a lot of bit yesterday but basically it's the idea where we judge ourselves on our intentions but we judge other people on their actions right and I try to remind myself constantly and that's really that's another thing that's very simple but hard but it is like very important I think truly and dude during our conversation yesterday was like well you know I didn't there was no Mal intent in this right yes I know that it's like and you I know that you had no Mal intent in what you did right you're like yeah of course well we should have done that but like then what the [ __ ] are we talking about what does this m none of this matters at that point what are you mad about what am I mad about how does this even make how does this even make sense if there's if we both agree that the intentions were correct then we could deescalate this down to oh we just weren't clear about XYZ or oh we had a Mis miscommunication misunderstanding I thought you meant this you thought I meant this oh yeah silly mistake on my part but didn't mean to make that mistake it's just a natural mistake you know because I'm not a perfect person so I think there was a moment in there where we could have de-escalated that we didn't properly do it that's how every argument actually should start that's actually what I'm going to do is like can you explain your intentions and I'll explain my intentions and then we'll break down the actions to see like if there's alignment or whatever right I once argu with my wife and then I had a training session with my trainer right afterwards and you could tell I was like a little off at the beginning like my My Vibe is usually like Good Vibes only and I did not have good vibes only but I was just quiet and he was like what's what what's up and I was like oh yeah you know and I started to explain the situation and he goes oh here I got the solution for you and I thought he was giving me the solution to the argument to the problem the issue quote unquote that we were discussing and he goes no no here's here's what you do when you're in that moment just remember I love you right you love me cool and we want to be happy all right then we're good like he was just like cool then nothing else matters and what he was saying he's like what I mean by that is do you want to be right or do you want to be happy and he's like I have a lot of clients that are like you Silicon Valley types businessmen you know logical left brain thinker types there is a desire to be right and it is sometimes at odds with the actual outcome you want which is happiness Harmony you know cooperation feeling good and if you remember what the thing you want really is you wanted the happiness Harmony cooperation you don't want you want that more than you want to be right you will act totally differently so just remind yourself of that as the argument starts you know it's funny we were talking and we in and 30 minutes in your newborn started crying yeah and when I heard that cry it broke my frame I was like I don't want I don't want him to be upset like you want to like is there any and I wasn't there physically but if I were like is there anything we could do to like make him happy like can we hug in front of him like I remember thinking like I don't want this kid to be upset like that's the only thing that import that that's actually the important thing is like oh he's upset like that that's unacceptable my podcast dads are fighting yeah I remember thinking I'm like oh like let's let's tend it you know what I mean like it totally broke my frame where you're like for some reason making him not cry just for two seconds is significantly more important than any like large business conversation I thought that was like kind of interesting 100% um all right I have a couple more and then we can we can stop you know hugging each other so this I wrote a category what did I learn about myself because I I noticed as a was doing the you know I I my coping mechanism was like o This research is fascinating o this framework is cool I was like all right all right but I'm kind of distancing myself from the cold heart facts of my own behavior and my own mistakes and I want to tell you what I wrote Under what did I learn by myself I said I made the cardinal sin the cardinal sin in any relationship is measuring I remember um once meeting uh this guy Stan chabowski Stan chevoski is a very successful business Facebook and Google uh not Google but Facebook yeah so he first was entrepreneur he created uh him and his buddy James Courier had been business partners for like 20 years and they have like a great business marriage and I was hanging out with Stan once and he was telling me about like what they did with tickle how they stole thatt for like whatever to you know like hundred million dollars just to monster and then they created this other company this other company this other company and then Zuck recruited him and Zuck like recruited him for like 10 years and finally you know he he finally went and worked with Zuck and he ends up running face messenger and he's had an amazing career I said and one of the cool things was when he went to Facebook I was like how did James handle that like now he's doing all the work for that like they're they co-founded nfx this like Fund in this incubator and they are accelerator and they and now you're going and taking a job at Facebook like doesn't that put some stress on the relationship and he was and he kind of laughed and he was like it's not that that's not an issue but like you know we have such a strong partnership that like we it's great and that worked out great and I was like how do you guys do that man I was like because I want to work with somebody for 20 years like that's a when I think about winning what winning looks like in my life that that's what winning looks like uh find somebody amazing just do projects with them for 20 years find a handful of people that I could do that with and um he told me he goes oh the Secret's very simple he goes the first thing is um turn it into a giving contest he said 98% of the relationships you you are in are taking contests meaning you were trying to get out as much as you you're asking what am I getting out of this relationship that's the fundamental like underlying questions what am I getting from this other person what am I getting out of this you don't realize it but you you don't realize it until you get into a tit fortat scenario meaning they didn't do this so I'm also not going to do that they did this to me so I'm also going to do that to them and you get into this tit fortat contest is measuring and basically it makes the pie smaller he goes the beautiful thing about James is that James is constantly trying to figure out how to make our relationship Pi bigger meaning he's just thinking how do I give more to this relationship and he doesn't measure even when I'm not giving as much he just gives he just keeps asking himself how can I give more he goes the beauty is that if you're if you're with somebody who's wired that way and you start to do it too your relationship P grows like crazy and I remember hearing that being like this is the way that is the wisdom that is the fundamental truth about how to do this Tony Robins has a very similar framework around four levels of love one of that he calls the tit fortat thing he calls it whoring he's like I'll give to you if you pay me basically it's like I'll put out for you if you if you put out for me and he's like most of us run around our whole lives whoring um and most of the relationship we have there and and that is the root cause of why you get into these patterns these negative patterns with people because it's in Game Theory terms if every time one person even accidentally short changes the other and then you intentionally Short change back and then they pick up on that and then they Short change back like what are you left with at the bottom very little um but it is very common and I think that was the Cardinal mistake was I was measuring what I was getting instead of focusing on what am I giving and how do I give more because that's just who I am whereas what I was doing was saying how can I give so much because then I'm GNA get back and that's fundamentally like a measuring scenario where instead it should just I wantan I want to roll differently so I think that was the probably the biggest mistake I made I I think is that your list I have one last one but it's a positive one so I'll end on a positive note which is the best relationships are bigger than you so me and my wife used to argue a bunch when we were dating we actually ended up breaking up right before we finally got back together and end up getting married and we broke up cuz I was like dude you're just upset all the time and I don't really know what to do like I'm just being me and like if that upsets you we shouldn't be together and she's like no I'm not upset I'm just I'm like you're upset we're upset a lot we're fighting a lot this is too much I don't want to do that how long were you dating when you broke up and how long did you break up for and then how long until you got married okay I think something like we were probably dating for two years my guess broke up for one month exactly and then got back together and it was it's been amazing ever since in a unbelievable kind of way meaning you know most people are like oh people don't change and if my friend was in a relationship and I'm like okay so y'all were fighting all the time you broke up for a month she got back together and was like no no now I'm going to be cool about everything I'd be like dude come on are you serious what are the odds of that like what are the odds that like it'll just all turn around and then it it actually did and one of the things that I would say it turned around like uh a 180s let like a full turn it turned around like 130 which was great huge Improvement and then when we had kids it's now a full 180 where I told my wife other day I was like dude when's the last time we fought and she's like I I don't know do we have time to fight I was like exactly I was like the best thing about kids is that both you and I have an unspoken agreement which is okay first of all we no longer doubt each other's intentions I know you were trying to be great for me and I'm trying to be great for you and we're not perfect that's okay but second to that is when we do disagree or have an argument we only let ourselves suffer for like 90 seconds whereas you were saying like dude when I have a conversation like that it ruins my week it used to ruin our week then it started to ruin our couple days now it ruins literally 90 seconds but it's like yo we got to be awesome parents and we got to like function we got to go to gymnastics right now it's like are we really going to like make this car ride uncomfortable like dude how about we just agree to this like totally let that go and just get back on the goodfoot we've been doing that now for the last like three or four years and it has been amazing it is a miracle it is something that I would not have believed and if my friend told me yo that's how it's going to go I'd be like um you're bullshitting yourself but I think the principle is the best relationships have something that's bigger than just yourself in it you you can't really be selfish as a parent you know your selfishness goes down when you have kids because it's really about at least for me I should speak for myself life is very much in service of them and I I I I will give up so much I used to never give up for them um and that and I feel like in a way the podcast is great for us because it's something bigger than us like let's say we didn't have the podcast I probably after that last interaction probably wouldn't have talked to you for a few months just out of like well we don't have to talk so why would I talk whereas the podcast is like no I got to make this right which made me think what can I do better which made me grow up and be a little bit of a better person today before you uh put a bow on it let me say one thing so when we have that argument also when I have any argument with anyone in business I like this little thing gets in my head where I'm like I like sometimes I'm like you know what I don't want to do business ever again I don't want to like I don't want confrontation like you know it's like when you're losing a board game and you just like [ __ ] this game and you like flip it up upside down like sometimes I'm like I don't want any of it I'm out I don't want any of this I don't want any drama and the reason I like reading history and biographies is I'm able to see people I admire and like some of the issues that they've had and I think I've said a bunch that like all great men are bad men meaning anyone who you admire like who's achieved greatness whether it's a president or a CEO like there's people who dislike them because they've had to kill like someone like you know like in war but you're like that war was unfortunately good but there's down huge downsides and I think about like to do anything interesting in life whether it's business or whatever it involves confrontation and it involves tension a lot of times that is such an uncomfortable feeling but it's sort of like working out where it's like you got to do that to make your muscle strong but I and I and I hate it when it's happening and I have to remind myself like don't burn it down don't walk away from everything like you can achieve what you want you just have to go through some argument sometimes but it's sort of like when you have let's say you had a company with 100 employees and let's say 26% of those employees are unhappy happy that's like a pretty good ratio so you have roughly 75% of people who are happy but that means that every single day if there's 26 days in the work week or in the month work work days in the month someone's gonna [ __ ] to you do you know what I mean and someone's gonna [ __ ] to you every single day and what it does to you is it makes you think everything is bad and it's really hard to switch your psychology to be like no not everything is bad need to compart compartmentalize these two things and it is a I've gotten better as I've gotten older but it's that is a huge issue uh for me personally and I think it's an issue for a lot of people where they they face some adversity and I typically human adversity like tension between people is I think in my opinion the hardest one and the most common one and the reaction is [ __ ] it yeah I have that reaction I have that reaction super fast I think even thing yesterday I was like forget the whole thing then not the podcast but like the situation where argu I like forget who cares even then I do that all the time I do that all the time and I have to I H it's a really hard thing to say is my future self going to be happy or sad that I made this decision in this particular moment it's really [ __ ] hard to nail that do do you also read the kind of history and biographies because it's like the problem is 100 times bigger than your current problem like whatever the Tiff is with your wife or with your neighbor or whatever it is it's like well I just last night spent four hours reading about these guys who are Shipwrecked and like you one of the Reas like oh okay problems are relative I read it for that reason to it's sort of like when I used to box and I used to get my ass kicked in the morning I was like oh everything else the volume's way turned down like I just got beat up and it's okay like I don't mind like and that's sort of why I like reading biographies I also like reading them because I like seeing this is a normal feeling that I am having it is it is okay and that is like a cool thing about about these people is when I'm in these moments I think don't burn it down don't walk away don't don't do these things it is normal to have this and you have to accept that like in order to do anything interesting conflict is part of that and oftentimes conflict or constraints is where Beauty and art is created do you know what I mean yes um 100% that that makes a lot of sense to me and I think is pretty wise to be honest let me ask you a question have you ever heard the phrase somebody say the slang skill issue you're not a gamer and you're not like 17 years old so you might not be like part of this like subculture where one of the like common Internet slangs is just skill issue and what skill issue me like somebody will describe like a huge problem they'll be on Reddit typing like this whole thing about how this is bad and this is hard and this this thing out of my control whatever and then somebody will just skill issue and I think it started with gaming which is like they're complaining about the game game and then somebody who's better at the game will just say skill issue and what it fundamentally means is like there are so many things that we describe as outside of our control or just fundamentally hard or impossible that's actually a skill issue meaning if you had the skill you wouldn't be bitching and whining about this um that's how I felt about yesterday meaning when I started reading the Gman stuff I realized oh skill issue disagreeing and arguing is a skill and I have a skill issue I am not as good at it as I could be and the reason why is um when I'm reading his stuff he's got all these different words to describe things he's like I was reading his like encoding of the arguments it's like cross complaint I'm cross what's a cross complaint I'm like looking it up I'm like oh yeah yeah he just did that he he did a cross complaint like that's what that was that's why that didn't feel good and he's like yes but and I was like oh dude yeah I did a yes but where I agreed but then I like under my agreement right afterwards by the next sentence I said um and I realized in the same way that uh I once read like intelligence is the number of distinctions you have on a subject what that means is if if you talk to Eskimos about snow snow we like I have one word for snow snow they have like 15 18 21 different ways to describe snow the snow that's a little bit runny the snow that's really hard the snow that falls fast the snow that like behaves differently because they live in the snow they had they had to become intelligent about snow they had to create a vocabulary that described the distinctions because they mattered in their life and they were familiar with them whereas somebody who's not not so skilled and familiar with snow only has one word in the same way as this guy was describing argument Dynamics I realized oh skill issue there are a bunch of words for snow that I don't know when it comes to arguing and arguing well I think it's even got a book called like fight right or some [ __ ] I haven't read it yet but it's like I'm going to go read and so that was the last interesting takeaway which is yet again skill issue uh so many things in my life just come down to that oh losing weight is hard no no no skill issue I used to have this [ __ ] friend in college who used to say uh the only way you get good at drinking and driving is through a lot of practice I'm like you're a horrible h HB but you might be right uh and uh that's sort of that's kind of like this that's kind of like this you got to fight a lot in order to like uh uh learn how to do it correctly um okay well Sam I'm sorry for all of those reasons that I just said and and it's mutual you prepared this so it's gonna sound like you're well you are uh it sounds like you're being the bigger the bigger man and I want to let and and I want to let you know that uh everything is mutual uh I feel that like uh it sounds like you well it sounds like you're in some ways you you're you're sort of acting that you didn't blame me for anything you only blamed yourself and I and I want to let you know that that's not actually the reality you just you just used more words than I did your word count was higher but that doesn't mean that the the feeling is different okay perfectly perfect to say it that's it that's the PO by the way we get to use the one time and one time only YouTuber thing to do where it's like it's all over I'm shutting it down we we quit uh we're breaking up like the one time you can fake you could fake your own death you could fake retirement you could fake your breakup and everybody wants to click to see the Goss and then they you know it's the boy who cried wolf you can only do it once but you get a hell a lot of clicks that time so I think we should use it this time we should title this whatever you know the is this podcast or yeah it's over sorry guys you know you know Sean's apology or like uh we're breaking up here's why some some version of that [Music]

Lea and I had so we started dating in April of 16 I immediately was like I've got this idea for this thing called gym launch I want to go fly out to gyms and do turnarounds because I can like fill my gyms up faster than I can build them by the way context is at the time you owned a couple of gyms I had five I had five gyms when I met her and the bank balance looked like what at the time I was making like 20 grand a month I know that so I like I don't remember what my savings were but I was making like 20 grand a month in cash flow and you're like wait five gyms it's like yeah some of them were good some of them were I two corporate locations were a little smaller anyways but I was like 25 26 so like I was Hood Rich you know as far as I'm concerned I could buy whatever I wanted I could live where I wanted you know I could go out to eat whatever and so I started the turnaround business and um I made $100,000 in cash in 21 days and I was like holy [ __ ] I was like this is awesome and so I came back and she picked me from the airport and I had this big stack of contracts and I was like hey we can go on that date because I hadn't taken on a date in three weeks and we'd seen each other every day so it' been like 21 days of hanging out and not one date and so she like you promised youd take me on a date after we after you did this launch and I was like okay okay I was like help me process these so you processed the contracts in 45 minutes she saw it was 100 Grand she was like holy [ __ ] the first question she asked is is this legal and I was like yeah it's legal and she was like all right I'm in and so she decided to join me so we went out to the next launch together a few more launches and then one of the launch guys that I did that I did really well the one that I came back with 100 grand for was like hey let's partner like instead of you know you just doing these gyms and walking away let's just open new gyms I'm a really good operator I'll just open them behind you and run it and then if you open up one or two gyms a month at the end year you own 24 gyms instead of just like doing the service and me being me I was like of course money on the table why would I not do that and the fact that he had been indicted for fraud like it was a misunderstanding whatever and he was like Hey you know you should sign all the leases for these new locations because I had a little runin like no big deal you should do it and so I personally guarantee the lease and I put all the capital up because you know I'm 25 and don't know what I'm doing um and so of course we know how this story goes I launched that launch did 376 you know new members which for like a crossfit micro JY is massive to to open up with then I wake up one morning and all the cash in the bank account's gone and I was like what the [ __ ] and I you know hit him up and I was like dude what's going on he's like oh that was my half and I was like what do you mean your half I was like you just took all the money out he's like well I know you've been skimming and I was like what I was like I'm here what I'm here every what so I I came to him with all the bank accounts like every transaction highlighted and I was like hey let's go through this like I just want to make sure we're good and he R off the table he's like I don't need to see that [ __ ] and I was like oh you okay got I Now understand what happened like okay so I just got all my money stolen and right at when that had happened I had decided to go all in on that business so I sold my gyms and I put all that cash in that account so the cash that I used to open the gym and the subsequent cash that came all of that was pulled into one place but that was what I had sold all my gyms for and so when he emptied that I had basically the five years I had building my gyms I had nothing and so that sucked uh and so Lea was like you know dust it off forget the whole like build and whatever like let's just go back to the turnaround model like you made money doing that like let's do that I was like all right we'll do that and so the next launch that's supposed to happen is in California there's a guy who hits me up randomly on Instagram says hey do you have work for me I've got two I've got a kid on the way and I got a one-year-old I need the money and it just so happened he lived 10 minutes away from the one gym that we were going to launch in the world and so I was like dude do this launch for me so he does a hundred he does 100 Grand in sales in 28 days and all of a sudden though as I'm like normally I know my deposits always hit on Tuesdays over the weekends and so Tuesday hits and I'm like there's no deposit I'm like we're processing the contracts like what's going on I call up Mind Body which was the you know Harland was the processor they integrated with at the time and they put they gave me the runaround and they're like oh it's a standard annual review and I was like okay and no no Wednesday no Thursday Friday no Saturday then it's the weekend again and then Tuesday comes back and no no deposit and I was like dude what the [ __ ] so they said no you're still in the annual review so I did it one more week and now it's Christmas Eve and I had about 23 grand left after all the money was it was basically my checking was what was left from all that other stuff and so they got on the phone I said I'm not getting off it's Christmas Eve I need to pay my guys like what the hell and they said we're going to hold on to this for six months because it's a regular activity because I was processing these ter around gyms through my brick and mortar location I didn't know how processing work so I was like you know I'm flying into Calgary Canada doing a turnaround running it through Huntington Beach California for an in-person transaction like I didn't know how it worked and so they were like this is weird we're going to hold on to the funds and so I owed $22,000 in commissions for sales that I hadn't gotten paid for for this guy who had you know the kids and the babies or whatever and so I didn't want to like give myself the idea that I could not pay him and so I sent him the money and so I had $1,000 left it's Christmas we're at lless family's house I'm stressed the [ __ ] out because I just lost all my money in the last two like I got the money stolen and then the my my Hillary to save the day was the 100 grand new launch I didn't get paid for that I ended up just having to empty the the small 20 grand that I had and had $1,000 left she told six of her friends to quit their jobs to start that month on the 26th of December because that's going into new year so I could I was like let's do six gyms because that's logical go from one to six immediately um since we're going to go all in and so after I found out that I didn't have any money and I had $1,000 left and the ads were supposed to launch on the 26th and uh I was going to be spending 3,300 a day in advertising hotels rental car per DMS for the six sales guys that were her friends and I had $1,000 in total and so I you know we're sitting at like like her parents are downstairs we're in like the the spare bedroom where like the grandkids are so there's like this little mini Furniture everywhere they like I'm sitting in a tiny chair and I was like hey um this could go horribly wrong and if you I said I I wouldn't stay with me if I were you um I am a sinking ship right now and so in that moment she grabbed my chin and she was like I would sleep with you in for bridge if he came to that and so I was like all right and honestly I just kind of felt relief at the time I kind of I can appreciate it more later but you know she quit her job to join me doing these turnarounds and all she got to see besides the one that she did in the beginning was me just getting kicked in the nuts for like eight straight months and so then the next day I said okay well I still a $100,000 limit on my credit card from all my five gyms like AMX had an updated the fact that I was broke and so I put 3,300 a day on the credit card mind you with no way to process money and so I'm spending 33 3,300 a day of money I don't have with no way to process new money and so I I got like porn casino and like gambling processing that had like 10% reserves and like 6% 7% processing fees they were taking like 177% off the top um but I needed the cash and so um I got one turned on with a 50k limit and I needed I mean I had 100K in cost I need it was we were going to do 200 200 I needed 200 Grand and it was like well if you do well uh you know you get 50 and I got it only turned on three days before the end of January so this whole time I'm Froning 3,300 a day and we're collecting these contracts with credit cards and I'm not processing anything and people were calling me like hey I haven't seen the money come out hey like what's going on are you guys going to run the run the card we're like yeah yeah we're getting to it and uh and so 3 days before the end of January the first uh 50k uh processor hits and so I run that in the day you know because I had so much so much backlog but he's like the good news is it's per month so on the 1 of February you can run another 50 so I ran 5050 and that covered my 100 that went out the 3,300 a day and then I got two more processors turned on at 5050 and then and then I was able to to get out of it there's also another crash that happens after that where I lost it all again three months later um but that was because all of the launches that we were doing I had a new hole in my model which is that I was selling and other people were delivering and then they would tell the customers to refund and then sign up with them for half the price after we'd leave so we'd sell like five you know we'd sell a $500 challenge or whatever and then we'd put a 100 people in the location and they would just tell them all like hey refund with them sign up with me for 200 bucks and uh we'd already I already fronted the cost for the hotel the I spend the commission is the sales guy like all that jazz and and so that's when I lost everything again and that was that was probably the hardest of all of them all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

fundamentally you know you think about like are there Supply constraint businesses or demand constraint businesses and I like going into demand constraint businesses because that's what I'm good at so the core if there was one framework in the book that it relates to it's the value equation which is that you have to understand how to create value so that you can charge as much as possible right and obviously also convert as many people as humanly possible and so there's four elements that one is the dream outcome the second is the perceived likely of achievement and then below that so it's a fraction so dream outcome times perceive elective achievement below that you have time delay and then effort and sacrifice and so the dream outcome is what I would say separates whether someone's even interested in your category of offer or not so it's you know men in general probably want to make more money women in general in general usually want to look better because both of those are more associated with status so okay why is it that B2B offers tend to be more expensive than b2c offers because it's more closely tied to Roi great so that's the category one but within let's say weight loss given the example we're talking about if you're B Toc how is it that you can have a $5 PDF and a $50,000 lipos suction thing but they both fundamentally solve the same problem which is that they don't like the way their stomach looks right what's the other three variables and so the next is perceived likelihood of achievement so taking the liposuction example if you're a surgeon or you're a girl and you're you're thinking about getting liposuction uh and there's one surgeon that's uh just fresh out of medical school hasn't done a surgery yet and there's another physician who's got 10,000 you know five stars or surgeries under his belt who do you go to the guy with 10,000 why and and the crazy thing is is that it's the same procedure but the perceived likel of achievement that you're going to get what you want is significantly higher and so you pay for that premium the equal opposite of this is risk right and so how do we decrease risk so you have this dream outcome and you want it to be absolutely certain that you're going to achieve it and so it's the category and then there's things you do in the offer like that's where guarantees come into play is how can I further decrease the risk associated with that and then we have the bottom side of the equation which is time delay so how how far between when they buy and when they get and so to use the example of personal training versus the liposuction personal training you got to arm wrestle somebody for an hour to get them to buy a $2,000 package of of uh personal training and the reason for that is because they might get their six-pack you know 12 to 18 months later whereas if you do lipo section you know you're going to go to sleep and then you're going to wake up and you're going to be significantly thinner so the time delay is so much shorter and so because of that it increases the value overall and then finally you have uh effort and sacrifice which effort are that you have to begin doing that you don't want to do as a result of a purchase so in the personal training example you got to wake up early you got to be sore that's the effort side you have to stop you know well sacrifices the things you have to stop doing that you want to keep doing so it's like you got to stop Taco Tuesday you got to stop sleeping in because you got to do in the morning so it's both sides of the same coin effort and sacrifice and when you itemize all the things that a customer has to do as a result of a purchase what are all the things that they what are the things that increase their risk what are the things that make it take longer what are the things that make them start doing things they hate and what are the things that we have them stop doing that they love and then you create solutions for each of those categories then you create an incredibly valuable offer and so from the weight loss perspective many people think oh I'm G to help them lose weight but it's like well they're going to have to go grocery shopping differently they're going to have to learn how to prep food and so it's really getting granular about all the little steps that has to occur in order for someone to get a result and so looking at what happens immediately before and immediately post purchase uh all the little steps and then trying to deconstruct offer and this is where you get these massive stepwise increases in terms of company value because all of a sudden we can double the price or triple the price for offer and close at a higher percentage and so that's when these crazy kind of like lava paloa effects occur in the business where they go from 2 million to 10 in a year changing nothing but what the core offer of what they said was and then we do these little enhancers that I'll add on which is like you've got scarcity which is limiting number of units you've got urgency which is limit number of time you have um guarantees which is things that we do to reverse risk they there's four types of guarantees you can do unconditional conditional zero guarantee and then performance right so performance what I call an implied guarantee like if you know if you don't make money out don't make money anti- guarantees you lean into the fact that you don't have a guarantee if you're this type of person needs a guarantee this isn't for you conditional like I'll guarantee it if you do x y z and then unconditional it's unconditional like I'll I'll give your money back if you ask for it then you have uh bonuses which are things that drive action in the short term um buying decisions and so a lot of those things that you can make an irresistible offer or a grand slam offer from the book is by looking at each of those problems and creating kind of a bonus stack that solves each of them and so from a selling perspective hand toand the salesman doesn't need to say all seven of the things that you have and so the idea is that you make the ask on the initial offer if they say no you figure out the constraint is and then you plug that bonus in and then maybe you need to put three bonuses in in order to get them over the edge this also allows the sales team to stop doing discounts in order to close people we just add value rather than taking away price and then postp purchase in order to make sure that Ops is all the same you then give them a surprise and delay with the remaining four you say by the way since you did buy I want to give you these other things and so if you get the fast buyer that doesn't need the bonuses you just give them the bonuses and they love you and if you got to somebody who needs all seven then you give them the seven bonuses uh on the sales calls and that's kind of how you can just get increased close rates without giving away discounts God damn yeah High highly useful I feel pumped up brother I need to go read I need to go read the blue and the purple one all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

I made $100,000 in cash in 21 days the first question she asked is is this legal that I wake up on the morning and all the cash in the bank account's gone and I was like what the [ __ ] I just got all my money stolen and I was like I wouldn't stay with me if I were you I am a sinking ship right now so from that brink of failure to what was it at the end of a year so I spent 48 Hours Took a ton of adall and wrote the best sales out of my life and then the full next calendar year we did uh 26 million and uh 16 million in evida dude that's insane so why do a SAS deal or why do the school deal in my opinion it was the best deal I've ever done how much cash did you put up up front like almost what's a company you would want to go buy right [Music] now Sam I don't know if you've heard this about the story with your wife Lea and yeah being on the brink of failure yeah waiting in the swamp of failure yeah could you take us back there what what was going on yeah so Leela and I had so we started dating in April of 16 I immediately was like I've got this idea for this thing called gym launch I want to go fly out to gyms and do turnarounds because I can like fill my gyms up faster than I can build them by the way context is at the time you owned a couple of gyms yeah I had five I had five gyms when I met her and the bank balance looked like what at the time I was making like 20 grand a month I know that so I like I don't remember what my savings were but I was making like 20 grand a month in cash flow and you're like wait five gyms it's like yeah some of them weren't good some of them were I two corporate locations that were a little smaller anyways but I was like 25 26 so like I was Hood Rich you know as far as I'm concerned I could buy whatever I wanted I could live where I wanted you know I could go out to eat whatever and so I started the turnaround business and um I made $100,000 in cash in 21 days and I was like holy [ __ ] I was like this is awesome and so I came back and she picked me from the airport and I had this big stack of contracts and I was like hey we can go that date cuz I hadn't taken on a date in three weeks and we'd seen each other every day so it' been like 21 days of hanging out and not one date and so she said you promised you'd take me on a date after we after you did this launch and I was like okay okay I was like help me process these so you processed the contracts in 45 minutes she saw it was 100 Grand she was like holy [ __ ] the first question she asked is is this legal and I was like yeah it's legal and she was like all right I'm in and so she decided to join me so we went out to the next launch together a few more launches and then one of the launch guys that I did that I did really well the one that I came back with 100 grand for was hey let's partner like instead of you know you just doing these gyms and then walking away let's just open new gyms I'm a really good operator I'll just open them behind you and run it and then if you open up one or two gyms a month at the end of the year you own 24 gyms instead of just like doing the service and me being me I was like of course money on the table why would I not do that and the fact that he had been indicted for fraud like it was a misunderstanding whatever and he was like Hey you know you should sign all the leases for these new locations because I had a little run in like no big deal you should do it and so I personally guantee the lease and I put all the capital up because you know I'm 25 and don't know what I'm doing um and so of course we know how this story goes I launched it I crushed launched 376 you know new members which for like a crossfit micr JY is massive to to open up with then I wake up one morning and all the cash and the bank account's gone and I was like what the [ __ ] and I you know hit him up and I was like dude what's going on he's like oh that was my half and I was like what do you mean your half I was like you just to all the money up he's like well I know you've been skimming and I was like what I was like I'm here what I'm here what so I I came to him with all the bank accounts like every transaction highlighted and I was like hey let's go through this like I just want to make sure we're good and he threw it off the table he's like I don't need to see that [ __ ] and I was like oh you okay got I Now understand what happened like okay so I just got all my money stolen and right at when that had happened I had decided to go all in on that business so I sold my gyms and I put all that cash in that account so the cash that I used to open the gym and the subsequent cash that came all of that was pulled into one place but that was what I had sold all my gyms for and so when he emptied that I had basically the five years I had building my gyms I had nothing and so that sucked uh and so Lea was like you know dust it off forget the whole like build and whatever like let's just go back to the turnaround model like you made money doing that like let's do that I was like all right we'll do that and so the next launch that's supposed to happen is in California there's a guy who hits me up randomly on Instagram says hey do you have work for me I've got two I've got a kid on the way and I got a one-year-old I need the money and it just so happened he lived 10 minutes away from the one gym that we were going to launch in the world and so I was like dude do this launch for me so he does a hundred he does a 100 Grand in sales in 28 days and all of a sudden though as I'm like normally I know my deposits always hit on Tuesdays over the weekends and so Tuesday hits and I'm like there's no deposit I'm like we're processing the contracts like what's going on I call up Mind Body which is the you know was the processor they integrated with at the time and they put they give me the runaround and they're like oh it's a standard annual review and I was like okay and no no Wednesday no Thursday no Friday no Saturday then it's the weekend again and then Tuesday comes back and no no deposit and I was like dude what the [ __ ] so they said no you're still in the annual review so I did it one more week and now it's Christmas Eve and I had about 23 grand left after all the money was it was basically my checking was what was left from all that other stuff and so they got on the phone I said I'm not getting off it's Christmas Eve I need to pay my guys like what the hell and they said we're going to hold on to this for six months because it's a regular activity because I was processing these turnaround gyms through my brick and mortar location I didn't know how processing work I was like you know I'm flying into Calgary Canada doing a turnaround running it through Huntington Beach California for an in-person transaction like I didn't know how it worked and so they were like this is weird we're going to hold on to the funds and so I owed $22,000 in commissions for sales that I hadn't gotten paid for for this guy who had you know the kids and the babies or whatever and so I didn't want to like give myself the idea that I could not pay him and so I sent him the money and so I had $1,000 left it's Christmas we're at lelis family's house I'm stressed the [ __ ] out because I just lost all my money in the last two like I got the money stolen and then the my my Hill Mary to save the day was the 100 grand new launch I didn't get paid for that I ended up just having to empty the the small 20 grand that I had and had $1,000 left she told six of her friends to quit their jobs to start that month on the 26th of December because that's going into new year so I could do I was like let's do six gyms because that's logic go go from 1 to six immediately um since we're going to go all in and so after I found out that I didn't have any money and I had ,000 left and the ads were supposed to launch on the 26th and uh I was going to be spending 3,300 a day in advertising hotels rental car per DMS for the six sales guys that were her friends and and I had $1,000 in total and so I you know we're sitting at like like her parents are downstairs we're in like the the spare bedroom where like the grandkids are so there's like this little mini Furniture everywhere they like I'm sitting in a tiny chair and I was like hey um this could go horribly wrong and if you I said I I wouldn't stay with me if I were you um I am a sinking ship right now and so in that moment she grabbed my chin and she was like I would sleep with you under a bridge if you came to that and so I was like all right and honestly I just kind of felt relief at the time I kind of I can appreciate it more later but you know she quit her job to join me doing these turnarounds and all she got to see besides the one that she did in the beginning was me just getting kicked in the nuts for like eight straight months and so then the next day I said okay well I still have a $100,000 limit on my credit card from all my five gyms like AMX hadn't updated the fact that I was broke and so I put 3,300 a day on that credit card mind you with no way to process money and so I'm spending 33 3,300 a day of money I don't have with no way to process new money and so I I got like porn casino and like gambling processing that had like 10 % reserves and like 6% 7% processing fees they were taking like 177% off the top um but I needed the cash and so um I got one turned on with a 50k limit and I needed I mean I had 100K in cost I need it was we were going to do 200 200 I needed 200 Grand and it was like well if you do well uh you know you get 50 and I got it only turned on 3 days before the end of January so this whole time I'm Froning 3,300 a day and we're collecting these contracts with credit cards and I'm not processing anything and people are calling me like hey I haven't seen the money come out hey like what's going on are you guys going to run the run the card we're like yeah yeah we're getting to it and uh and so three days before the end of January the first uh 50k uh processor hits and so I run that in a day you know because I had so much so much backlog but he's like the good news is it's per month so on the 1 of February you can run another 50 so I ran 5050 and that covered my 100 that went out the 3,300 a day and then I got two more processors turned on at 5050 and then and then I was able to to get out of it there's also another crash that happens after that where I lost it all again three months later um but that was because all of the launches that we were doing I had a new hole in my model which is that I was selling and other people were delivering and then they would tell the customers to refund and then sign up with them for half the price after we'd leave so we'd sell like five you know we'd sell a $500 challenge or whatever and then we'd put a 100 people in the location and they would just tell them all like hey refund with them sign up with me for 200 bucks and uh we'd already I already fronted the cost for the hotel the IID spend the commission as the sales guy like all that jazz and so that's when I lost everything again and that was that was probably the hardest of all of them because this was the only model I knew and so the more I sold the more refund risk I exposed myself to and so it was just like I had to sell more to cover the first month refunds and then the next month was bigger and then I had to sell more more to cover that month's refund and so then I had had to make a switch in 30 days to come with 150 Grand in profit in profit in 30 days and I was like I don't know what I'm going to do so the first two were out of your control you know business partner screws you the payment process turns you off this one your model was broken yeah where you're like oh [ __ ] because Sam I don't know if you know how this business worked it was basically like he would go my understanding is you'd go turn around the gym which means just you'd sell a bunch of memberships and the deal was like I keep The Upfront cash and then you keep the members and so they were just like he took all the up front he made 100 Grand in like whatever a month or something a few of them were like well you know what why don't I just cut the cut them out and just do the deal directly with my customers who I'm going to serve going forward and so that one was your fault in in your control basically your model but then you fixed the model right and it it worked well sort of so what ended up happening is I told Lila I was like Hey cuz she still had her Fitness clients because she was a personal trainer and she had a book of business here she converted like half of them into like online training before online training was a thing and so she was making like four grand a month and one day we're sitting at the kitchen table and I was like hey how much you make on that and she was like defensive she's like hey this pays for our food and I was like no no no I'm not like I'm not saying it's a bad thing and um she's like I don't know like four grand a month why I was like how many hours a week do it take you and she's like I don't know four hours I was like that's not a bad business I was like well I already know how to sell Fitness why don't let's cut the gym owner out like let's just sell straight to Consumer and so I spent 48 Hours Took a ton of adall and wrote the best sales letter in my life got ads live in 48 hours to a sales letter and we started doing 500 bucks a day 500 to a th000 a day this is like a a women's weight loss product now it was called Queen transformation and so it it told L sign me up yeah let's go lost she lost 100 pounds and then did a fitness competitor so she had a great before and after great transformation story I wrot as though I yeah Lila as though I were her so I'm like my thighs were chafing together and I couldn't go out of the side like it was it was just me right my thighs are shaving yeah so this is working a th I get that now I need a sign up for this clean transformation all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show so we did the thousand bucks today and I I got eight sales guys now and I was like wait if I got eight guys I I can do eight grand a day with with covering cost I could make 150 on this like this could work and so I call up the gyms that are supposed to launch the next month and I said hey we're not flying out and they were like what the hell and then one guy's like dude I need this you turned around one of my buddy's gyms and like because for the other model not work only like one out of five gyms had to [ __ ] me so it wasn't like they all did it like some of them were fine but like my profit was like 20% you know what I mean and so I called the first guy up and he's like I need this and so I I said he said he was poor so just said the highest number I could think of at the time which was $6,000 I was like fine I'm not flying out there to save your ass if you can't close but I'll show you how I did it uh for six grand and he was like six grand he was like done and I remember just like looking at the phone being like whole I mean I was selling $500 $300 $400 at a time like six grand I was like what the [ __ ] just happened and so I still had seven more calls that day so I called the next guy same conversation he's like how much I was like eight grand he was like done and so next call same thing how much 10 grand and by the end of the day I did 60,00 in cash collected and I was like holy [ __ ] now your now your thighs are really shaing yeah and so I call so Lea comes in after full day of sales and I was like I think we're still in the gym business and she was like what you just sold me on like this is the new direction we're going to be online Queen transformation and I was like no I think I think we were just doing it wrong I like I think we just need to show them how we fill gyms rather than flying out and filling it for them let them take the risk on the ad spend and the like they don't have to do a hotel they don't have to hire a Salesman like they can just do it themselves if you you know if I teach them how to do it and so we did that and then I called the 30 plus gyms we turned around and I was like hey remember that thing I did want me to show you how I did it and a lot of them saw me pull 100 grand out and one out of five was like I'm gonna super [ __ ] this guy but four out of five were probably like this guy made more out of my gym than I did like and so when I called him back almost all of them said yes and so I did like 240 Grand in sales in that next 30 days that was almost all profit and I was able to pay off all the refunds that were going to be due from all the other so I paid the 150 down and I was like in the clear and then that was what became that's what became gym launch dude that's insane have you ever felt richer than that first relief of being like out of the mess no I say it in my book in the offers book the last the last chapter is uh the first 100,000 when we had our first 100,000 which was like four or six weeks after that I showed it to Lelo on the phone and I was like we did it and she was like what do you mean and I was like look and I like pulled it up but it wasn't like in the business account cuz I'd had that in like business you but it was like but that's like operating expensive and earmark for other stuff but like this was like in the personal account and I was like we can we can screw up for like three years and we're going to be fine like we could do we could just do we could take off for three years and be fine and uh to this day it is it is a 100% the richest I've ever felt and I think it's because of relative change in wealth because I have thought about it because it's like if you go from $1,000 to $100,000 it's a it's a 100x increase in wealth in a month by the way the the end of that story is like a within the first 12 months there's some like ridiculous Benchmark that you guys hit right so from that brink of failure to what was it at the end of a year yeah so so we did the so December 26 the of of 2016 uh processor shuts me down and I make the big bet and Laya says I'll go with you under a bridge and 3 3,300 a day it takes four or five months for me to realize the new model where I fly out to gyms has this big refund problem and so now we're into May of 17 uh I flip I flipped during that kind of like April May is the model uh and we started doing the the licensing model and it goes like 400 700 uh a million one two5 like into the end of the year so we ended up with like 6.8 million Topline and I think we did 3 million in profit and then the full next calendar year we did uh 26 million and uh 16 million in iida that's insane yeah it was wild it was just as wild for me for anyone who's listening like I actually think it took me like three years to acclimate to the wealth that we were making it was like it was probably like 2019 is like end of 2019 2020 is when I started to like realize how much money that we were making because I didn't adjust my I didn't adjust my living like we did buy a house it's like three years later one day you just woke up and you were like holy [ __ ] feel good wait a minute what is this yeah well it's like cuz we we took out 42 million in distributions prior to selling it and so that's why the sale was not like a I mean we got a ton of notoriety from the sale but in terms of material change in living like it wasn't a massive step up Sam have you actually read his offers book the purple one I read the purple one hey no i' read I yeah I read it no it was leads I thought the purple one and then say bro I read sorry leads well they're all like the same cover just uh but they're like the same thing no I read the oh well they're like the same color liting makes it look like they're more simar than they are I read the lead one all right so uh the compliment is Alex you have a very useful thing on offers that I read a bit of the books I read like the first 20% of the book I was like sweet got it ready to act don't need the rest of this book right now knew exactly what I needed to do and it really wasn't actually something super specific in the book it was just implanting the idea you sparked an idea of my head of how do you make somebody an offer so good that would be stupid to turn you down and that stuck with me it was like that one line stuck with me and then immediately I went into this one business that we had started and we had this business that I was like what this business needs is a killer offer and we're going to do nothing until we craft a killer offer and we've crafted a killer offer in that first year of this this business we we haven't announced on the podcast it'll probably do four million in in Revenue 50% margins it's a really great business and it needed a killer offer and I would not have had that idea had I not heard you kind of plant that seed of like why that matters can you give us the like couple minute version for anybody else that's listening because if it was that useful for me I know it's going to be useful for a few hundred thousand other people that are going to listen to this also I'll say because of what you said I wrote a summary and workbook of offers so that they can finish it in one sitting does it come with crayons my kind of guy yeah exactly yeah crowns are up um so fundamentally you know you think about like are there Supply Dem are there Supply businesses or demand constrain businesses and I like going into demand constrain businesses because that's what I'm good at so the core if there was one framework in the book that it relates to it's the value equation which is that you have to understand how to create value so that you can charge as much as possible right and obviously also convert as many people as humanly possible and so there's four elements that one is the dream outcome the second is the perceived likely of achievement and then below that so it's a fraction so dream outcome times perceive like of achievement below that you have time delay and then effort and sacrifice and so the dream outcome is what I would say separates whether someone's even interested in your category of offer or not so it's you know men in general probably want to make more money women in general in general usually want to look better because both of those are more associated with status so okay why is it that B2B offers tend to be more expensive than b2c offers because it's more closely tied to Roi great so that's the category one but within let's say weight loss given the example we're talking about if you're B Toc how is it that you can have a $5 PDF and a $50,000 lipo suction thing but they both fundamentally solve the the same problem which is that they don't like the way their stomach looks right what's the other three variables and so the next is perceived likelihood of achievement so taking the lipos suction example if you're a surgeon or you're a girl and you're you're thinking about getting lipos suction uh and there's one surgeon that's uh just fresh out of medical school hasn't done a surgery yet and there's another physician who's got 10,000 you know five stars or surgeries under his belt who do you go to the guy with 10,000 why and and the crazy thing is is that it's the same procedure but the perceived likely of achievement that you're going to get what you want is significantly higher and so you pay for that premium because it the equal opposite of this is risk right and so how do we decrease risk so you have this dream outcome and you want it to be absolutely certain that you're going to achieve it and so it's the category and then there's things you do in the offer like that's where guarantees come into play is how can I further decrease the risk associated with that and then we have the bottom side of the equation which is time delay so how how far between when they buy and when they get and so to use the the example of person training versus the lipo suction personal training you got to arm wrestle somebody for an hour to get them to buy a $2,000 package of of uh personal training and the reason for that is because they might get their six-pack you know 12 to 18 months later whereas if you do lipo section you know you're going to go to sleep and then you're going to wake up and you're going to be significantly thinner so the time delay is so much shorter and so because of that it increases the value overall and then finally you have uh effort and sacrifice which effort are things that you have to begin doing that you don't want to do as a result of a purchase so in the personal training example you got to wake up early you got to be sore that's the effort side you have to stop you know well sacrifices the things you have to stop doing that you want to keep doing so it's like you got to stop Taco Tuesday you got to stop sleeping in because you got to do in the morning so it's both sides of the same coin effort and sacrifice and when you itemize all the things that a customer has to do as a result of a purchase what are all the things that they what are the things that increase their risk what are the things that make it take longer what are the things that make them start doing things they hate and what are the things that we have them stop doing that they love and then you create solutions for each of those categories then you create an incredibly valuable offer and so from the weight loss perspective many people think oh I'm going to help them lose weight but it's like well they're going to have to go grocery shopping differently they're going to have to learn how to prep food and so it's really getting granular about all the little steps that has to occur in order for someone to get a result and so looking at what happens immediately before and immediately post purchase uh all the little steps and then trying to deconstruct offer and this is where you get these massive stepwise increases in terms of company value because all of a sudden we can double the price or triple the price for offer and close at a higher percentage and so that's when these crazy kind of like La paloa effects occur in the business where they go from 2 million to 10 in a year changing nothing but what the the core offer of what they said was and then we do these little enhancers that I'll add on which is like you've got scarcity which is limiting number of units you've got urgency which is limit number of time you have um guarantees which is things that we do to reverse risk they there's four types of guarantees you can do unconditional conditional zero guarantee and then performance right so performance what I call an implied guarantee like if you know if you don't make money I don't make money anti- guarantees you lean into the fact that you don't have a guarantee if you're the type of person who needs a guarantee this isn't for you conditionals like I'll guarantee it if you X Y and Z and then unconditional it's unconditional like I'll I'll give your money back if you ask for it then you have uh bonuses which are things that drive action in the short-term um buying decisions and so a lot of those things that you can make an irresistible offer or a grand slam offer from the book is by looking at each of those problems and creating kind of a bonus stack that solves each of them and so from a selling perspective hand toand the salesman doesn't need to say all seven of the things that you have and so the idea is that you make the ask on the initial offer if they say no you figure out what the constraint is and then you plug that bonus in and then maybe you need to put three bonuses in in order to get them over the edge this also allows the sales team to stop doing discounts in order to close people we just add value rather than taking away price and then post purchase in order to make sure that Ops is all the same you then give them a surprise and delay with the remaining four you say by the way since you did buy I want to give you these other things and so if you get the fast buyer that doesn't need the bonuses you just give them the bonuses and they love you and if you got to somebody who needs all seven then you give them the seven bonuses on the sales calls that's kind of how you can just get increased close rates without giving away discounts God damn yeah High highly useful I feel pumped up brother I need to go read I need to go read the blue and the purple one like this is the stuff that I enjoy um and that's the stuff that we do to like really grow the business in the portfolio is we're we're in it we're rescripting the sales like we're we're changing the process overall like we bought a chain of 32 Teeth whing Studios is there anyone at acquisition. comom who's better than you at this or are you still the best when it comes to like offer reimagining like mixed with sales process that's probably my strongest it's probably the thing I'm best at and it just drives so much profit in a business since pricing is the strongest lever own profit there's a great example of the offer by the way uh I've been kneed Deep In Like A I do these twoe learning Sprints where I just pick whatever the topic I'm most interested in I just go [ __ ] Ham on it like every minute that I'm not on this podcast or not on like a required meeting I'm just like going down on one Topic in this case it doing like the old school marketers and um there's a great story I think it's oie who when he launched his agency he's like how do I get people to do this and he basically made a killer offer he was like uh take your top performing ad that you've spent years iterating on and you got this to be your top performing ad I guarantee that I will beat it in an AB test head-to-head within a month and I will fund my portion of the ab test so I'll make the ad I guarantee you that I'll beat it and I'll fund the ad cost of the I'm so confident I will fund the ad cost uh if I don't beat it or even I think even not if I don't beat it I will fund the ad cost in order to win your business and what he said was this was like the response rate on this ad was through the roof because he's like but the best part was of the 100% of people that responded he's like we didn't even end up having to do it because the top 20% the most expensive clients were like okay cool forget the ab test and the mechanics and the contract for that like the fact that you're willing to do that we looked into your track record we are big believers this we'd like to just move forward and and go ahead and ENT retain you I we know that our agency would never be that confident to pull that up so we're willing to to work with you and he's like it was incredible because I was a I used this killer offer to fill up the funnel and then I just picked the top 20% of clients in that funnel and that kickstarted ogal which became you know one of the big ad agencies that's in the game and like we bought that um the teeth whing chain and so I sat down with our director of sales and we rescripted the sales process and basically reimagined how the offers were going to happen and uh we 5x LTV per sale and so I was like okay um here's the plan just roll it out fundamentally it's like a lot of times people think there's a lot more that it takes to grow the company but sometimes just a handful of levers just make a huge difference does every business and product offering have a killer offer inside of them I do think so I think that sometimes you have like the big part with the offer is you have to operationalize it and so if you're OG it's like okay well how can I write all these split T like it's like how if I'm going to have all these bonuses that I have to add in in order to make the thing more valuable I have to operationalize that part and so yes I do think so it's just like usually you might sometimes have to put like terms around that like if I was an accounting firm something boring it's like I can guarantee that I will get you more than you pay me by just auditing your back taxes and saving that money today right uh but you have to provide all the back taxes and like you have to and then I have to have a separate team that I now have to create just for our front end conversion to shrink time to Value using that little nugget and the big thing with most of the businesses I try and Shrink time to Value like really aggressively like even that publishing business it takes a very long time for that business for a customer to get a result um and so we looked at it we're like can we peel some element of what we do and drop it into the beginning and it turns out we could do something in like seven days that gave people a very positive outcome really quickly and then they like get bought in emotionally that you know what you're doing and to further on the point I think that probably a major difference between like the tiny Wilkinson model and how we do it is that we are operators and so the investment strategy has slowly you know continues to you know move over time but it's been fewer bigger deals that we have larger percentages of that we do more for and it's just like basically the more we work on the business the more money we make and so if we're going to work on it then it might as well be back dude you you did that school deal right uh we had we had s on the Pod interesting guy Sam ens we're talking about school.com is it school.com he um one of the oddest people you'll ever have a conversation with but odd in the best possible way so one time I was with him it was my wife me and Sam ens we're sitting at um we're at a party or something and him and my wife get along great because my wife and I both love like quirky people he's extreme quirky it gets to a in the conversation where there's a 5sec silent silence where we're thinking about what we're going to say next and he looks at my wife and he goes uh I delivered my baby and and we both look at each other and like what he goes I delivered my baby and I'm like with what he goes uh my hands and then he goes on to tell the story about how his wife gave birth at home because it couldn't make it to the hospital but like he didn't laugh when he was telling any of that stuff and I thought it was so funny and he's one of the quirkiest people I've ever met but he's the type of people who I love where he's so logical that it's painful a little bit but also he's the type of guy who I think has read a book on how like normal people interact so and you could tell he's like I do care about you but I kind of have to learn a little bit how to adapt to fit your but and and you could tell that and it's endearing it makes me laugh him more he's listening to you he's like I am active listening yeah like okay got it thank you like which I love because he wants to show you he cares about you and I and I like that and it's like a really he's got a really interesting Personality yeah know the school deal is going exceptionally well we've you know five or Sixx the business in the last eight months well well break it down why do that deal it seems like you made a much bigger bet and I'm saying that because you started wearing the hat around whereas your other deals you don't promote so I'm like okay he definitely like poned up for this one and made a big bet on this so why do a SAS deal or you know why why do the school deal how how did you figure out the BET size and and was it like a butt butt clenching number and then you know what what's the plan well I'll say this so breaking down to the into into the deal components any brand endorsement for me is by far the butt clenching component of it not the cash because you only have three four brand bullets that you can use where you're going promote without becoming a shell right and so if I looked at my audience I think about the people who best monetize an audience do percentage conversion times LTV that's it so what percentage of your audience do you convert and what's the lifetime grow profit per customer and that's that's it that's the math the person who makes the most money wins the big thing that I saw with my audience is that obviously we have a a very skewed you know monetization structure because we have portfolio companies where we just make a tremendous amount on like a handful uh and then everything else like kind of doesn't matter um and do you even promote you don't even promote those others right no I don't no no the other no not at all that's just but they come inbound though so that's it still comes from content often but a huge percentage of my audience are people who want to start a business and that's probably some of the people who listen to your stuff they're people who are employees they're high up they're Executives things like that or and they or they want to start a business of their own whatever and so I was like okay so there's this entire huge part of my audience that wants to start a business and I want to have something for them and so I also don't want it to cannibalize acquisition. comom in terms of how we generate deals or things like that and so uh it had to be something that would help people start a business which in my opinion was going to be the closest match you like audience match so highest percentage conversion um it had to be a scalable thing so I didn't think a service would work given the amount of volume that we have and so I was like okay it has to be something that's a demand constraint not some plot constrainted it's like okay and ideally if there's something that we can create some sort of network effect and some sort of hunting you know machine within it and it has to be at the right point in the life cycle of the business right if if if you're uh you know day day you know day a thousand at Facebook is probably too late you know what I mean to get in on Facebook at any appreciable percentage right um and also where I would have less leverage and less value to add uh to a company of that size and so school was a big company uh in terms of its value and the rounds that they had done already um but I also have a really big brand um and so it took you know Sam and I call it nine months um to work out kind of every component of the deal there it was in my opinion it was the best deal I've ever done not in terms of like winning over anything like that it was just it's a it's a really elegant deal the way that it works which I'm not at Liberty to explain all the pieces of it but basically like we both gave a lot and we both are happy with how it's going um and so we both made commitments to the other person of what we can and can't do like if if someone's going to come on and uh you know be an ad from school like I have to be okay with it because I have a strong association with that um and things like that right it's like there's how can I M mitigate this risk how can you mitigate that and so to Circle back to the original question why did I do the school deal I felt like I had 70% of the audience that I have because there's always way more people who want to start a business than have a business especially if you make business content and so I want to have something for that audience that I that met all those other requirements and I knew Sam um and Sam told me about school two weeks into him starting school and so I was kind of like well it's I mean I'm not going to try and bet on a platform at day one that's why that's where Sam has just massive balls I think on our on our podcast I think he said he I think he said he spent $10 million of his own money to fund the business and I think he also said that was the bulk of all his money yeah it was I mean I think he's been public about it and then he and then he still raised another five to still keep continue reinvest in the business and when I saw the metrics of school it has everything that you want it had viral organic glare it was compounding you know 20% every single month month over month over month and I was like this thing's a [ __ ] monster and it was right at that point where he's like we need to grow and I was like okay I need a product and so it was a perfect match and um it's worked really well that's great what last time you were on you were talking about how like you started doing minority deals then you sort of realize like damn we're creating on the deals that win we create so much value the you know you basically wish you owned more on anything that works and you're like maybe we'll switch to doing majority like where'd you land on that like what's the evolved thinking on that and I don't know if that relates to how you did the school deal but just in general also yeah it's almost all majority it's almost all majority like if we're going to do a minority it's got to be a massive company you know like for for us to do that I I basically have and one of the unfortunate things with content is like my my deal line has continued to move up and so like we were like I finally hit a million dollars in profit and I was like I you know like we're kind of looking at like five or 10 million in profit now like for minimum to look at because right now like the portfolio does 250 million a year we do 70 million in eida we have Consolidated like the the smallest percentage ownership we have is 20% the largest is 100 um I think our aggregate is somewhere is like 42 or something perc um if you blend all the the percentages together so we have meaningful chunks of the companies um are you like our friends we have a couple friends that are doing this and they they were talking I was talking to them about metrics and they were saying you know with a hold Co like this there's a couple different things you can go for one is just free cash flow so how much cash are these businesses spitting out and they buy cash flow businesses that's their play um they don't care as much about the equity appreciation obviously they care but first and foremost they're looking for cash flow Generation Um so they picked free cash flow and I know other people in private Equity that are you know they're looking for basically ultimately like a return on Capital invested or you know multiple on Capital invested so what do you what's the main metric for you with Acquisitions how do you measure if you're doing a good job deploying capital or not I have thought about it as deal by deal like school is obviously a appreciation play you know like that will realize all of the gains from that years into the future right whereas there's some companies that will buy that are pure cash flow deals and so it really just depends on I mean deal by deal so we have like a mandate which is one of the reasons you know I haven't had LPS because I just look because the nature of having inbound deal flow is like we get weird deals and so some of them are very interesting um they have to buy out a partner uh and it's like this weird terrible situation but no one else wants to get into it but like we're operators and so we're happy to get into it so we can get really good valuations and maybe we get both um in terms of cash flow but like I'd say like for us in cash flow we're probably on pce to do 40 in cash flow just like our slice for the year that's incredible and how much Capital did it take to get to that right because that's the that's the skill that's the Finesse if if it takes a billion dollars to generate 40 of cash flow that's one thing if it took 50 million to generate 40 that's incredible right not a lot and it's been mostly because um what Lea and I have realized in this process is that we're better at building better at building than buying yeah so like I so I so we did 20 I did like a deal a month for like two years and of those I've gotten rid of like I basically just like here's your Equity I don't even care to like 80% of them and then we just we just basically did an 8020 because it wasn't worth the time I was like you can keep the cash and I will give you the equity back I don't like this it's just not worth the time anymore but like the largest two companies in the portfolio together will do 150 million and we own very large chunks of those companies with probably Consolidated some like 60 like a lot of E when when you say build you don't mean incubate like from scratch you're saying once we get in there we just do a [ __ ] ton of work and we kind of run the business yeah so like the company that's doing 110 right now which is the largest in the portfolio can you say which one no I just I just don't do I don't do any names besides school um it's a it's a b2c business um business consumer business but it started it did 2 million in trailing 12 months when we got in and so we own 29% of the business and this year it'll do on its own the between 35 and 40 million in Evena wow what was the unlock for that one what what did you guys do that cranked it up so much because that's how that's I'll tell you I'll tell you all the stuff we did so by the way you still only have 30% of it yeah I still 29% it hasn't changed so uh in the business in the beginning it was just basically a a handful of Founders that were together and they' figured out a way to to generate positive Roi on the front end uh in terms of getting customers but they had no back end can can you say category like Ecom ing like just like a general architect publishing yeah yeah it's publishing business and so they were they were getting like 3 to one up front LTV CAC and so I was like hey man wouldn't it be cool if we sold our customers something else and uh this is actually a really funny story if you guys want to hear it so we're negotiating this deal and we're like right near the end and they we all agreed we need to have some sort of second upsell some sort of backend that's going to build some sort of continuity whatever and so they were like we've already got it we've already built it all out we're super passionate about it we want to show people how to build a business like this and I was like that's not is it was b2c business it's it's like a publish like it helps publish book like things like that right and I was like this has nothing to do with what we what we do and they're like no we're passionate about it we know our customers are going to be passionate about it too if we're passionate about it and so I was like this is kind of a deal breaker for me like I don't want to do that um and they're like well it's done so I said okay and we're pretty much at at the point where we're going to walk away I said crazy idea why don't you just survey the audience and put your offer next to my offer and just see which one they want and I was like and if they want your offer more I was like I'll kill myself and we won't do this deal and I was like and if they do want it we do the deal and they were like fine if you're and so we ran it and 85% of people wanted my offer and my offer was more of that thing you just bought and so uh it was a great it was a great moment everybody came together so we did the deal and then we built out that back end which 1.9x DTV which is now now we've actually increased it say 2.2x LTV and so we kept the same 3 to one but we we were able to 5x advertising in terms of how much we could advertise and spend so we could be profitable which is basically I mean this is just like uh like any digital marketer who's been in the game for 10 years or you know like this is like the this is the game this is pretty standard [ __ ] yeah but every business owner has blind spots right yeah of course so many business I look at it's like oh yeah we have 5x row as it's like cool why aren't you spending more yeah they don't have an answer it's not like they have some complicated reason that they don't they're like I don't know haven't really thought about it yeah or they get romantic about it and they're like well we don't want to we don't want to like Market it too much we'll be annoying I read this thing that said we need to have this margin it's like no no no dude you do this for two years you get 10x bigger right like you know there's a story they tell themselves or a blind spot or hey how' you get all these customers like six months ago it's oh I used to go to these events like do you go to those events anymore no I got tired of it and then customers are gone right do you want this to grow or like what's going on here so it went from it went from uh 2 million to did 16 million to uh 50 then 70 then this year we do 110 and so we hired 40 sales guys so that we could do we could add that back end in we added a CMO we added a CPO and a p product team to help the the chief product officer out we added in a controller and so one of the things acis.com what we do is that we recruit and so because we have a lot of inbound we have a lot of talent that is in my audience and so I I might not endorse the company publicly but from a private perspective we'll endorse we'll we'll recruit at holdco get usually higher quality Talent than a portfolio can get place the high quality talent and then they just grow way faster well why wouldn't you recruit that or promote that company why wouldn't I it's because I don't want the keepy well one I don't like promoting lots of things so that's a big thing for me because I don't want to promote lots of stuff um it's one that I am considering to be fair but like it couldn't handle the amount of volume that I can send now and now it it's probably close because we actually built a SAS component of that business and now the software is doing about 50% of the revenue in that business and so that's going to be a monster deal but the the point there is that like we took the team from like a handful of dudes with like some vas right into now the company's got you know 100 employees and like a whole leadership Suite A whole Executive Suite it's a company you know what I mean and that just took a lot of work in four and a half years and so our first kind of batch of deals that we did we have our handful of winners that have come from that what did you pay for that by the way the 30% how much cash did you put up up front like almost nothing I say like a negligible amount relative to what we do now so you made tens of millions of dollars in value potentially more in four years and and you made it for everyone it sounds like yeah dude I want to normalize this because I think this is really cool so I just did this I just ran our stats this uh this last weekend um our average founder return on Equity so post deal how much more is their Slice worth like every PE buyer says listen and you could make more on the second B right it's everyone's like the same pitch right so our average founder return on Equity net of the chunk that we now own is 13x yeah that's silly that's silly that's crazy right so it's like at that point I like you should pay me well dude so so I did a deal that was similar I can talk about it now because the numbers have come out a little bit which was this deal that at the time was called Shephard and now it's called someware so it's someware docomo you know in the US that same role for a developer might be 150 Grand 180 Grand a lot of business owners don't want to do that they're trying to be more profitable in that yeah so Nick was in the business and then I wanted to join a I like that blueprint so I was like okay that's a business I'm either going to start I'm going to buy into I'm going to do something I tested all the services out and I was like okay I like this one um so I approached Marshall and cut a deal that I thought was so good for me which is my objective when I do a deal is it has to be good for me I'm not going to do a deal that's bad for me but I want it to be good for both sides but if I'm being honest in my heart of hearts I was like I think this is a good deal for him and a great deal for me yeah turns out I had it like totally flipped so what ended up happening was we put in a small amount of money and then actually you know but the business was already making millions of dollars a year of profit and so I was like I can't value you this low but I'm bringing value that's not cash so how are we gonna do this and they were like look how about we do this this was Nick's idea actually Nick was like the business will loan you the money to buy your shares and I was like sick okay you're gonna give me the money to buy my buy you all right sign me up you know say say no more and so and that's that's when I was like okay this is an incredible deal for me and it's you know a really good deal for them because I knew I was going to grow the business I didn't know exactly by how much and by how long it would take and all that and what ended up happening was at the time I think Marshall had an opportunity to sell the business something in the range of let's call it like 15 million bucks that's what he's looking at he didn't want to sell he believed in the business so he decided not to sell but he had gone out looked at opt offers and that was like kind of where where a realistic deal might have got done a year later now the numbers came out so it basically they uh you know the buyout happened at a $52 million valuation so in in less than a year so basically like I don't know nine months of time the business went from being worth 15 million to 52 million and so I thought I was getting this incredible deal on My Equity actually Marshall got like by far like the most value out of the deal in less than a year and the only thing that changed was me coming in and and you know being able to help the business in in different ways and so um that way and I realized oh [ __ ] that's the metric that matters because like of course I'm always going to protect my bottom line to try to make this work but the only way that this model Works long term is if the founders get a stupid return on Equity after my split and YC does the same thing YC which uh they used to get a lot of [ __ ] because they would give you 20 the original deal was like $118,000 like 6K per founder in a company um and they would take six or seven percent and people used to be like well YC is getting in an effective like a million dollar valuation into these like future Dropbox Airbnb like those are YC companies and Paul Graham came out he's like there's a very simple equation uh you do one divided by the equity you gave me so basically it's like if you gave me 7% but I make the company worth 10% Like because you gave because I'm now involved in the company the company's worth 10% more it was a good trade you would do that all the time and obviously they add a lot more than 10% so it became kind of a no-brainer it was it was a different lens to look at than just totally valuation which I think is where most Founders get you know stuck on either due to Shark Tank or just whatever that's the the general parlance it's just is this the right Val am I getting a fair valuation or not versus if I gave you 10% of equity but I knew you'd triple the the value of my business of course I would take that 100% of the time right right and then the risk that's Associated is what if you don't do anything and so then you Covenant around that I think I'm a big I'm a big personally I love performance stuff um because I know I'll hit it and so people tend to be like well if we hit that I'm like cool like if you're good with that right I'm good with that Sam you're were smirking am I high on my own Supply or what what were you laughing at you're not high on your own Supply no I I like it I think that um so we're we're glamorizing this this the buying of businesses because Alex you're doing it wonderfully and Sean you told the story of doing it wonderfully whenever I hear these stories I'm like this sounds awesome and then I get into the nitty-gritty and I'm like I hate this I love starting stuff from scratch like I get so much more joy like crafting the brand and putting my personality into it and like calling customers on the phone early on and like hearing like it's like you're comedian I'm practicing my bits to hear what like what works well I love that so much more uh than having to buy things um because I just think it's it makes my soul feel better and now we could debate all day if the numbers make sense for you and both those examples that you guys gave the numbers like make so much more sense and and it's it's hard to create that much value in four years starting something from scratch and so what I want to know do you feel that way I mean you're you you started something for like do you ever like get a little bit of that Vibe when you're starting something from scratch so the artist regret the artist regret yeah you're like dude I'm producing all these artists I'm not actually writing songs you know what I'm saying I I miss that art that it's actually more like the analogy would be like a label you're a label sure than you get to go be in the in the studio I get that I would say first off I do consider myself a businessman so if I were to like give myself a tit I feel like that's probably most appropriate that being said I do get a lot of the stuff that I like a lot which is the big picture decisions which is like what big bets are we going to make like I love that stuff like okay we have we like what's our one big bet for the year and then spending a tremendous amount of time doing research and being like okay this is where we're going to go and this is how we're what's an example of a bet you made a year and a half or two years D the software component for the publishing business so it was not that it was basically a consumer service business fundamentally like education and service whatever and it was I think the revenue is 50-50 split between the two and so it's like we have to put some sort of software thing in here that we can facilitate so either we get a tech enabled service mulle just get a pure SAS multiple um and so it was a year and a half ago um and we started putting a few million dollars into developing the software that now has just had a tremendous uptake rate has improved conversion rates improved client success scores all of these things um and that was a bet you know I mean to be fair for a company of that size even when we made the bet I think we were doing somewhere like 20 million in EB would have made the bet something like that um so you know betting 10% or 15% of net free cash is not like a massive bet but from a resources perspective of the attention of the leadership team that was where the big bet was and so kind of like the point with the brand versus the cash like if I'm going to do a deal and I promote it the biggest the biggest slice that I'm giving is is the audience and the attention not the cash what's a company you would want to go buy right now let's say you had the money today what type of company would you go buy I probably want to buy a big Professional Services business what's that mean business Plumbing so payroll financial services for business like accounting tax like the things that every business has to have um I like those businesses I I mean I love service businesses even though 40% of our portfolio software I still like service tech enabled service like and I still see software as software as a service like I just I feel like I get those types of businesses because there's so many things where my skill set of like tweaking pricing and figuring out sales process and demand gen like that's where I'm pretty good and so there's the businesses that I make a huge impact on I got one more question for you which is what are you trying to figure out because uh one trap you could fall into is like you're the advice guy it's like here's the guy who turns on the camera and gives everybody advice all the [ __ ] time which is like inherently somewhat of a know-it-all position which is dangerous on the audience side of like eventually people start to resist that but also more importantly for yourself you're like you got where you got because you were the student and now you're getting good benefits of being the teacher but you still want to be the student and so I'm curious where are you still the student right right now like what are you trying to figure out what are your unanswered questions that you're you're noodling on that maybe maybe even we could help you out or or kind of help you talk through those I would say the big things that I'm still like green on are the fund World raising Capital like LPS like I don't have any experience with LPS I've always done my own my own money I don't use debt I will probably use more debt in the future I just haven't um so those are all things that I am kind of more spending time on that being said like to be very candid with you I feel like and Sam and I talk other Sam uh Sam partner of mine and I talk about this which is like there's periods of figure it out and then there's periods of do like I'm in a period of do right now uh and then when I get to a constraint because right now the plan of like grow more media grow the companies has been working and so I want to do more better not new and so I'm going to continue to do more better until more better stops working and then I will look at something new so like in terms of where I see my deficiencies from the private Equity perspective uh LPS and debt um are things that I would say that are are weaknesses of Mind in terms of understanding just because I've used my own Capital but in terms of limiteds for the business right now um I think the biggest threat is always focus and so that's why I try and say no to everything except coming on this podcast because we're your boys dude you're the man you guys are the man I I'm happy you're feeling healthy you're looking good as always we appreciate you is that the Pod Sean that's it

one thing that I don't think anybody really talks about it's kind of touchy feely but every single successful person I know has a story like [Music] this all right Sam I want to do a short episode that is about one specific topic Believers so a lot of Founders I know are interested in getting investors getting advisers I'm sure you get hit up a lot in your email for either hey will you invest in this will you advise in this so I think everybody needs somebody in their career usually in your early 20s that believes in you more than you believe in yourself at the time they they just have an irrational belief you're a penny stock but they see you as a blue chip and they want to buy up all your stock and they do that by spending time with you by spending effort with you sometimes investing you sometimes advising you but it's not the advice it's not the money that actually now in hindsight when you look back is what matters the thing that really mattered was this person believed in you more than you believed in yourself at the time they almost trick you into believing in yourself or to just going forward and overcoming that initial like hesitation or doubts to just get going to where finally your evidence will start to catch up and eventually you're fueled by your evidence and you're fueled by you know your your own self-belief but it's like jumping jump starting a car that there's people in your life who do that I've you know I've never talked to you about this I I know a couple people my life that did this I want to hear did did you have this I had this with a couple people first of all my wife I felt like she was like doing the same thing when I met her uh she was like picking stocks she picked a good one I I hope yeah I had two the first one was Scott belly so Scott bsky currently is the chief product officer of adobe soon to be CEO I think and he's probably a billionaire because he's has started and sold a bunch of companies and I cold emailed him when I first started my company the hustle asking him to invest and he said no and then about six or eight weeks later he was on our daily email and I got an email from him in particular when I was having a horrible day and he goes these emails are just so good I have to join and he gave me like $15,000 or something like that and I only met with Scott in person one time because Scott has always been he was a big deal back then he's an even bit bigger deal bigger deal now and he had one meeting with me where he taught me I had never heard the word Steward you know Steward like you are a steward of this Capital you are a steward of the brand and he gave me this PumpUp talk and he's like you are so like I could tell you are going to be a steward of of the hustle and a steward of my money and anyone else's money your customers you have this and and I remember thinking it changed my life the fact that Scott bsky believed in me and he used this word steart I was so into it the second person was Tim Ferris so I have told the story before but basically I met Tim Ferris because he lived near me in San Francisco and we would walk our dogs at the same time and just talk about neighborhood stuff well well a few weeks after we first started talking I get an email from Tim saying hey I know what the hustle is it looks really cool could we meet and get dinner and I can ask you a little bit about email because I want to start a newsletter and I was like yeah sure let's do it man and so we go out to dinner in our neighborhood and I get down to sit at dinner and he goes oh you are the dog owners guy you are the same guy and I was like yeah man what's going on because I never told him what I did for work when we would walk our dogs together because I wanted him to think I didn't want to bother him because he was like a celebrity to me and I didn't want to ruin that relationship and it was awesome the fact that this guy wanted to meet with me and I he was like what you guys are doing is so smart so Innovative and I was like it's not that interesting he's like no it is and he like bought into me and he believed in me and that was such a big deal to me that he gave me the time of day just even just a dinner it was like gamechanging where I was like I'm the man I'm the man I'm the best like there is no one better than me and I had that like energy because of those two meetings and was it just like a temporary high that that Fades you know 30 minutes later or do you feel like that planted some kind of seed in you it planted a seed because then I would look at Scott and Tim's other endeavors you know they did some amazing stuff and it felt good you know how when you go to a website and you see someone who puts your logo on their website to brag that they use you you go to like hubspot.com and like Nike it says like Nike uses and I felt so much gratitude that I was one of the logos on their websites and I remember like thinking that I'm like look like this person picks a bunch of winners and I happen to be part of this basket I I feel honored and so I would use that for a long time of like go to his crunch face profile he list the hustle as an investment I remember thinking like I was so special and I used that for fuel for a long time dude that's a that's a great story have you done that for anyone else do you think yeah look you and I have done it together on this podcast when we call people out and I think like for example Michael from our future this kid who was probably 20 years old when he cold emailed you and I to make videos for us and we loved his energy but I think that like you and I both bought into him a little bit where like your energy is so good or same with Dylan and Henry yeah I think you and I have done it together who bought in who bought yours so I'll give you three quick quick examples the first one is a woman named Lisa kter Lisa keester is a professor at duger she was at the time I have no idea what she's doing now it's a good reminder to look her up and drop her a note I took a class my last year at Duke I was a pre-bed student I had taken the mcats I was ready to go to bed school and my my last semester I said I should take a class with my two best friends like we've never it's crazy we're friends through college we live together we've never taken a class together and we decided let's take the easiest class we can I was so burned out from studying for the mcats I just wanted something that was the easiest class we looked it up on rate by professor.com and it was like the easiest class is a class called getting rich sounds good good good title and she was just click baiting us like it was a personal finance and Entrepreneurship class but getting rich sounds a lot better and she was a woman who she had a crazy story she graduated from duke with a degree in Mandarin cuz that's what she was interested in she just followed what she was interested in and she told us she's like I remember at the time feeling completely clueless what the hell I'm supposed to do with my life because all my friends were going to law school banking whatever I didn't want to do those but it just felt like school was just giant like pipe that just dumped you out in New York or LA or San Francisco in one of these tracks and I wasn't on one of the tracks and I felt bad about myself and I realized you know people were like what the hell are you gonna do with this Mandarin degree good luck with that and she's like I bet I can figure something out in China so she just moves to China one-way ticket ends up building a great business they connecting Chinese companies with American companies because she spoke both languages anyway she got super rich in the process retires by 30 comes back Duke to teach and so the reason she bet on me or believed in me early was she was not an investor she really wasn't even an adviser she was a Believer we had this terrible idea to start a sushi restaurant chain we were like why isn't there a Chipotle for sushi and we were like we'll do it even though we had no restaurant experience no sushi experience no nothing and everybody I talked to every adult every grownup that I looked up to was basically like restaurants equal fail doing a startup versus going to med school I don't know man like are you sure like you just got accepted in like you should just go and she was the only one who was like this sounds awesome you could totally do this and at the time I took that as she believes in our idea we have a good idea and I wish I could say that she believed in us but she didn't even really know us that well she was actually just such a big believer that if you just do the most interestes thing the most exciting thing and ambitious thing for you in your life at the moment works out she was just a believer in the path more than even us but at the time I interpreted it as she thinks we're going to win she thinks this is a good idea and that this is going to work and so even false belief will work it it'll fuel your engine for a while not only false belief but just her one conversation with you which she does not remember and at the time she was like what I'm saying is not important this is no big deal and conversations like that make such a big impact every once in a while you know I mean it's like when your kid draws something and they show it to you and it looks horrible but you're like this is awesome oh my god did you how did you think of this or like whatever like are those two colors that that because of this and you make them feel like they're a artist she did that for me except I was 18 years old I was 22 years old or something 21 years old and she looked at my shitty business plan and she was like that's awesome you could totally do this and I it fueled me and So Lisa keer was the first one and she it was genuine by the way there was no like BS in it I think she genuinely had that level of enthusiasm and excitement about it and it was contagious it cannot be faked when somebody's genuinely excited for you all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show the second person was this guy named John Pendergrass so we got into some accelerator you're supposed to get assigned with a mentor which is the most fake way you can get a mentor it gets assigned to you and this guy put in a request he goes I want these guys and it was because he himself although now he was doing some fintech company his first business was he was a franchise of Boston Market and he was like oh these guys are doing a restaurant thing I can help them out and he helped us out in two ways the first was he gave us real talk so he took us into we came to his office and he was like so what's the plan and we told him the whole business plan we gave him the pitch we' practice a million times then he goes is this gonna work or or not and just him asking us that way like Jarred me and I was like I have no idea which is like not what you're supposed to say when you're pitching or investors or employees or anybody really supposed to just say of course this going to work here's the research here's the studies here's why here's the plan I was like dude I have no idea and he goes so you probably shouldn't sign a lease the 10 you know a personal guarantee at a 10e lease right if you don't know if this concept's going to work he's he goes how can you figure out if the concept's going to work he just asked a better question like instead of where should we launch like what location should we go for he's like how do you figure out if this is even worth doing if people want this and he got us think and he got us to eventually do like a cloud kitchen and so he helped us that way but the thing he did afterwards was much more valuable after we so he he talked to us for about an hour and the bad news was we were dumb the good news is we knew we were dumb whereas there's a lot of 21y olds who are dumb but they think they're smart we had the one asset which was we thought we were pretty dumb and so when somebody told us a good idea or somebody seemed smarter than us we actually took them up on it and so he told us to do these three things or think about these three things so we just immediately went and did those three things and then four days later we were like hey John we did those four things here's what we learned here's what we're going to do next and so he was like these guys are great which is now that I'm in the position where sometimes I give people advice that never happens like it seemed like the obvious thing to do but actually that rarely ever happens rarely do people ask a question genuinely want the answer then take take good advice and and act on it and come back and say here's what happened they Clos the loop and say here's what happened here's what we're going to do next and so he wrote this blog post and what he said in the blog post I don't believe was true at all at the time but dude that was like a gust of wind in our sales he goes I met these Founders and I've met a lot of Founders probably 100 Founders and I've given a lot of advice these guys they took what I said they acted on it immediately violently and he goes one of the most important things for an entrepreneur is a high bias for action and these guys a named us and he goes they have the highest bias for action of anyone I've met in the last 10 years and I was like I didn't even know that phrase It's kind of you like you're talking about Steward like I had even heard bias for Action that was not a phrase I'd ever heard but I was like put that label on my back that's me now I you know I was a blank canvas before that I was an empty vessel and him giving me that label became kind of like calling cards like yo I don't I don't know what the right act what the right answer is but I know that how I do things is I have a high bias for Action so I'm just going to take a ton of action and I'll figure things out that way and so he gave us a real gift in that moment which was again not really true but it didn't matter it was true in my mind and therefore he gave me something to strive towards which reminds me of your your bsky story so check this out so John is a an entrepreneur I guess he um I think he has a podcast too I found I don't know if you want people to see this I found an old Sean website that is basically your resume and on your website and on this website it has references and you've got one from John I would bet on these guys in almost anything they have the highest bias to action of any entrepreneurs I've met in the past few years and then it links off to this blog post uh that he wrote about you which is insane in the blog post he has a conversation that you guys had together and uh it's pretty funny exactly so he is uh so that was the second one and then the third one is Michael Burch Michael Burch he was the guy who was what I wanted to be he was a Silicon Valley billionaire built multiple successful companies was living the life had a cool office in San Francisco and I came I moved to San Francisco to work with him and so I I worked with him and eventually he ended up promoting me he was the CEO at the time I was the junior guy in the company I was 24 years old probably youngest guy in the company and he actually promoted me to CEO which was insane this is you know like a 18 person company at the time and it wasn't that he promoted me is it was the speech he gave he he took me off site and I thought I was getting fired because that's what I had seen in movies is they take you like out to coffee because they want to like shoot you in the head out there and not cause a scene in the office so I I texted my mom I was like oh no he wants to meet offsite like I'll be home for lunch you know it's over had a good run it was fun but whatever I was doing there making it up as I went I did something wrong he sat me down it was him his wife and he goes you know when you meet somebody sometimes you just know and I think he's talking about his wife and he goes I met a lot of people at Silicon Valley I know now I win somebody special and they're going to do something special in their career he goes you're either going to do it here or elsewhere so I want to give you the keys to have you do it here and I was blown away you know it was like a astrology reading like it it didn't mean anything there was no evidence there was no logic there was no explanation no rationale but him just saying you're going to do something special uh you know that fueled me I I I then failed for like six years straight right after that um which felt horrible because this guy believed in me and I just felt like I couldn't deliver this like you know billion dollar company that I was supposed to but that fueled me for a very long time dude this more than anything inspires me to give these speeches to other people yeah I'm just gonna go willy-nilly baby everybody's getting a fortune cookie from me from now on can I just tell you one of the funnier things that I've seen this week so on Sean's this looks like Shawn is like a year out of college on or he's 24 years old on your website which I assume is your resume basically you have your height and weight listed so it says Shan Pur 24 years old 6 foot 167 pounds of pure hustle yeah dude I I didn't know how Twisted Twisted steel and sex appeal like you're just like you've listed your height and weight on your resume and you said I live on a stage run on fumes and I'm willing to take big risks oh my God that is so funny when you're the greatest founder in the world they don't call you the greatest founder they call you Sean pory yeah I didn't know how to make a resume I didn't know what you were supposed to do so I just like thought from first friend like what would I do and I it was it's like half NBA draft Scouting Report like my height my weight I did you can see it on there I did a thing that was like you'll probably see this I did skills ball like an NBA 2K where it's like this person is like good at three-point shooting bad at dunking and I I remember I did this and the guy in the interview was like so I looked at your um resume if we're gonna call it that and he goes uh hard work is only like halfway full like what why would you why would you say that you don't work hard was like well true that's why dude a lot of your stuff is accurate by the way he does 24 that so over 10 years ago uh negotiations was high design medium programming nothing public speaking almost 100 out of 100 you had attributes son you you you knew exactly I me you were on point writing High uh this is such a funny website this is so funny yeah organization under 50 like like on the scale of zero to 100 my organizations are 40 that's true you know that where's my hard work my work ethic okay gave myself like a 70 whereas like you know improvisation I gave myself a 90 this is accurate at least I I told no lies this is so funny and then you have like a collage of all the stuff and it says hot off the press and it has it's a collage of all the times that you've been mentioned in media this is awesome it's actually cool to see I bet you a lot of people who listen to this should go when when I did that my final interview with the with the billionaire he scrolled down to the bottom I had this little like motivational poster looking thing I mean it's all cringe now dude like let's let's it's not cringe it's not this is all very cringe but I'm like it's like proud cringe like when you look back and you're like oh I was a geeky in high school but like you know this kid going places that's yeah but I felt like I was going places and I had one thing on here that they got referenced as she was like you know why I like your resume the very last line on your thing said don't believe your own I like that and that like resonated with the you know the billionaire and um I was like oh man I was just throwing out the wall this whole thing was like 100 possible things that might resonate you're like uh I actually did believe my own and it worked like I just wrote all this and it got me here um that's awesome I like looking to this website by the way uh yeah Believers versus advisers I'm on board be a believer for somebody and if somebody believes in you it's a good reminder today to hit them up and thank them for it that's a that's that's the takeaway here that's it [Music]

all right can we talk about the stock market going down because I had to yell at a bunch of [Music] people so basically uh the markets dropped what 5% this week and in our little circle jerk World it felt like the world was ending so the I guess the Dow had his worst day in two years SP 500 is down about 5% so far this week as of timer recording and I think the tech stocks did a bit worse so nvidia's down 12% Google you know whatever a couple of the tech stocks which is more maybe where our where we we are at in a bubble did worse they gave back a lot of the gains that they've been having so far this year and so it it was a bad day for the markets and by the way I wake up I wake up and I think some people on the East Coast you're on the East Coast couple people in the group chat on the east coast and it either says one of two things it says the world is ending with four or five likes on it in our group chat or it says we're going to Valhalla boys and it has four or five likes on it every morning and I really I don't even check the market I just look at that text and I know directionally is the arrow up or down but it kind of gets to you that that that way of think it bothers me I had to yell at my partner Joe because he just calls me are you freaking out about this I'm like freaking out about what he's like the markets are just going down like crazy like should we sell everything like what do we do like my reaction was just like this is expected like if you if you just buy index funds like I do like there are ups and downs but in general over 5 10 20 year periods you you're expected to to to go up and down and he just like freaked and I and it made me angry like it made me angry because I was like I wasn't stressing but now I am and this is not healthy and that's what happened okay so I had a similar experience Ben calls me I'm on vacation so Ben calls me and he's like dude what what are your thoughts on like you know the market like first first of all are we only going to do calls when the market crashes uh about the market it's not a topic we normally discuss okay so first of all I have no thoughts it reminds me of that skit um back in the the Dave shabelle skit where he where it was like what do J Rule thing what's John to say about this event got get joh on the line what's yeah let's get John on the line let's talk about the market second thing he was like he goes yeah I we should probably do that thing but uh you know I did think like maybe we should do XYZ and like laid out some like new plan and the funny thing is I have been in a mode where I've just been trying to I I've I've understood that one of the most powerful things you could do is take a simple idea very seriously I'm actually gon to do a whole episode on this taking a simple idea seriously but in general picking a few things that matter and then just simply doing them as well as possible and and reinforcing it so I actually do a thing which is I wrote out for the year I said here's the three big things big shifts I always call it like three shifts I'm making this year I'm making this shift this shift and this shift those are the three things that need to change in my life the rest of things are going great I don't need to talk about the things that are going great and every single week I write down that shift again in our slack I retype the exact sentence and then I say what I'm doing today and how that ties to that shift and if I'm GNA do something today that doesn't tie to that shift I just simply don't do it um or with very rare exceptions to it so I've been doing this for a while now and I told Ben I was like Ben so remember that that thing we've been saying over and over again about like what we're doing this year why we're doing it why it's the right plan did we need to add a disclaimer which was unless the stock market crashes and then we're just GNA throw all the [ __ ] out the window and suddenly change our decision- making about all the things that we're doing H and it sounds ludicrous to say it like that but that's where his mind went in the moment and I don't blame him because my mind used to go there too and I've I've developed a set of rules for myself through making horrible expensive mistakes which is fundamentally when markets crash just I have to assess like a is the wolf at the door like do I actually have an existential crisis if so okay I'll I'll I'll make a I'll shift my attention to this and and change but like if that's the case it's because I somehow over levered or like really stretched myself too thin or like I've made a huge bet that I should have never made in the first place so is the wolf at the door no okay if the wolf is not at the door simply do not react just do nothing for 30 to 90 days and then see where you land how would you have reacted 5 years ago well I can tell you how I did react 5 years ago making mistakes so when covid actually even before covid I remember at the end of maybe 2019 2020 we had just sold our company and my cousin who's a hedge fun guy and really all I know is like this is my cousin he's a hedge fun guy and our whole family thinks he's the smart stock market guy you know people like in your family when you don't really understand what people do you just boil them down you just categorize them into he's the doctor so no matter what my issue is let's call the doctor even he's a hard doctor I got a foot issue doesn't matter that's the doctor yeah I'm The Tech Guy it's like whether your router doesn't work or you need a you're you're making a startup investment just call Sean well this is the stock guy and he was like uh you know it's been a long bull market I'm moving this this and this and so I went to cash and you know I was like hey you know longest bull market in history I I'm gonna shift some my allocation around because I got this one hot tip from my cousin the stock market isn't that funny how uh when you phrase it as wonderfully as we're in the longest bull market ever you're like I don't know any of the evidence but that was a great line I'm in exactly exactly he told me something about a dead cat bounce damn that sounds fancy What's that I'm Googling it's like if any time I'm making decisions off a Wikipedia article I just read like bad things were happening in my life um when covid happened I'm you know it's like I don't know Global pandemic the world is ending and people are talking about L-shaped recoveries or uh w-shaped recoveries or whatever the hell like v-shaped recoveries I don't know what what's going on I'm drawing on my notepad trying to figure out oh that means stock market goes up or just stays down by the way you know what it ended up being a k-shaped recovery the letter they didn't even talk about at the time I was listening to all the smart money and it turn a k-shaped recovery where you know main stream main stream went down and just got bogged down by inflation and assets soared and people you have a k like doesn't there's multiple lines on that chart I guess up and down or when they talk about um like flattening the curve I'm like I literally have to draw like an axis I'm like wait so what does flatten like what does that mean by the way the dumb thing isn't drawing it out and trying to understand it that actually is the smart thing to do it's taking you know uh poorly informed action actually was the mistake and so I ended up doing a bunch of things that I really never should have done I sold a bunch of things thinking that that was being safe and conservative but it was actually a poor decision in general the number of poor decisions I've made simply from reac ing versus responding and I Define a reaction as making a decision in the moment based on an emotion that I'm feeling usually fear or greed responding being I have let the emotion cool off I have let that settle and I am now choosing a decision uh that I'm going to make based off of some sort of logical rationale that I could write down and I could write down the counterargument for it and I when I look at my argument for and my argument against one of them wins um and so anyways now now that's the the short version of my the current my current fases which I do not um claim to be foolproof but it's just a improvement over over dumb mistakes I made in the past I found this great chart I think it um was like starting in 1990 or 94 this chart breaks it down to if you missed the top gaining days of a market what would your portfolio be like versus what would your portfolio be like if you just set it and forget it and it was something like what was this uh I think the starting number was $10,000 and so like if you missed the 30 best days uh you would have only uh $30,000 if you missed the which is roughly 83% less than if you just said it so if you just said it and forget it you would have 181 if you missed the 30 best days You' have 30 grand and then if you missed the 10 best days you would have 83 Grand you know what I mean like you would like see this chart of like if you miss it now I posted that chart and people are like yeah well now do that chart with uh Missing the worst days and I'm like well you'd have way more money but like if you have some magic balls that that could tell me like you know get that P vter guy with the huge balls maybe he could tell me like where's the worst day that I could time it and we're good you know what I mean but like like tell me where I'm gonna die and I'll know not to go there yeah like that's type of situation and so I'm team like set it and forget it I also think that you have to look at vti the the Vanguard Total Index Fund we're still up like eight or 10% year to date even with this little crash so so like I still feel good okay great uh good segment anytime I talk about the the stock market or um it reminds me of like anytime a you know a tech VC suddenly as like a foreign policy expert or is like pandemic expert or whatever you know I I'm I'm a novice when it comes to investing outside of my my realm which is basically my realm is starting businesses or investing in private startups um those are the two things I actually you know have spent enough time in to feel like I I know I'm talking about anything beyond that I'm better off sticking to a um you know an 8020 type of strategy where I just just do just avoid huge mistakes and don't try to beat everybody yeah and if you look at how many hedge funds beat the market it's something like 5% of them and so these are companies that have thousands of nerds just sitting around a computer to try and like beat the index and they still like the vast majority of them struggle and so that like whenever I see that stat I'm like yeah don't try that all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this pre premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show all right dude I got to ask you about the Olympics so you're my Olympics guy and I am famously not an Olympics guy I I like watching him to be honest with you I just think the Olympics are are an insane an insane sport but I emailed you as part of my Friday newsletter thing and I was like dude what should I be watching for and you gave me a couple of tips a couple of storylines that made the Olympics I don't know 10 times more interesting for me and I want to talk to you about a couple of the things that you you brought up starting with this 1500 meter race how good was that a race I did not even know I cared about I didn't even honestly know this event existed but can you set this up because you gave me storyline I needed uh to to really care about this and it was incredible all right so going into the 1500 met so the 1500 meter is uh 109 M short of a mile so roughly 15 seconds of a mile so a really fast mile let's say it's four minutes uh a good 1500 it's 3 minutes 44 seconds going into the race there was two clear favorites this guy named yakob Engel britson so basically this guy I call him the Justin Bieber of track and field so he was raised by his father and like I think he has seven siblings of which two or three others are also Elite Runners not as good as him but uh Elite Runners and so he's raised in this family with his dad who's very disciplinarian and he's also his coach and he's like they're raised to be great Runners and in Norway where he's from they have a TV show so they're almost like uh reality TV stars also in Norway because these uh three brothers are wonderful at running so this guy is the best he's been the best since he was like 18 uh he has I think the second fastest or third fastest mile time of all time he has the world record in the two mile the problem with them he's kind of a pretty boy he's got these like cute tattoos all over his body and all the runners are a little bit arrogant and Co cocky you have to be like that in order to be one of the best athletes in the world but his Cockiness comes off as more arrogance and it also kind of sucks because he's like this guy who's kind of been the best since he since he was young and so he's not easy to root for you know he's like the guy who's had it all and is the man but he kind of acts like the man now the other guy he was going to race against this guy named Josh Kerr I've been lucky enough to meet Josh in Austin one time because I was friends with his manager was this was this the guy you asked to see his Cavs or to touch his Cavs or something yeah yes yes the the so Josh I think he's from Wales I I forget or no Scotland sorry is it Scotland whatever it is it's part of the UK and so they they run under British flag and so he is more of a silly quirk like he's got like the British like [ __ ] kind of attitude that's very likable and interestingly if you the reason I talked about his Cavs unlike a lot of the runners he's still a really skinny guy he's not as skinny as the other Runners and so he kind of sticks out but he's like the man and leading up to this race they've been talking trash to each other constantly and track of field is usually a gentleman sport no one talks trash and that kind of is one of the reasons why it's boring they talk trash going into this race and so it was like framed as Josh and yaka versus each other Josh is typically slower but he all he usually wins races because when in Championship racing it's not always the fastest person who wins it's the person who shows up that day and has the best tactics and comes through in the end because oftentimes they go sort of slow and then the second half of the race is really fast so it's typically not who's fastest it's just who performs that day so we go into this race and it's just those two we think that's what's going to happen it comes down to the last uh 200 meters which is a half a lap so the last half a lap it's setting up exactly like we thought where yakob is in front winning the race because he's the faster runner and Josh CER behind him waiting to kick and beat him and Josh takes off and he's about to get yakup and out of nowhere this American Cole Hawker who's got the slowest time of most all of the other eight runners in the field comes out of nowhere and he wins and not only does he win with a 100 meters left that's the last straightaway he's boxed in between Josh and yakob and you see him try to take off and Jacob or yakob is kind of blocking him a little bit so he kind of pushes him a little bit but he loses his momentum and that's really hard in running because accelerating is the hard part so when you lose the momentum typically that's your one and only chance to do it somehow yakob goes just to the right a little bit so Cole Hawker can slip right through him on the inside Rail and he beats him and not only does he beat him yakup Fades to Fourth which is like insane Josh Kerr gets second and this guy Cole he doesn't just win he runs the world uh the Olympic record so the fastest time ever in the 1500 meter and he runs something like the seventh fastest time in the 1500 meter ever and he crushes his PR and it was one of the best races I've ever seen that was a great summary uh a couple of the things that I thought were fascinating about this so when he was doing the trials and the like the semis like basically leading in that guy yakob had this strategy where he was so cocky he would basically just start at the very back so the race starts he doesn't really care he lets every single Runner get ahead of him and he would just hang back at the back and then like kind of the second lap third lap he would pass everybody and he would win the qualifiers and it was just a cocky thing to do but it was also effective because he like he knew he could push the pace and he just didn't want to burn too much energy right at the very start the goal of the semies and leading up it's to win and qualify using the least amount of effort right exactly and in the semis him and Josh were going and it looked like at the end they both kind of were feeling each other out it looked it was the first time running felt like box where you could see oh they're they're kind of measuring each other's distance their power and they're getting a feel for each other you could tell even in the semis there was almost a moment where yakob won but Josh kind of realized like if I had pushed this last 50 meters I think I could have taken him but I don't want to show him the full bag right now they did something that was uh very controversial not controversial but it's very uh it's part of the story in running which is when you are winning a race or you're at the end of the race if you look around to see who's around you that's like a cocky move and what you do is you see yakup turn his head as if he's looking behind him it's like I see you behind me and that's like uh the ads to the the story which is always fun yeah yeah the runner's insult and so we uh and so but in the final what you were saying was amazing because he did the exact opposite he starts the race immediately in first place this guy yakob goes faster than anybody has planned in the first two laps faster than even afterwards I was reading some interviews like why did he fade so he's like dude I I went way too hard at the start accidentally like I didn't Pace myself properly I just got out you know kind of like the lost myself in the moment lost some composure he just went too fast at the beginning pushed a pace and and it was it was amazing that that part you talked about where the American dude tried to pass him got kind of pushed back it looked like it was a complete wrap for him at that point it looked like there was no way you could it bumped back and then pass him again but it ended up working out which I thought was amazing if you haven't seen that one go go to YouTube and just type men's 1500 meter watch the uh six minute clip on on the NBC Sports channel it is like straight out of a a sports movie type of thing you know like if you're an American you watch that it is uh super inspiring to see this guy who was a complete Underdog nobody was even talking about him it was just a question of which of these two other guys and then this little The Little Engine That Could basically passes them all at the very end runs the race of his life I thought that was amazing and the best part dude Paris has killed it with this Olympics the best part is they have this Bell right at the finish line of all the events and when you win an event you walk over to the bell and you ring it and he goes over and he Rings this Bell and it was just like a really cool moment so like I was all about it I was I was screaming so loud I woke my kid up from a nap I was so pumped from this so yeah I'm I'm happy I've been a distance running fan for years it's not the most popular sport because it's not that that exciting I'm happy this existed it's good for the sport okay so I have a couple other winners and losers I want to go through with you so winner for sure Cole Hawker and the 1500 meter race I'm going to do another winner here mixed relay another race I didn't even know existed didn't pay ATT did you did you watch this um so historically America's greatest event is the 4x4 relay which is a quarter of a mile one lap four people each running one lap we've we've almost always been the best the mixed relay I think it's a weird event it's I think it's only lasted for two Olympics this might be the only second Olympics that we've done it uh and America we got our ass kicked by uh was it Belgium no NE the Netherlands so the Netherlands sorry this was a hilarious race because the the way that the mixed relay Works say is is two guys two girls and they alternate so it's baton you know you're handing off the Baton the American guy gets off to a good start the woman for the for the American team is standing in the wrong spot did you see this she was standing 30 meters forward and at the last second the official was like yo what are you doing way up there you see all the other people like in her leg of the relay they're all standing literally 20 M back and she just spaced she just spaced during the Olympics and didn't pay attention to where she was supposed to stand it's like if you lined up for a kickoff at an NFL game and one dude was just at the 30 yard line and everyone else is standing somewhere else completely a debit it made no sense the last second she gets into the to the Zone where she's allowed to be so she didn't get dced which would have been horrible but then the crazy part was this at the end the fem Bowl f b is awesome FK Bowl shoes I am I am thrilled by this athlete that I didn't even know existed 24 hours ago FK bow if you haven't watched her you got to go watch this woman run she just dominated the US in the last leg she's this Dutch Runner who looks like she's not even expending any effort whatsoever she's like she's like AI dude she looked like [ __ ] chat GPT grew legs and ran effortlessly ran the the rest of this race when the rest of the humans were like sweating and trying FK Bowl dude I feel like in another life that would be your uh your your dream girl FK bull I love her I love her she is my my dream girl uh she's another life this life yeah hey fam if you're listening uh she uh so she's a 400 meter hurdle specialist and she's going to race uh this woman named Sydney mlin and Sydney's going to kick her ass uh but F's going to get second and it's still going to be a fun race that's my prediction wow okay fighting words I am uh officially I'm like a half citizen of the Netherlands after watching that race so I'm I'm in on that one that's another big winner for me that race and specifically FK bow was a huge winner can I do some losers Losers of the Olympics let me do one more winner so this is a relatively new thing so starting in 2016 I think in Rio uh something like that uh the Olympics did something cool they got all so there's a bunch of refugee athletes so uh like people who uh fled Iran like there's a wrestler who fled Iran because he uh he was protesting and and he fled and so he's can't compete for Iran anymore there's a bunch of Syrian athletes things like that uh and so what the Olympics do is they put these guys into this team I forget what they call it but it's basically the refugee team and they come into the stadium with the Olympic flag and I always cry get I get really emotional when I see these guys come in because this is like the definition of the Olympics for me um and so they like pick athletes who are refugees and who have a a shot at uh doing doing good and hitting the standards so anyway they had this one boxer who was from Cameroon and she had a flea Cameroon and it's the first time that one of these Refugee folks has ever meddled and so she's guaranteed to get third place at least maybe second place uh in boxing and so her match I think is tomorrow and so that's amazing so like a lot of these kids uh well they're young men women now but they like for example fled Cameroon or South Sudan because they were being recruited to be children soldiers things like this so they like walk across you know a country to flee and now they're in the Olympics and and that's my favorite part of the of the Olympics do they have like a so they they walk in with the Olympic flag what do they wear when they're at the Olympics I haven't seen this what what's that uniform historically they wear like blue Olympic jerseys and so they and when they come in uh to the stadium they all look different you know because there's syrians and then there's Africans and like uh they all look different and it's really cool to see this group of people who are all from all over the world but have similar like troubled backgrounds and they all like come together wearing this jersey and it's really cool to see that Jersey kind of unite them yeah I love that there by the way there's a surprising number or maybe they just stand out when you hear the story but there's a there is a surprising number of Olympic athletes who were either like foster kids or you know adopt this basically The Blindside story right it's like oh there's their parents and you're like oh that doesn't look like their parents interesting what's the story here and it's like well they they had this like incredibly tough upbringing but then it makes sense at the same time it's like if you're looking for the people who are like extremely gritty and the people who are going to you know overcome the incredible number of obstacles that it takes to become the best in the world at something it kind of makes sense that maybe you were forged in the fire that way I remember like you know I was an a track athlete and I remember being really nervous before races but you wouldn't you'd be a lot less nervous if you came from a really hard life because you'd be like this is easy dude this is like you know like this is nothing compared to what I experienc like today's a day off of my normal life for uh for a time not not running away from dictators right different Stakes yeah and so uh that's why I love sports and so what who are the losers so we got another W so the winner another winner we're marking here is the team Refugee team and my honorable winners are the uh the parents who adopted uh several of these Foster Olympians that may be my uh my future future uh career all right so some of my losers here and of course I say this playfully because they're Olympians they're not actually losers I'll give you the most controversial one first Simone biles and in general gymnastics can I give you my case can I zagged here can I give you my case on why there's something about gymnastics that just creeps me out dude there's something strange and joyless that there's not only the controversy that happened where a lot of like sexual assault stuff was going on with with gymnastics but gymnastics seems so high stress dude like when she fell on the beam and like wh there goes you know four years there's something just they have to do this fake smile while they're doing their routine but it's like the they look like the Joker dude that's that's not a real smile I've seen real Smiles that is not a real smile it just seems incredibly stressed it seems like a joyless sport and she is so dominant which is amazing but there's something uncanny about it it's like watching an AI video where you're like this looks beautiful but there's something inhuman about what I'm watching here there's something joyless about gymnastics dude is it weird that you're judged in a sport on like your appearance and your smile like I think that's weird I think that's weird like if one of these women didn't smile and just had like a plain face I think she would get hurt uh you seen our YouTube comments everybody's judged on appearance right now it's just weird that it's like sports I'm gonna get ripped for everything I'm saying and mostly the way I look I think it's weird I also dislike uh sports that are uh mostly judged you know what I'm saying that always makes me mad yeah just it's a gymnastics was a rough watch for me also can't tell the level of difficulty it all seems hard they all look they all look absolutely incredible and it's like well no this one was clearly 410 of a point worse than that one and so it is kind of an unwatchable sport also because everything that all the athletes are doing looks super human to me whereas a race there something's just so pure and Primal about a race it's like that person ran and won I could tell who won and lost in gymnastics I I really can't tell who wins and loses um at all so in skateboarding that's now an Olympic sport and I like to skate and you get points if you do so there's uh like your regular stance the way you skate all the time and then you get more points if you do switch which is you put your not dominant Foot In Front you know you switch around it's freaking weird like who cares which footed footed you are like why do you get well like what if you're like you know what I mean I always thought that's weird and it's similar with gymnastics like if you use like like who's to determine what's more challenging if you use like your less dominant hand to lead I think it's weird that's why I'm not a fan I take the SATs with my left hand do I get an extra 100 points that doesn't make any sense right or like with an ey patch I so I think that's strange okay other losers uh that I have this PV vault guy going viral because he gotta big S yeah he picked the wrong contest yeah exactly dude if I see another meme about this guy everybody had the same joke it's actually not even him it's everybody who made the same exact joke of like he actually won dude come on basically a guy went up on a p Vault he cleared the bar but on his way down his dick hit the bar and it fell over uh it sucks that sucks no he won D all right um last one is a winner Noah L uh what do you have to say about this the guy wins what seemed like the closest 100 meter race they nobody even realized that he won until it was finally like the camera in like a 90 analysis realized that his chest hair crossed the line first Noah has a little bit of a problem he's an amazing athlete I think he's a great guy he's real cringe so you'll have to if you pay attention he's gonna be run the 200 meter which is his uh better of him and he's probably gonna win because he's great he's got a cringe problem which is uh he's the you know what do we what do they call in UFC the Triple C he's the three time he's a three time Champion the third medal is for cringe yeah so he's a cringe champion no l has a little bit of an issue with that were you um surprised impressed by the uh the finish I thought that he was going to get second yeah I was surprised that he won um I was surprised that he won and here's another thing I was surprised that the Jamaican guy who got second you should look look up how big that guy is people don't realize this these 100 meter Runners and these 200 meter Runners they look jacked and ripped and they look jacked and ripped because they're like mostly naked and they're like flexing right they just you always look better when you're like working out but if you look at their body weight and their height they're pretty lean small guys they're actually like you saying bolt was 6'4 or 65 but he only weighed like 190 pounds it's actually not that not that huge of a guy the guy who from Jamaica just Beast just Beast of a guy I was shocked that he did as good as he did he's like you saying bolts Pro right he's like training with him or something well Jamaica's a small ass country they all train uh with similar coaches so no he's not good enough to be called his Protege but he's good okay fair enough fair enough um okay two questions for you number one do you believe that any of these guys are clean yes uh I tend to be optimistic I also thought Lance Armstrong was clean though so uh but I I I tend to be optimistic I think uh beating drug tests is is fairly challenging but I I think they're clean yeah right before you ask me for my investment advice I advise you to look at my per my yeah like I was like I thought Lance was clean so you know right um okay second question what's left to look forward to rest of the Olympics for me because the Olympics are also a complet the other loser is the Olympics programming how impossible this is to follow and watch if you didn't tell me hey here's three four storylines that you should pay attention to that I could get emotionally invested in it and understand what I'm looking at when I look at it and which which event to pay attention to this would been impossible to even enjoy so what's left to enjoy for me so the men's 200 will be fun so here's a sleeper uh of a an event there's a kid named Quincy there's a a grown man named Quincy Quincy Hall who's in the 400 meter dash he potentially is going to win but then there's younger Quincy who's a 16-year-old kid who looks like a 16-year- old kid you know a lot of like 16-year-old Pro Prodigy athletes they don't look like children he looks like a child he got fourth at the 400 meter trials in America you have to get top three in order to go to the Olympics but he got fourth which means he's put on a relay he's probably not good enough to be in the final 4x4 but if you watch the prelims for uh when America is in the 4x4 watch this young kid Quincy he's 16 years old he's like darling like he's got like uh the perfect type of Charisma where he's like composed but he still like talks like a child that's going to be really exciting I think he'll be the youngest uh American track and field athlete ever uh to go to the Olympics my mind only has room for Mk bowls so I really look at my notes here I've just put boxes around the name fem bow like you know 16 times as you've been talking CU I'm not really paying attention to anything except for her I mean she's good she but she's going to get her her ass beat in the 400 meter hurdles but she she'll be she's a wonderful second place winner uh so watch Quincy in the 4x4 relay prelims he'll be he'll be a runner and that will be really exciting okay one last question for you you're a runner these one of the things that they were talking about was like yeah I had to recover from that 100 meter thing to be ready for the 200 or whatever like no all is talking about this I understand that in theory but also this is a 10-second race they run it it takes nine seconds you really need two like you have two days is that really hard to recover from a NC race no so yeah it is because you get swore from that they do the so to to run a race at a big Championship you have to run three races so one one Sprint race is actually three so the quarter semi race the semi and the final are usually always on the same day so that final happened I don't know how many hours but the same day as the semi-final so he had ran that morning as well and when you run sprints it taxes your central nervous system which is different so you basically it's sort of like uh if I were to say like hey you have to do this box jump squat 20 times in a row and you got to go for Max height you're going to be this type of sore where your insides like you feel like your nerves hurt not necessarily like your Aerobic System do you know what I mean this is like how when I done with this podcast and I go hang out with my wife and I'm just like I need to just uh not talk for a while and she doesn't understand she's like you talk for a living what you TI talking you're tired from talking I need to tell I need to go with this sympathetic nervous system uh explanation just to confuse her to to make it acceptable so and that's how it feels like if you go and do like a explosive workout it's like your it's like your insides just feel depleted it's it's kind of a weird uh feeling I guess I'll take your word for it never going to do it all right um that's the Olympic segment uh thank you Sam for making that interesting for me all right so let me tell you about a story and I want to hear something uh I have a question for you on how the story ends so in 1929 there's this guy and he starts this company where it's very odd he basically is cleaning the rags and uniforms for circus performers very strange start but that's how this company starts and he turns that into a business and he calls it Acme industrial laundry and he kind of scales that up but not a lot it's a very small business but he scales it up to where he starts doing laundry for other uniform businesses now he started that in 1929 by 1960 his son who's in like 21 years old comes into the business and he's like hey Dad I would love to work for you and maybe take this over one day and the dad's like yeah sure let's do it and it does okay but inevitably there's a little little argument between the father and the son and so the father calls the son into the office and he's like hey look man this isn't working and the son's totally expecting him to be like uh you know you're fired you're out and the dad goes look this isn't working here's the keys man you run it let's see what you can do I'll step out your way let's see if you could pull this off and so this son he's at the time 21 22 23 years old his name is Richard he takes control of this business and he's like let's grow this sucker and so in 1960 when he takes it over it's doing $180,000 in Revenue which is something like $2 million today has 12 employees and he's like look we going to like focus on doing laundry for uh companies who need cleaning supplies so like extra Rags they're basically just washing rags and he grows it and it works out well and he grows it to the point where after I think eight years the business grows from $200,000 a year up to $1.6 million a year which is the equivalent of like 15 million bucks a year he's growing this business and it's a he's now expanded into laundering company uniforms which is a very strange thing to get into I didn't even know that existed listed but he grows this sucker for the next 50 years and now they've renamed a company to centas have you heard of cintus yeah I see their trucks I see their trucks all the time too and i' have no idea okay so do me a favor go to Cintas market cap just Google that and look at what it says 75 billion doll it's a 75 billion doll company and their main business is still La uh now they they laun uniforms but they also Supply the uniforms so they make uniforms for all types of businesses you know like you'll see like if you see like a typical janitor outfit that's a very easy one but it could be restaurants it could be anything and then they uh rent you your uniform and they'll launder it for you but then they've expanded so like if there's a fire extinguisher in the bathroom of a restaurant it probably has come from them if there's cleaning supplies it probably comes from them because once they made inroads into a business they're like hey along with your uniform we're going to sell you all these other things and so I think they do something like eight or n billion dollars uh a year in revenue and it's subscription Revenue so it's like a huge company why is it subscription Revenue it's Uniform Rental oh nice yeah they gotcha uh it's called Ras uh you know like rental as a service I don't know it's just that's just what they do uh they they sell uniforms or they rent uniforms and so they're able to get like these subscription businesses and then it's also like real recurring Revenue because uh they'll sell you all this other stuff and they've got inroads but as the business was taking off Richard farmer uh his name uh he starts getting old and he's like I need to figure out a way how to like keep this within my family and so to this day the family the farmer family still owns something like 20% I think maybe 18% of the business and like he was like I'm made it my mission to create this like generational thing and I've trained my children to help take this over and to make decisions as as it comes to uh giving away our money but also governing the the the company I don't a family member isn't the CEO but they're still like involved and so the reason why I look this guy up is I'm very fascinated with how you could pull this off where you could keep your family in the business I think that it's very hard and it's highrisk high reward and so I've been like studying all these families who have pulled it off and these guys have and from the outside there's a dozen other examples of people who have crashed and burned and this has not worked my question to you is this a thing that you aspire to have you know your one of your three kids uh kind of take things over or you pass the Baton to them or do you not care about this because I've talked to a lot of people and it seems 50/50 of people who are like adamantly in favor and other people who are just like I don't give a [ __ ] my answer is really split I don't aspire to do this meaning it's not something I'm planning to do or really want to push on anybody um do I think it would be awesome yeah totally in the same way where like if my son plays basketball as his favorite sport that's going to be awesome for me because I love basketball and I could coach him and I could help him in a way that I couldn't if it was tennis or not not Sports at all so it's to me it's a bonus it's not a plan I do think about this stuff because on two ends of the spectrum on one end I've met way too many Rich guys who talk themselves into working too long working too much with this like I'm just doing it all for my kids it's like dude kids just kind of want you at home actually this just want to time with you right now they they don't really care you know whether you leave them you know $12 million or $22 million or $42 million it's not like your kid right now doesn't care and also doing that giving them more might actually be a disservice to them back to the kind of you know uh conversation earlier about about the Olympics and how like you know what does uh where does character come from um so I think that it's really dangerous to talk yourself into I'm doing this for my kids so I refuse to let myself do that I think anybody who says that honestly is lying I think you're doing it for yourself um and you use your kids as a justification to uh why you're why you're doing that as my my my general opinion and so I just to safeguard myself from ever lying to myself in that way because it's such a sexy lie right who's gonna say anything bad to you you can never get checked right there's no checks and balances if you just say I'm just doing it for my family doing it for my kids and so um so I think it's really important for myself to not not lie to myself that way if my kids happen to want to be happen to have an interest or appeal to it awesome I will be super excited and can't wait to to do that I do hope that that happens but hope is you know not a plan not a strategy um on the other hand I'm on vacation and one of the best moments of my day yesterday was I went to a water park dude have you been to a water park like in the last 20 years dude Nick Gray rented a water park for his 40th birthday but in order to save money he rented it from 700 a.m. to 900 a.m. and so me and a bunch of 40-year-olds went to his birthday party uh where we had a whole water park for ourselves have you been have you been to a water park no it's just too full of pee man it grosses me out I know I was absolutely uh disgusted by being in that pool with so many people um dude sobody like twiy bird shirts and oh no not for me yeah they did this thing where they CU I'm in the kids section and they um they take a a break at the top of the for five minutes as a potty break of like hey this is the time like take your kid to go and pee that just brings more attention to it nobody left the pool and I was like nobody's leaving right now there can only be one explanation for this it's filthy besides that there was one beautiful thing amongst the disgust which was while we were walking in there's Dad he's pulling like a wagon like his when you have kids just bring so much [ __ ] everywhere and his kid was walking next to him his kid probably like s 7 years old and he's walking in front of us and he stops like 10t ahead and it's like a really Narrow Path and normally like my like flaw as a parent is I'm very impatient just I get like I get like really like fussy and like annoyed easily when I'm like Beyond like a four hour stretch with my kids I just become like cranky and so this guy stops I'm ready to be cranky they does something really really awesome I realized why he stopped it's because his kid asked him something and the dad who was the kid was like kind of like looked kind of athletic the dad didn't really look super athletic looked like you know typical water park American let's say and he but he was showing him he goes oh when you're doing that in soccer um he's like when they come at you this way what you want to do and he was showing him how to use his feet to like not have the ball get stolen and the kid was not like making eye contact but he's processing it he was watching the the dad and he was processing he wasn't saying a whole lot back and the dad was trying to just show him something and in the moment the Bas was just like a dad teaching his son something and I don't know I'm gotten pretty soft but like that like kind of like touched me for a moment I was like this is so amazing just this uh this Dad just teaching his kid this little thing like just being able to pass down one little bit of information and the kid so earnestly processing it because there's so many things you tell your kids that they're not listening and they don't care they don't want to know and they don't want to listen they don't want to take their vegetables basically um but the kid genuinely cared and it meant something to him and you could tell the kid had had like a bad experience and was trying to figure out how to overcome the bad experience and I [ __ ] fcking loved it dude and it just made me for the rest of the day I just found like all these little po little moments to like have a different conversation with my kid and so like you know later that day we were like parking the car and I was like told my son I was like come come back to me he's only three years old and I did the thing like illegal thing you're not supposed to do I like put him on my lap and like had him like Drive in the parking lot to like park the car uh but like he had to sit in my lap while I was driving it like this is like 50 feet but like whatever and I told him I said um my son does this really cute thing where he goes he'll do something and then like an hour later he'll go D you know why I do that like you know why I said I wasn't going to eat that and he just keeps he's always like you know why I punched her and it's like then he's got some explanation that never even makes sense but it's so cute and so like me and my wife whenever we fight we do that now it's like you know why my was an [ __ ] earlier is because whatever and so I told him I go you know why might let you drive just now he goes why and I go because I'm teaching you how to be be a man he goes and he goes okay and I'm like go tell your sister when you go back say you know why I got to go do that because Dad is teaching me how to be be be a big man he goes in the room and he goes uh Hey blushy you know why um why Dad I love you drive because he's teaching me to be a big human my wife what dude that's awesome I'm uh I'm excited for my when my kids are old enough that I could try to do that and I'm totally going to do a ton of them and yeah I'm thinking about the same thing too about children and like what it means to to like bring them in if if it's all at all possible but I do believe that what you said was true of it is mostly a lie that we tell ourselves of why we are grinding it ain't for them it's so we could feel [ __ ] dope and Powerful exactly by the way I didn't answer your question fully which is if they're interested you a lot of people don't want to do it because they're like oh working with family is messy working with friends is messy um I learned one thing on this podcast episode some I don't know one of the first 20 episodes with Mike Brown he said uh I asked him about he brought his brother is into his business and I was like was that a good idea bring your brother's in and he looked at me like I was it like I was asking him like are you sure you draw to drink water it's pretty wet he goes my view of life is you find the people you love and you do life with them and then that became like [ __ ] Central to my core over like in that Split Second I like changed as a human being I was like oh okay that made total sense to me and that's the answer right like find the people you love and then do life with them and I will hit up people and I'll like try to find an excuse to just do a project with them or do a trip with them or do a something with them like that has been so fruitful in one of my businesses we brought in you know I did a business with my wife we brought in my sister into a business I've done so many different I've done a business with my two best friends like that has become just an operating philosophy that that has served me very well and like yeah there are times where it doesn't work out well so what that's like everything there's no full proof strategy but the upside of finding people you love and doing life with them is so much higher than the downsides of when it doesn't work out uh in my opinion but um right and that's how I feel about this podcast by the way like you know when we met I always loved hanging out with you it's like Sam's this crazy combination of really smart but smart about things that nobody else I know is smart about those things like he knows about this [ __ ] family apron rental business you know like you just have a trillion of these things and you're also really fun and funny which is super like which I learn to appreciate was very rare in people like the more kind of successful you get the more serious people get whereas you were one of these people or the more successful you got the sillier you got and I was like dude I just want to have this guy in my life somehow right like how I don't know what the excuse he moved away but I'm glad this podcast became like an excuse to to to do that well I'm glad too and by the way to the people listening that [ __ ] takes work like I particularly like like you and I uh like like we give and take uh to make each other happy but I would imagine it's the same thing with children in business where it's like I know this is the wrong thing that we should be doing but I got to let the kid like [ __ ] up you know what I mean and I think that's really hard to do dude there was a great quote I don't know if I'm allowed to quote this I think I am uh when I went to that event for uh the tiny event in Canada Chris Andrew Wilkinson and his partner Chris they they on Tiny the hold C the hold Co has like 40 companies inside they're doing a session about hold Coes and somebody asked them they were like hey I'm I'm setting up my hold Co I'm in you're one and I just want to know like how much support do you guys have from the back office like do you centralize finances because I think that could be really good like cost savings plus easy way to have oversight and do centralize legal like what do you all what do you what do you guys centralize to to get the most Synergy and um their answer is Chris was like basic up till now we've done no we we centralize almost nothing and he goes for two reasons number one so he had he had a a smart reason and then he had a great quote his smart reason was he goes whenever we owned the financials it felt good because we felt in control the problem was we were in control the CEO looked at the numbers I was like those are your numbers those aren't my numbers I don't own that I don't know I don't know what that Target is I don't know what those numbers are I'm on the receiving end of these numbers and um oh that that's a good point um the second thing that Cody said he goes um we wanted all of our companies to be able to run without us and the only way to do that was to just completely you know not completely neglect but like to to neglect them to not offer support and services and he goes the children of deadbeat dads grow up tough and independent it's like a groan in the audience but I was like I like that I like that a lot he's like he's like it's true like you know like it's the the kids that grow up in know like a harder environment that are tough and independent the refugee the refugee team of the Olympics exactly and I thought that was such a good quote and a great answer he he said he goes by the way now that might not be the answer now we might end up centralizing more as we're now a public company and all this other there's other reasons to do it now but what got us here and what worked for us was that all right that's the p [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
here's the headline millionaire working at McDonald's and actually it's actually much more interesting than [Music] that this is the story of a guy named Scott meetup.com is probably the most popular thing that he made Meetup is a really cool sign I used it when I moved to San Francisco joined a bunch of groups met a bunch of people it's basically a way to go from the internet to actually meeting people in real life and so I knew about Meetup I had even known about Scott but what I didn't know is the story that Scott after he had sold his first company actually went and worked at McDonald's just to kind of reset and he did that for a while and now he was going viral because he's kind of doing it again he didn't tell anybody but people saw him update his LinkedIn and it said Amazon associate or like Warehouse associate or something basically he's back at a Amazon warehouse now being a pick Packer kind of minimum W's job again and people are like dude this is not the first time he's done this he did this with McDonald's like you know 20 years ago and I found this fascinating and I went down to Scott rabbit hole and I want to talk to you about it you have some good stuff there too right is that how it caught your eye Yeah so basically he grew up uh I think in Iowa or Idaho somewhere in the Midwest and he grew up there and he saw that Mark and Dron releases Netscape and he was like this is amazing and so he's like I'm gonna get in the internet and so in the mid90s he starts I believe like one of the world's first online Internet agencies I think it was an advertising agency something like that he sells it for around $15 million uh which is something like 30 million bucks in today's money and he sells it and after he sells it he was like I've been working for six or seven years at this internet startup and I work in marketing but I'm only around like bankers and lawyers and other like yepy people that's horrible for my position as a marketer but also like I feel so out of touch with the people here let's use his words so he wrote this on his site you found it back in the internet AR which I thought is great so it says why I got a job at McDonald's I spend a lot of time with bankers lawyers internet Freaks and corporate wonks and other people living strange lives as a good marketing guy that's a bad thing and as a practicing anti-consumerist that's a bad thing so I got a job at McDonald's to help get back in touch with the real world also after six grueling years of the internet Whirlwind I wanted to experience a profitable well-oiled multi-billion dollar machine and I deserved a break today and then he goes and works at McDonald's and he even talks about he shows his application he goes I just walked in off the street it was at like Fifth and Broadway in New York City I walked off uh off the street and he's like the manager was like so are you used to like working with teams or something like that and he and Scott was like in his blog post he goes yeah I was honest I said yes I am used to that yeah he goes I was truthful in my interview he asked if I can handle a fastpac intense environment I said yes he looked at my resume and asked about my current part-time job as chairman of eye traffic I said it's an internet thing he said okay and then asked me for for my waist size for the pants and he works there for like six months and he has this amazing blog post about everything that he's learned by the way I don't think he worked there for six months I think it was like more more like three or four weeks something like that but he said 575 ain't much so he was making 575 an hour times 40 hours a week times 52 weeks a year that's $1,960 pre-tax he goes some people said it was disrespectful to me to take a job at McDonald's I didn't need the money they thought I was making fun of people that worked there the opposite is true I gained a bucket of respect people that bust their butt for such low pay it's one thing to scan past like statistics you see about how many people make $112,000 a year read about them in the paper it's another thing to sit back there in a fry heaving McNugget wielding six-hour shift and go home smelling like fries and McNuggets and realize you only made about $30 this day it's an eye opener interpret that as you see fit and then what happens is while he's working at McDonald's cranes which is a a business publication they want to do a story on Scott about like CEOs in post-acquisition life and he's like yeah come and uh see what I'm up to now and they used this photo of him working at McDonald's where his McDonald's uniform and it's just the greatest photo I've ever seen and if you scroll through this old blog post we'll link it in YouTube you can see some of these pictures of him working it looks like it looks pretty wild well they they spun it like he was struggling right it's like dethroned CEOs is the title and they're like how are they handling the dot crash this this do CEO is backward working at a McDonald's it's like wait that's not what it's not even what happened at all but okay sure now fast forward to today but by the way he made $15 million I think in that sale so he sold his Agency for about 15 million bucks who knows stock cash who knows if these is like but ballpark right let's take it directional and then he goes from there to working at a McDonald's um you know just to kind of like re acclimate with the real world which I thought was was really good and fast forward to today so in 18 or 19 something like that he sells me . to we work the price was rumored to be 200 million but who knows it's enough that he doesn't have to go and work some place like this turns out he has a job at at an Amazon fulfillment center and he doesn't make a big ordeal out of this he doesn't like tell people about this he just puts it on his LinkedIn someone finds it and shares it so he ends up and uh does a podcast where he talks about the story of of of why he's at Amazon it's the same type of thing where he's like uh I just like felt out of touch with average people and I wanted to I wanted to feel that again and he doesn't exactly say this but he says something like the interviewer was asking him about his experience there and he's like uh the interview was like isn't that that place where like they just had a big issue with uh them the workers in the warehouse wanting to unionize and he's like look I don't want to talk too much about that but yeah that's where it was and I think it's a good idea and he sort of insinuates that that he was part of it that he was part of it and he was kind of like whispering in people's ears and he doesn't explicitly say that but the language that he uses where he's like I don't really want to talk about it but yeah like I was there I saw it all happening and he was like you know it's funny I'm like an entrepreneur and I'm usually the guy who you'd un unionize against but I thought it was a good idea to have a union and it's it's as if that he's like the one riling people up and so this guy in a weird way he's like a little for scump character like he's like experiencing all these things in the background and he's like potentially a pivotal part of the story but he doesn't really talk about it it reminds me of you know like movies and there a f up analogy but it's like movies where it's like the the genius nerd gets sent to prison but then he like does you know then he's like the master then he like brings a new angle and sort of rallies the the crew inside the prison a different way right or like we had scy on the podcast and he was talking about the same thing he said he went to prison and he started the Bitcoin club like the crypto club and he started all these like learning clubs for technology inside the prison but then they also taught him a bunch of things it was like meeting of the of the world that's what this reminds me of this I sort of going into the Fulfillment center and and like stirring up the union the union efforts I know I have a friend of a friend who was a banker he was like the really successful Wall Street guy and he retired but he got bored and so he was like dude I'm G to drive for Uber so he starts driving for Uber and he ends up after doing that for a little while he starts a private driving business where he's like a broker so for example when I go to the airport I I do use a private driver but it's only like $30 more than an Uber uh it's not like much more expensive but it feels a little bit nicer he started one of these and he ended up being a broker for it and he is now making like a million dollars a year being a broker for some of these drivers when you want uh a car and it's kind of a similar thing would you ever if you had like a break in your career would you ever want to do one of these kind of blue collar jobs yeah dude when I saw this I was inspired on three fronts the first this is a guy who plays his own game and if you know anything about me you know that is what I respect the most people who have their own View point they bring their own frame to the game and they say this is how I want to use my time in life and this is what I think is right they don't really follow the hurt right like how many Founders who sell their company then become a VC then go from VC oh back to being a founder and advisor and go on podcast by the way I did all this after I sold my company too right I sold my company started investing started a podcast started doing the normal path and so when I see people who just thought from first principles well what they cared about in life and decided what they wanted to do and did it even though it sounded weird or unconventional highest level of respect for me um so that's the first thing inspired by that second inspired by the th the the idea of basically just getting out of your bubble um I do this in a in a different way not usually by a job but like you know you told me about that conference Farm con which is a conference for farmers and I went there that was the only te that was the only conference I went to I didn't go to any Tech conference any investing conference I went to a farming conference because I knew it would put me completely out of my bubble exposed to a whole bunch of different people with different thoughts and philosophies and different views about the world right now and I knew I would get new ideas and sure enough a business came out of that we ended up launching a business um the milk Road out of that and so U There Was You know I I'm I'm a big fan of that I'm inspired by that the only thing I would do differently is I wouldn't necessarily just copy what this guy did and just go get a blue color job necessarily like it's the lesson for me is think for myself what's my version of this that's feel that's more real to me right uh that that I actually do feel compelled to do that I would feel excited to do and go do it maybe it would be driving Uber maybe it would be going and working at a warehouse maybe it' be something different I'm not sure but this this really like sparked something in me to to take my to use my time to go do something like that I completely agree by the way you know one version of this for me it's either teaching at a school like go to be a second grade teacher for like a year or Gordon Bombay and just go coach a team and go go do my version of The Mighty Ducks I I've actually been itching to do this to go and just coach like a seventh grade boys basketball team or something I did this for a while I I coached at a uh it was actually like a school for autistic and Asbergers kids and I I coached their basketball team and it was like one of the best experiences of my life just doing that on the side for fun um and I think I might go back and try to do something like that that's I think that would be my version of this all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show dude a few weeks ago I emailed this High School asking if they need like an assistant uh track and field coach right and I got and I was so pumped up about it I'm like this is so filling this is awesome the best is when they're like you're not qualified for that well yeah I honestly was a little nervous about that but I get like the hours and like what they what they demand uh of me and I'm like that's a lot of work that's a huge commitment so like my inspiration like very quickly like lowered down so I got to figure out if I'm gonna do it um can we can we finish Scott because there's more his story that I think is pretty interesting so he's born in a big family and um like you said sort of middle of the country I think Illinois or something and uh we just named three different ey states by the way Illinois Idaho sorry sorry I'm from there we offended all of them by by grouping them all together all right so he's the youngest to five his siblings are like 20 years older than him just kind of the way their family Dynamics worked and so he's the youngest by like 15 to 20 years and um he starts his first business when he's nine do you know what it's called no what Scott slave service oh which a nine-year-old can get away with because he's basically saying it's free labor for for SI for my siblings and so he's like hey whatever whatever tasks you got I'm yours I will do whatever whatever task you have that but he gets the entrepreneurial bug there starts learning to code his first job out of college is actually at Sony and he tells Sony he's like hey this is like 94 95 he's like the internet's going to be a thing and they're like okay kid like whatever you say he's like no no no you should have like a website and they're like all right well if you want to build one go you know have at it so he he ends up building the first website for like you know sunny.com and he realizes pretty quickly he's like okay this ain't it he also in 93 had started one of the first internet shows one of the first podcasts essentially he started his own radio show on the internet um which is called advertorial infotainment and he was basically questioning consumer culture so he's he considers himself sort of a anti-consumerist in many ways so he he does that then he does the first thing which was that that business we called it traffic which was a a media buying agency and he was joking around like at the time there was really no media to buy on the internet yet but he knew people are going to want to advertise on the internet this will make websites have a business model so let's do this he sells that thing for 15 million which by the way that doesn't I mean it's so obvious now yes he's right but that's pretty wild to like be that bold in 94 95 to make some of these predictions he was he nailed them he was 100% right and he knew that because when he was a teen and again he's 20 years younger than all his siblings he's got a lot of Al loone time and he's basically spending it you know programming just for fun and he's just becomes convinced that like computers and the internet like this is where it's at then he does the McDonald's thing and by the way do we want to read a few of his like blog post takeaways from his McDonald's thing I thought this was really good why did and why I don't you know we we had to use web archive to find his this post he took it down I wish he didn't it's fantastic well we we still got it we'll show some of the pictures on here he's got like a picture of like his burn from the F the fry machine and stuff like that on his arm but like here's one of them so he goes Nobody number four uh nobody thanked me I worked hard I got paid peanuts I even ate McDonald's during my food break deducted from my pay it was intense the cast register was complex the people want their food now the lines get deep the McFlurry must be made just right I was trying hard I was doing an okay job now I've been a leader and a manager for most my life I've had plenty of crap jobs but I've been the boss for the past few years and I Faithfully read Fast Company magazine and my Harvard Business review and I've read that countless times that the value of a leader or manager showing appreciation for people's effort however my instinct has been often that showing appreciation really isn't too necessary or good for people they just take pride in a job well done and they can read my mind and see the appreciation well from day one at McDonald's I was yearning for someone just to say thanks or you're even doing okay would have been sufficient but no neither management experience nor reading about management teaches this lesson in the same way as feeling it being an underappreciated employee so I read that uh a few hours ago when I was getting ready and I went and messaged a bunch of employees and I said you're doing great you're doing great you're doing okay because it this is everyone should go and read this post it is this is awesome this is a very inspiring thing yeah he talks about the dollar menu and a bunch of things okay so he does that by the way if you look on this p AG he left his phone number in the photo of the application I text I texted him uh I'm going to try well I'll try to get him on yeah I would love that Scott come on that'd be amazing so then he has this next period where he's like he's got 30 ideas he's like what do I want to do next he's got 30 ideas and have you read the story about kind of how he narrowed that down to two was it the SE September 11th story yes exactly so he lives a few miles away from the Twin Towers so September 11th happens he sees the the planes hitting the building and I think the story was like he was kind of on the rooftop of his building or he's outside of his building and it was the first time he had ever met any of his neighbors like he'd been living there for a while he just didn't know anyone and this now that they were all outside and they're seeing this crazy thing they're all talking they're meeting and he was like kind of struck by man I really live a pretty like solo life and I'm just on the internet and he had had a couple of other experiences that that kind of triggered him in that so there's the September 11th thing a week later he reads this book called bowling alone and I guess this book has big impact on him because he then ends up giving this to every Meetup employee and bowling alone was just basically a book about statistics he's honest he's like I didn't even read the whole thing but he's like the beginning of the book makes a very clear point that more and more we're doing less things with other people which is C which the less interaction you have with strangers causes you to trust strangers less which then causes you to spend less time with them and it's just ter cycle that we go into and he's like then he notices in his own life he's a big fan of this band a Luna and he goes to a bunch of their shows and they're a small band and so he ends up he's like dude I'm in like Conference Centers in a hotel Ballroom B and he's like I'm listening to the band play and he's like you know I used to just go alone I would you know you know kind of dance or sing alone I'd go home alone he's like but soon enough you know I started to see some other faces there that were the other regulars like there weren't many of us who were big fans of this band but he's like we still didn't talk to each other that much because it wasn't clear that it was okay to go talk to each other so that's where he decides he Narrows down his list of ideas from 30 to two one of them is Meetup where he's like well what if we made it where the internet could help people meet up in real life and we could solve this bowling alone problem where people interact more with strangers which increases their trust in strangers which increases the amount of time they're willing to talk to other people and make it okay to just have these real life interactions even with the internet um the second one which he doesn't talk about too much is something called photo log did you see this it's like a uh a flicker like service yeah he was early man he was too early he was super early I think he sold it for like 90 million bucks or something so he did well with it um it was like the biggest social network in certain countries around the world but then flicker came out flicker was growing faster and then then the next wave of social networks came out I saw him describe it as as Instagram before Instagram but I didn't know that it was that financially successful that's amazing yeah so he did really well with that as well and so he um you know he sells that company does he start Meetup and photo log at the same time that's a good question I'm not sure if it was the exact same time I know there were yeah somewhat intandem uh they were they were sort of like you know either same time or very close to each other and so he does Meetup Meetup starts growing and then he makes a pretty controversial move which is he decides not to at not to make Meetup business model just ads he's like no I'm GNA charge people for the service which at the time was like very anti again he goes counter to the main mainstream of where what everybody else was doing with their websites at the time and traffic drops off like 95% but he's like he stays with it he's like I believe that this is the sustainable path for this he's like the people who are organizing these meetups they should pay a fee because they're the ones kind of Hosting getting the value it will keep the quality bar high so let's do that and he survives the big 90% drop in usage and meup becomes a profitable sustainable business and it goes on for a long time until they sell for to wew work for I don't know 150 to 200 million bucks by the way I have a friend uh Greg who used to work at he also got acquired by weor and so I texted Greg this morning and I was like Greg do you got any stories about this guy Scott he goes I got one so he goes uh I get to wework and Scott tells me hey meet me at 555 Broadway at 6 pm and then I go okay he text me right before he goes by the way um clear your calendar for the night okay I don't know what's going to happen here but like all right I'm interested I'm game so he shows up and there's just white van with five other people in it he's like all right I'm gonna die I don't know what's happening tonight but I guess tonight's tonight I die and um Scott walks in tells the driver let's go and then he says um hey you're you're new here and I wna um do something I do with everybody who's new which is we're going to go crash five or six meetups tonight and you're going to get to actually like go experience them firsthand first day um let's go and so he was just taking six kind of new people in the company to go and they crash like a Harry Potter meet up and then like a women with diabetes meet up and they went to six different meetups that night and they stayed out all night basically at this thing and Greg was like dude I'll never forget that such a cool founder move to do that and to kind of stay in the community stay like amongst the the users and the people and to make that part of the culture for new people that are in the company how awesome is that dude this guy's amazing I love him so good right yeah and that he's been in the game for so long and that he's still he's not like a high and mighty executive you know what I mean like he still kind of seems like he seems like he's in it well and then it takes another twist Meetup then gets carved out of we work and so this brings up this connects two other data points of our podcast so on the episode with Jeremy gfin he talked about one of his biggest like underrated opportunities right now is messy carve outs what he meant was that sometimes there's companies an acquisition happens and usually like either you know a year later or so the company realizes that hey of all the assets they didn't really want one of the assets or that the company that acquires it starts to go south and this good company they bought is embedded inside of a bad company and this is exactly what happened with Meetup so they buy we work buys Meetup for I don't know1 150 $200 million but then Meetup itself or sorry wework itself becomes you know a dumpster fire but Meetup was still a good asset inside of this dumpster fire and so here comes a guest of the pod Kevin Ryan who's been on the podcast came in and actually bought meet up for peanuts out of that sale I remember uh looking I mean I I didn't have like the finances at the time to be able to afford it but someone was like hey do you want to get it on this and uh I was like yeah this is like super interest on the podcast I think you shared the numbers right yeah yeah yeah yeah and and I didn't think that it was gonna be Kevin Ryan it was a bunch of like you know I'm I'm not even in the ballpark to be able to afford whatever it was but I was like you know maybe I could throw in just a small amount of money to like a group of people who are trying to buy it and I thought it was very interesting and then lo and behold the man Kevin Ryan comes in and and if he comes in like to me he's a really good signal something is interesting here so he bought it and then they put in a CEO they turned it around it's like profitable and they just did a great job with it they they got a great it turned out to be a great investment for them is it a big business or is it just like a a pretty good business that's just not automated but like it just we'll see what happens you know it'll 15% a year maybe yeah so I mean it's all relative right so it's a it's a better business than any business I've ever built however in the grand scheme of things I know what I know what question you're asking which is like is this some sort of rocket ship type of crazy billion dollar business I don't know I don't think so it looks like it's a flow and steady flow and steady profitable cash flowing business that's good for Humanity so in that sense it's an awesome business yeah I think this guy's the man I think he's absolutely awesome uh you should listen to the podcast uh it's called uh internet Misfits I think that he was on and he's the definition of an Internet Misfit and he talks a little bit about his time at Amazon it he's a cool guy this guy's really fascinating he's a fascinating dude I and I always I've recognized this guy forever you know when you and I were just getting going on the internet that was when Meetup was in it's tday and I would go to so many meetups I actually started my event hustle con because of meetup.com I created a small Meetup event on meetup.com I got a lot of free users that way that's how I built my email list uh I love meetup.com I like this guy Scott we got to we got to have them uh on board yeah by the way internet Misfits that's a great podcast name if if we didn't have such a cringe name that could have been ours that would have been a great great name for us let me uh can I tell you about a different story yeah sort of actually similar to Scott going to McDonald's so have you ever heard of uh you're weird with your pop culture I don't know what you do and do not know because you don't know many things about pop culture have you ever heard of Rosie the river no so basically in the 194 in the early 19 40s uh America goes to war all the men between like you know 18 and 35 go off and serve the war so there's this uh huge uh need for manufacturers or workers in manufacturing plants to go and create like B uh b7s like these bombers or whatever we're making uh not only just what we were making before but now we have to make all these weapons and all these supplies uh they needed to get young women which who never worked before to come and work in factories and they needed to make it look cool and so they had these ads like if you can work an electric mixer you can work uh a drill and so they would like do all these like things to get young women to entice them to come to the workforce and then Westinghouse which at the time was like a huge manufacturing company they created this campaign called Rose the name of the character was Rosie the Riveter and the ad says yes we can and it was like uh yes young women you got to come and do this you owe it to your country and you're a strong young woman you should come and do this and so at the time before the War I think something like like 2 million women worked after that campaign went live it was something like 20 million young women went and got jobs and so it was very like a women empowerment type of thing but also like push America forward and so it was incredibly effective and by the way you should see the ads in the 1950s it's called back to normaly and it was like what does Rosie do now that the war is over and it's very much like we're g to sell you this refrigerator and there's all these ads like what should Rosie do with strawberries on a summer day and it's like make a make a strawberry shortcake so it's like pretty crazy how like so who's so who was paying for these ads is this the government or the first part maybe think it's the manufacturing companies but then why would they pay for Rosie back to the kitchen I don't understand that part well because uh I mean obviously like sexism but like when the when when the originally it was westing house and a bunch of other manufacturers did these campaigns to to to convince women to come work for them but then also the government uh you know it's propaganda is what it is but it's like good propaga where they would do this stuff it's like you know we all have to do this together and so the government did it as well as private companies and so the company that did Rosie the river was uh it's called westing house it was a it was a large manufacturer uh Rosie The River by the way is one of the most recognized images uh in American history and it's in the smithonian it's like a big deal because it was like a turning point for American feminism things like this uh but also like the war um but uh yeah you should see the ads in the 50s when they're like all right the men are back back to normaly that was the campaign was back to normaly but the reason I'm saying this is uh back then in the 40s and 50s you know we were kind of booming with Manufacturing in fact have you heard of the Rust Belt have you heard that phrase the Rust Belt I have heard that one that refers to where I'm from Missouri uh places like St Louis Cleveland Chicago things like that before it was called the Rust Belt in the 50s and 60s it was called the steel belt because that's where we manufactured everything uh and then the name changed to the Rust Belt meaning all these old rusty factories that no one uses anymore and so that's actually uh how the name came to be now the where I'm getting with all of this there's this company that is called uh blue Forge they created this ad that is the best ad that I've seen in years [Music] thank you the most she can ask for is 2 million you have a Char okay ring me away what doesn't kill you makes you stronger coins thank youum I'm sorry I'm sorry no no no no I'm moving my car right nowly apologize yes we for taking your feedback very [Music] [Music] seriously hey what do you do here [Music] get a gig that's built to last and the and so the ad is basically all about this gig economy and how it like crushes your soul because when Rosie the Riveter they so they they call them Rosie the riveters that's like the women who are working in these factories they interviewed a bunch of them when they were older and they were like you know we built this B this B17 which is a bomber and we saw it roll off the the manufacturing line and we were we had so much pride you know we were helping America but also we were working together to achiev this task we felt amazing about ourselves now this ad basically shows like when you're driving Uber and things like that you feel shitty you have people complaining you're not working towards a common goal and so this company blue Forge it was put together uh I think in uh I believe the Navy uh funded it and what they're trying to do is to convince Young Americans to go back to manufacturing jobs or uh they don't mean to do this but it sort of does it go back to trade jobs so basically things that where you work with your hand to rebuild Manufacturing in America and I saw this ad and I did a little bit of research on what's going on with like the reindustrialization of of America it's incredibly fascinating this ad is so good and it's trying to make these manufacturing jobs which don't even exist that much right now but if they do exist they're like unsexy as [ __ ] like they're not cool and what this company is doing is they are trying to make it look cool and they are totally succeeding and you're seeing this a little bit with um uh Andre you know Andre yeah so Palmer luy's uh defense business in uh Orange County where it's cool again to work in factories it's cool again to make stuff and I 100% buy into this premise and I think it is so great and I was thinking about like different ideas and things like that uh but a really simple one if you refer someone to some of these jobs you can earn up to $500 and so it's actually like a pretty interesting opportunity if you just Google like trade jobs or manufacturing jobs you go to the websites they kind of look silly uh they're not like that enticing there's no like sex appeal which inherently like these jobs I think are quite romantic like they are it is really cool you can make them seem and and appear really cool because I think they actually are and a lot of them will pay $30 $40 an hour depending on on what it is particularly the trades which are incredibly popular right now with j on Tik Tok but I just thought this ad was so awesome yeah it's an amazing ad it just shows kind of like do you want to spend your whole life running around doing tasks for other PE people basically being a you know a delivery person or and then the doors open and the manufacturing is happening and it's like you could or you could step into here and really build something and uh it's a really really well done ad yeah it's it's badass and I think originally so that company blue Forge I think they're built around the submarine industry apparently they couldn't get enough people to work on submarines and so they won these huge contracts to help them get more submarine workers and that's something I never even would have thought exists right but it does yeah really cool I hope this happens I hope America shifts back to much more of a we build things here culture which I think they're trying to do you know uh you know Tesla SpaceX uh being based here I think is really awesome Ander I think that then there the chips act which is trying to build a giant chip factory like the you know instead of being reliant on Taiwan so there's there's an effort to try to do kind of modern manufacturing here I really want to do a episode where we go down to what's it called like El Segundo or whatever there's 10 interesting companies all on this like one block our buddy John kugan did an amazing video uh worth watching 17 minutes and it's basically he goes to this area of El Segunda where he's like you got SpaceX radiant nuclear vaa AB Space Systems there's like a whole bunch of companies like all in this one area and he went and he hung out with them he took a camera and a crew out there um it's worth checking out it's I think pretty inspiring and it's you know there there are these hot beds right there's like AI hot beds there's crypto hot beds and then it's like where is the kind of like hard tech hot bed and it seems like this is the answer and if you're if you're interested in that or you're doing that or you just want to just go feel that energy I think it's cool to watch the videos or go visit a place like this and it is happening by the way like uh the T Toyota Tundra Tundras are made in Texas and so if you're in Texas and you see a tundra a lot of them have a made in Texas sign and also when I lived in Nashville Tennessee I lived like 10 miles from the Nissan plant and I remember thinking like I used to think like made in America I had to get a Ford it's like this Nissan is just as made in America as anything else and so like it's definitely happening uh but I think that there's like an there's an interesting group of people who are making it seem very sexy and I dig that you want to do one more thing uh yeah I got one related one so there's a thing that Elon um talks about that I think more people should hear um have you heard Elon talk about his problem solving method his five-step problem solving method no but is like step four like have kids or something he said he's got 12 kids by the way which is impressive so he talks about the I think I don't know the last one was Lex freed been talking about it but he's he's said this many times over the years which is a good signal because it's kind of like more fundamental to his philosophy they been talking about it for a while and Lex asked him he goes how do you engineer great things right you're building rockets that can land on themselves you're building the best electric cars on the planet you just did the neuralink chip in the guy's brain and now the guy's like playing civilization using his brain to control the computer game like what is your is there some like General process you do that that works this and Elon said the following five steps he goes step one question the requirements and and all of this was born out of Pain by the way of not doing this he goes so you know question the requirements means um do we need to do this at all if we need to do this how exactly do we need to do this like before you go in and just build a solution to the first prompt that people have of like oh we need X we need to do y right he instead of just immediately jumping to it and saying I can build it I could do it it's you first really drill down and you try to make the requirements as true and simple as possible so you try to figure out what is actually needed what are the what are the requirements why is that the requirement all that stuff so that's the step one question of the requirements step two is basically uh like delete and so he's like U he goes the biggest mistake that smart people make is optimizing something that shouldn't have existed in the first place and I thought this was the the best point that he made in this whole thing he goes in my companies we will try to if it's a if it's a machine we'll try to delete a part Can it can we do without this part all together rather than trying to make that that part work or lower the cost of the part can we get rid of the part and will the thing still work um if it's a process inside your company instead of trying to optimize the process what happens if you deleted the process or there's a role in the company could you delete the role and what he says is that um just like the government always adds new rules and regulations and that's why the tax code book is this thick um it actually is because we add far more than we ever subtract and this happens in big companies too and every big company you add people and processes and more requirements um to every single thing very rarely is there any like trash cleaning function that gets rid of the bottom 20% we're we're willing to add 20% we're very rarely getting willing to get rid of 20% so he talks about how when you remove he goes he goes this is a lyic system override he goes because our brains are wired so that we are kind of Hoarders by by Nature we're afraid to get rid of something because we're worried something bad will happen and then if you ever get rid of something and one time out of 10 you really needed it and it turns out that removing was a bad thing when we add it back our brain basically inflames right away and we're like oh my God see and we overcorrect and then the next time we're way more hesitant to get rid of something just because we all remember that one time that we got rid of that thing and we ended up needing it and you know I'm by the way I'm going on a family vacation my wife is like literally like I told her I was like I think you're trying to take our house and just bring it with us on vacation like this is not how packing is supposed to go and she's like like well we might need this one thing or we can't get rid of that and I'm like I'm watching my wife pack I'm listening to this Elon thing and I'm like this is true not just in business but in life which is that uh we will always remember the one thing that we we did we decided to remove that we needed even though nine out of tenen times you could have got away with it dude but I think he removes too much stuff like I have a Tesla sometimes you don't even need to like switch into reverse like it automatically does that but and you also don't have any buttons you know it's just a screen I want the damn button I don't want the damn stream you know what I mean he removes a lot of stuff I mean look at the iPhone right most successful product of all time when they came out and they remove the keyboard people were freaking out then they removed the home button I remember being like you we got rid of the home button are you nuts like this is crazy and they got rid of the home button then they got rid of the port then they got rid of this right they keep the best companies in the world actually do this the uh the thing he says he goes we measure basically if we are not adding back at least 10% of the time the thing that we removed either a process in the company a role in the company or a part of the of the product a feature of the product if we're not adding back at least 10% of the time that means we have not been removing enough and so that's his Benchmark and it goes that is the only like we we set that as a Target in the same way that when you set goals and you're any good company if you set goals you do not want to hit the goals 100% of the time because that means you were being way too cautious with your goals you were not being ambitious enough nor do you want to hit your goals 0% of the time because that means you were being way to too unrealistic about your goals and so most people like at Amazon they were saying when we worked there they were like you want to hit 70% of your goals 7% of your goals means you're stretching enough but you're also not over stretching and being unrealistic about what you can achieve and building a culture of missing missing uh disappointing expectations and so Elon talks about that as like step two is to remove the thing you look like you had a reaction to that I love it it's hard to do like I not only do I know people react negatively to that at like any company been at because I've done the same thing I react sometimes negatively of like well it's it's working why break it and remove it you know what I mean I agree fundamentally with it it's very challenging to to to do simple but hard exactly um there's other steps in the process so he's talks about um you know then you want to simplify then you want to um you know automate uh automate is kind of the last step basically of the five that he talks about he's like you know I can't tell you how many times I've done this backwards you know I start off trying to automate a process and then I try to you know speed it up then I try to simplify it and then I try to then he's like basically at the end I realized I just needed to remove it in the first place it wasn't even the right thing I qu then I finally question the requirement uh last he's like I got tired of doing that wrong so many times that I made this as my my process so that I could I make sure I don't I don't fall into that trap again and there's a famous story of the Tesla manufacturing plant where he tried to create basically a robo Factory right off the jum he's like oh why do we need to do all this we'll just automate the whole thing and they basically almost killed the company by trying to overdo the automation at the start rather than doing that at the end of the process dude that's pretty fascinating I'm not a fan of elon's Personality I'm a huge fan of his work I I like to read these old books uh like particularly about the Gilded Age and all these industrialists and I'm reading one about Andrew Carnegie who's one of my favorite guys to read about and he was a really big deal because back then no business people would ever talk publicly or they would write publicly about this and he wrote a book and it was considered groundbreaking that one of these rich guys actually shared ideas it's compared to now it's the barrier to entry is so low for sharing ideas it is pretty awesome that we get to like learn and get all these good insights to people who are doing amazing and big things totally this happens right now in sports by the way like the Olympics is going on and you see um there's like the Netflix documentary about the sprinters right but there's also one about quarterbacks and receivers and you get to see how these people live how they prepare how they recover right I'm doing a an episode of a series of this my new email series called Good Friday we just did one together but the next one that's coming out or or in a couple weeks is with Mike Manas he's LeBron's trainer of 20 years no way he met LeBron when LeBron James was 19 years old he's been his trainer now LeBron's 39 years old and he's he's had the best longevity of any basketball player really ever like playing at a peak level for 20 straight years dud longevity physically and emotionally I'm shocked that guy has not screwed up well yeah exactly I mean he's been a model citizen right like since and he's like in many ways a child star right a child you know how screwed up most child actors are or child stars are this guy was on the cover of Sports Illustrated like 15 or 16 years old and it just said the chosen one and somehow did not get all screwed up from that right has like you know great kids great wife you know like has a great life uh never been in trouble with the law none of that stuff so really incredible and one of the things he talks about is like or in doing the series I was like man I'm getting access to information that 30 years ago I feel like people just didn't have access to this right you didn't know what the guys did for their pregame nutrition and for their postgame recovery and how they train but now it's filmed now it's documented now the skills trainers have their own Instagram and so if you're a young basketball player the blueprint is there the access to information is there now uh because of the way that everything is is you is documented on social media or in interviews where you now have access to information like you would have never had before which by the way if you watch the Olympics particularly running is the easiest one because a very like clear standard where you like I just look at the data and I could see we're going faster uh when I was like 16 like they would just tell you like eat loads of pasta the night before you don't need to do that unless you're like unless you're unless you're intend to burn 2,000 calories like you don't need that many carbs you know but there's like all these little things like well this one guy said that he would eat pasta like before so that's just what do and like you just hear these like rumors like well this this one guy said one time in the famous quote like don't have sex or don't masturbate like a week before like a big event so therefore you have to do that have you heard that by the way like that's like a thing of course yeah still a thing and fighting it's still a thing it's still hugely a thing but like by the way there's no evidence that that like does anything uh but it's like you hear these things like he's like well I heard this I heard Muhammad Ali did this one time so I have to do it and and that's how it was up up until like you looked into that you into the research you wanted to see like for podcasting what you're supposed to do you know chat jbt makes it easy all right I think we're I think that's the signal we're reaching that time we're turning into eighth grade boys all right that's the pot [Music]

started an e-commerce company I wanted to be the williamsa pet supplies I put a million bucks of my own money in I sold it for like a million and a half so I made some money not a lot um I invested or I started another e-commerce company I started a travel site sold that for a little bit of money I started coming a red envelope which went public on the NASDAQ in 2002 and because I was young and dumb I kept investing and then I got in a war with the board and I did a proxy fight and I took over the board and put more of my money in and then 2008 came and there's a lot Shan strike and a software malfunction at the warehouse where we sent 10,000 gifts to the wrong addresses over the holidays and then a Wells Fargo analyst who was like 14 decided the credit crisis was coming and pulled our line and my stock went from seven bucks a share to zero in about 11 days and went the company had declared chapter 11 and I lost you know I lost pretty much everything do you remember how much money uh when you felt that Tipping Point where you did feel financially secure not like bulletproof where nothing will ever will happen but do you remember the inflection point where you're like okay this feels different than I've felt on on the climb I still don't I still haven't hit that point I'm still very anxious about money you know I had and I like to be very open about money because I think that not talking about money is basically a decorum that is promoted by the incumbents and the wealthy such that you don't understand how much money wealthy people have to keep poor and middle class people under the illusion that oh you you should be paying $45 5% taxes while I'm paying 177 and I think I think it's important to be very I think it's helpful to be transparent and I talk about how much money I've lost all my investments how much money I've gained my tax rates Etc you know I'm I'm still I'm not obsessed with money I think about it all the time I'm trying to get a lot more I'm I'm giving it away I five from five years ago I decided I was going to give away every dollar I made in current income um CU I wanted start catching up to the non- philanthropic Scott for the first 45 years of his life but I'm still trying to make a [ __ ] ton of money I still feel financially very insecure I still worry about a recession becoming a depression and I'm the guy who lost it again I've lost it all a couple times and so I don't feel I'm at that point where I don't have Financial anxiety I do sleep with one eye open you know I sold my first company for 28 million bucks by the time I split it with my ta and my partner in taxes I ended up with a few million dollars Red Envelope I got a few million there but I always seem to figure out a way to lose it but I was able to start again because I never had debt I've always lived below my means um but I would say the big win was probably selling L2 and I like thought oh wow I can buy a plane like that was not in my reach before um so that was kind of the big one that was like all the moons line what was the price what it sell for $200 or $300 million no it sold for 158 million but we'd only done one round of venture capital so the you know the common shareholders you know I was the largest Equity owner um so the top you know between me and the top six employees we probably own 70% of it um so that was that you know that was a lot of money for me I'd never had that kind of money before I'd always done well but I'd never had that kind of that kind of capital and then getting to invest that in the midst of a bull market we sold in 2017 I've made more money investing actually than I've made from my small from my businesses you know the ability to create an army of capital even if it's only 50 bucks a month or 100 bucks a month put it in a tax deferred or tax efficient vehicle diversify it and then let time take over against see above you don't know how fast time is going to go that's where I've built real wealth this doesn't this doesn't make sense for Shawn because sea is not worried about money at all he's got this thing that I like to call like good emotional health he's very emotionally healthy his parents did did him well and he's talked to me about this I sold my company two or 3 years ago and I made a a fair bit not you I'm I'm like I'm naked here what did you make yeah let's go let's go Sam you got to say he's hesitant he's hesitant because he's worri people listening okay go ahead uh at the end of the the process uh I walked away with about $20 million that and how old are you uh I was about 30 I was 31 or 32 so you should be extraordinary you should be unless you really screw up you should be much wealthier than I am by my age because to get that sort still I still feel shitty I feel the same like I still like I felt awesome for a minute and then I felt shitty where I was like oh like when I see these world events right now when I saw like whatever happens every six months I'm like the world's going to end and and I do uh like an I'm boring Sean makes fun of me I do 8020 index and bonds uh that that's the I only own those exactly what you should be doing right now I think so and I and then I own HubSpot stock still and then I own Airbnb stock that's basically basically my portfolio and um Sean makes fun of me he's like how are you feeling insecure I'm like dude I'm broken like I'm broken like I it doesn't matter how much therapy I go to I'm just I'm a broke when it comes to money I have a scarcity mindset and I'm broken yeah I'm the same way and when you talk about how you're worth you know 100 million plus and you don't feel feel secure and Sean said he's like what little [ __ ] like you know like you talk about masculinity man up you know what I mean like it's and I have the same thing I'm like I I can't I'm weak all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

my students I'll ask them how much money they expect to be making by the time they're 35 and about 90% of them expect to be in the top 1% which is $750,000 a year in America and then they'll talk about that like that's what I expect but I'll say what's most important to you in your life and moving forward and a lot of the time they say balance and I'm like so you expect to be in the top 1% by the time you're 35 but you also believe you're going to have balance in your life I mean I don't I've never seen that I don't you can have it all you just can't have it all at once and by the way that's that may not be the way to go you may sacrifice you may say I want to live a nice kind of balanced life I'm going to move to a suburb of St Louis coach little league work 40 hours a week be a good citizen find a good partner nothing wrong with that but the majority of the people I know the young people think they're going to be in the top 1% and also have balance in their life and I just think it's ridiculous I'm like okay the only way to get there to achieve that is if you have one thing and that's rich parents otherwise back to go all in on your career or scale back your expectations around your economics and your influence because it's a competitive market and one of the things people can control is how hard they work I don't think you want to I don't think you want to work so much that you sacrifice your health or your relationships there is going to be some trade-off with your relationships I didn't see my kids a lot when they were little I I was divorced I think it was a contributor to that I was always working in services companies and never saying no to any opportunity the CMO of Samsung can you be in Soul tomorrow for a board meeting sure I can you I mean I just said yes to everything to try and move the company forward but uh I I for a long period worked very very hard and sacrificed a lot and it it takes a toll and I did it such that I could have a lot more balance now but this notion the myth of balance get over it if you expect to be influential or economically secure you're not going to have a lot of balance for a long Peri per of time some people are such Geniuses that they can work a modest amount of time make a lot of money work out have a great relationship with their parents be fit donate time at the asbca and have a food blog assume you are not that person so just have a sober conversation and also have a sober conversation with your partner how much money do we expect to have who's responsible for making it what's your approach to spending where are we going to live you know the number one source of divorce is not um infidelity or lack of shared values it's usually got something to do with money and also 70% of divorce filings are filed by women who still and we don't like to say this because we like to pretend women have no agency and that they're just doughy little foes uh is the man loses a business becomes broke or has a mental breakdown when a man loses a status as a provider he's very inclined to be on the wrong end to divorce so I think a lot about young men I think a lot about financial sec security I think every man should start with the notion that he's going to be responsible for the economic well-being of his household and by the way sometimes that means getting out of the way and being more supportive of your partner who happens to be better at that money thing than you and that's a wonderful thing but start from a position of this is my responsibility um and make sure you're aligned with your partner around this stuff because the thing we don't talk about is that your kids are going to have higher blood pressure if you're economically strained kids in kids in low-income households have greater systolic resting blood pressure than kids in middle and upper inome homes you're much more likely to get divorced you're much more likely to have a stroke you're much more likely to be the victim or the perpetrator of domestic violence when you don't have money I mean America becomes more like itself every day and that is it's a loving generous place for people with money it's a rep pacious violent place for people who don't have money so all this that money doesn't buy you happiness oh my God is that a myth I'm not saying you need to be incredibly wealthy but middle- inome people are happier than poor people and wealthy people are happier than middle-income people that's the bad news the good news is that tops out you get diminishing returns and you have to be cognizant of when you do get to some level of Economic Security that's the means the ends is such that you can have an exhale release the anxiety that you feel and then use the opportunity to really spend a lot of time with your your loved ones and cement those relationships and the problem is you get on the hedonic treadmill and you become so absorbed in your own success and your professional identity and money and making more money that you never get to the ends you wake up a wealthy person or someone who's financially scar always thought about their economic well-being and you don't really have a great relationship with your kids or you never really leaned into your partnership and thought okay let's take time to really enjoy each other's company let's do nice things your parents die before you have a chance to really spend time with them as adults I think that happens to a lot of people they just get so caught up and I need the next promotion I need the next amount of money and but once I get here I have someone very close in my life it's a family member and I'm taking them to Africa and they're like making excuses but our kids in the choir they were making excuses I'm like you realize this is your last chance to go to Africa before you're dead right you're 50 years old when are you go when you're 70 but you got to get back to work an extra day I mean what are you thinking we're going to be dead soon and I I just think so many people don't realize how fast it's going to go by and never really never really like super not only super lean into the relationships but just allow themselves just to have a great time I'm going to Stage Coach this week I'm going to go to Country Music Festival I Can't Stand country but I'm going I'm going to buy a pair of boots I'm going I'm going to have a great time and I'm going to do an edible and I'm going to drink a ton and I'm going to have a rested adolescence with my friends and I'm going to look ridiculous and it's like yeah why why not why the not what am I going to do watch C-SPAN all weekend I mean anyway I I can't stand it when people who are blessed with being in this country have some level of Economic Security at people in their life that love them and they love and they don't like crazy lean into it because you guys are younger than I can it just goes so goddamn fast it's just crazy it is just crazy how fast it goes all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
in most areas of life you shouldn't be hoping for like the miraculous save right the one thing that's going to turn your business around or the person who's going to meet you and just give you that opportunity just hand it to you but there is an [Music] exception all right Sean I want to make you feel good I want to make the world feel good I saw an inspirational story this weekend and I want to share it with you and it's going to involve a little some audio and it involves pop culture which you don't know anything about so I I think that some of our listeners might know about the story but I think it'll be particularly cool for you uh all right so there's this singer songwriter guy I love his name's Noah Khan have you heard of Noah Khan Noah Khan I can't say I have he describes himself as the Jewish Ed Sheeran so uh he's like a good singer songwriter he's a great singer he's but he's got a little folk in his in his sound almost like mord and son meets Ed Sheeran but based out of Vermont like do you know anything about like do you know anything about like New England like folk music yeah yeah yeah I'm into that kind of music actually like The Lumineers type of type of deal um he uh graduated high school decided not to go to college and was able to get a small record deal right out of school the record deal it was only okay that sounds like a big deal but it's like you just kind of barely get by and they're almost like buying an option on you that you're going to be like a big deal he has a couple songs that are kind of hits I think one time he got to go on the Steven Kar show and play one of his songs but again that's not I mean that's a that's pretty awesome but if that's all you're known for is doing it one time you're still kind of like ah [ __ ] like I got to go get a job I'm not sure if this is going to work so the pandemic hits he's living in La at the time trying to make it big but he's like [ __ ] what am I going to do I I guess I'll just go back home to Vermont where my parents live and I have a little bit more space and he kind of like gets depressed where he's like eating bad food and smoking weed all day and he's like the hell do I am I going to do it my career I can't go out and play like I'm a nobody right now what am I going to do so he's like well Tik Tok I guess seems kind of neat let's try that and so he starts posting some of his songs on Tik Tok and a few of them do okay I think he gets like 50,000 followers or something like that uh so again it's like a a mediocre success but then one night he comes up it took some 20 minutes and he writes a verse to a song the song is called stick season and he plays this one verse on Tik [Music] Tok I'm [ __ ] I suck you suck this sucks [ __ ] all right so this is just a 20 second video that he posts on Tik Tok it's good but he posts it and like two or three hours later like no one replies he's like this sucks I'm just going to delete this thing but let me finish kind of getting high because he was said he was eating edible when he posted this he's like let me finish getting high he ends up passing out and sleeps through the night and he wakes up and this video gets like 200,000 likes and like 100,000 comments and he's like [ __ ] I better finish this song and actually complete this song cuz it sounds like people like this verse so this all happened in about 2021 so he finishes that song it blows up now two weeks ago this guy's from New England last week he sold out Fenway Fenway Park the stadium for like you know whatever 50,000 people and he brings his parents on stage click play are [Music] oh your mom she forgot that I [Music] exist so he writes that song he puts it out it blows up it goes viral the guy in a matter of three years goes from just a dude in his parents house playing on Tik Tok posting a verse of a song and what's funny is that in 2019 right when he was doing this he tweeted out he goes I'm probably not going to ever sell out Madison Square Garden in fact I'm probably not even going to sell all the shows that that I have for this tour but as long as you'll have me I'll keep writing some songs and he played Fenway Park and sold it out and actually a few days ago he sold out Madison Square Garden three nights in a row and I wanted to share this story with you because it makes me feel awesome it also shows that if you put your [ __ ] out there this is what the internet's for if you put your stuff out there even if it's incomplete people love seeing progress dude uh that's right up my alley so I have two or three things that that reminds me about the first is I forgot who it was we were talking to recently but we were I was having a discussion and the the idea came up that in most areas of life you shouldn't be hoping for like the miraculous save right the one thing that's going to turn your business around or the the person who's going to meet you and just give you that opportunity just hand it to you but there is in content an exception which is that in content you really one hit away and just because your earlier stuff hasn't taken off doesn't necessarily mean it's bad so you get a lot of false negatives but then sometimes you get these breakout positives and this is an example of that where you know the guy goes to sleep with no com you know he's basically planning to just delete the video thinks it was a bust and he was just one hit away from his entire life changing and there's something that's pretty magical about that when it comes to only a few areas of life like I think this is true in all the Arts so movies music content but also even games when we had Dan Porter on he was talking about his company and his company was failing and he basically had a few weeks left and he's like let's make one last game and I'll make it this time even though I'm not a game designer and he just made draw something this like stupid Simple app that just took off like wildfire and so being one being one hit away it's sort of a last bullet in the chamber that you can uh that you can think about and and and sort of continue to to operate with some with some hope on I think that's pretty powerful which which implies by the way that you're taking lots of shots dude so my most viral Twitter thread was that Clubhouse thread when Clubhouse was like you know all the rage and I came out and I posted this like really long thread like 30 40 tweets long about how I thought you know everybody thinks Clubhouse is going to take off or is is the next big thing but I don't think it's gon to work and the very first comment was this guy who worked at Facebook and when we were getting acquired by Facebook he was like the principal engineer who was like vetting all of our team and I post this thread and you know when you you know you push stand it's like that MailChimp GIF where the finger shaking right above the button and you're like you know you're putting yourself out there a little bit and his first thing is like dude this is way too long like nobody's going to read this this is too much and he said it in a way that wasn't even like a hater he was just like concerned like what are you thinking man like this is ridiculous and I was I was straight up about to just delete the whole thing and I just decided let me just let it ride for like a couple couple more minutes and then it started to just like immediately get a bunch of other positive replies but I was very close to just deleting the thing right there and that was a thread that went so viral that all of a sudden Malcolm gladwell's following me and there's all these like crazy things going on in the next you know three days of my life because that 10 20 million people read that and so it's just a reminder of Don't Count yourself out too early if it doesn't have the the the initial success that's the first thing second thing you found my fetish I am a sucker for amateur singing talent I have entire folders on YouTube and Tik Tok I don't want to see like famous people on stage polished I like you know when it's like this seventh grade boy and he just starts singing and like the rest of the class is like what Jacob what you could sing and like there's all these clips on Tik Tok that are like that and I'm a sucker for that stuff all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show and you know who has a moment like that who Justin Bieber you know right get discovered on YouTube you know who else got discovered a very funny way like that you said this guy's the Jewish Ed shiran Ed Sheran himself have you heard the story of how Ed Sheeran got discovered no I didn't I didn't know he was discovered that I know that he's been famous since he was like 16 so I guess it must have been when he was young so there's a couple interesting things we play this clip but there's a clip of Ed Sharon on a talk show and he's like everyone's like oh Ed you're so talented blah blah blah he goes listen to me when I was 14 he's like I kind of started to blow up in my like you know 17 18 19 age range I got discovered but here's me 134 when people say artists are born with Talent you're not you have to you have to really learn and really practice this is me playing guitar and singing I'm going to put it into my mic like this [Applause] it's okay so [Music] far I'm and then and then [Music] oh and it is awful I mean it sounds like if I pick up a guitar right now and I genuinely tried to sing it sounded that bad he's like yeah I just he's like that's how I started he's like it was really bad and he's like I kept practicing so what what ended up happening with Ed Sheran is he knows he wants to make it and he has like a little bit of of small following because he's from the UK so he comes to LA and he's like I'm gonna I'm gonna just come to the Mecca and just try to figure out how to make it in in this scene here and he does he gets a couple of fortunate breaks so he's he goes to like an open mic night type of thing and performs on stage and you never know who's in the crowd in the crowd is Jamie Fox's like business manager and he sees him and he's like this white boy is good he's like uh because he's like intrigued by him so he tells Jamie the next day he goes Jamie on your Jamie was doing a radio show in the morning he's hosting it he goes I have a guest for you I want you to have this guy come on five minutes so Ed Sharon comes on Jamie Fox's radio show he plays his like you a five minute bit and Jamie Fox is like all right I'm interested he so he's like What's your deal man who who are you uh you signed what what's your situation he like no no I mean I not only am I not signed I'm homeless I just came out here to La I don't have money I don't have anything so Jamie's like come sleep on my couch yeah and Jamie Fox has actually done this with many artists um that have have gone on to make it but he would just he's like if you have talent you got something he would just be like just come stay at my house I got tons of extra rooms just come stay here and Jamie Fox is notorious for throwing epic parties he's got like he's like one of the most connected guys in in Hollywood because he's a movie star he's a musician he's just he's he's a comedian he's very funny and so he would throw these almost like salons where he'd get people from movies from music from Comedy all come hang out at his at his house Neville uh madora and Noah Kagan went to one of them and they told me all about it what did they say they said he has a piano there in the in the other room and like people just slowly work their way towards the piano and it's almost like an open mic night he'll just start performing right yeah and like he'll Jamie starts and someone like raises their hands and someone else pops in and Like It's oddly a salon's a great way to describe it it's like a place to discover one another exactly and so he and cheran's there and he's I think he does that he like plays at one of the parties at night and people like oh this is kind of cool so the next night Jamie's like all right I'm gonna test this guy so he takes him to some Club that's basically like a all black club and every artist on stage is like either slam poetry rap R&B hip-hop and then here you have this like redhead freckled teenage boy holding a ukulele and they're like and next Ed Sheran and Ed Sheran comes up on the stage and he's literally with a ukulele and and literally Jamie Fox like I was in the crowd he's like and the my guy was like man Jamie come on why you got to [ __ ] up the vibe like who's this guy why you got to put this guy on the stage and so he improvises and he starts off doing his own song and then he's like all right read the room a little bit so he transitions into a freestyle version of 50 cents in the club and while he's on his ukulele basically and he plays like a edge Sheeran version of of a 50 cents WAP and so and the crowd just gets lit and there's a video of this online if you want to see it the first performance it's like kind of poor quality audio and video and literally during his performance people get so hyped that the the MC who was like pretty you know skeptical just gets on stage with him starts performing this girl gets up on stage starts performing with him and it just turns into this kind of thing and Jamie goes that's what I knew if he can win over this crowd he's going to win and then he made introductions and end up getting him signed dude I love those stories doesn't that make you feel good yeah that makes me feel so good I love those stories you have another inspirational story about my favorite thing on earth the Olympics yeah so the Olympics is going on right now the opening ceremony just happened and I saw this story that I hadn't heard before you you might know it because you're an Olympics guy have you ever heard of Eric the eel no I haven't heard this one okay so there's this guy Eric and Eric is from the Equatorial Guinea which is I guess a country and at the 2000 Olympics it's happening in Sydney there's this footage so I let me just work I don't know who this guy is I just see this footage the footage is this it's the Olympic swimming like trial and you see a guy uh black dude's got goggles on Trunks and he's just feeling nervous and there's two people next to him and it's about they're at the starting blocks and they're about to say go and the two other guys fall start they just jump in too early this guy doesn't move and so now this is the qualifying heat and his two competitors are disqualified and so you're like oh this guy gets a free run but what you don't know is that this guy Eric who's about to about to have a free pass into the thing it's not a free pass because this guy basically doesn't know how to swim yeah and like some background basically in most cases to qualify the Olympics for uh the the running or anything that's timed there's a qualifier so you have to hit a certain time but for some countries I don't know how they decide who they just get to have like it there a wild card uh draw so it's like a lottery r yeah and and they go to the country they go just send us your best so and so he wins this thing and he has eight months now to prepare for the Olympic Games can you just imagine that like you randomly win this draw and in eight months you're going to be swimming in front of the whole world this is a guy who's never left his home country he's never swam before and so he gets a he's given access to a hotel and in the hotel there's a pool that he could swim in for an hour a day 5: a.m. to 6: a.m. the pool is 13 M long he's swimming in the 100 meter freestyle so he's training in a 13 meter pool he's going to have to swim 10 times this distance in the thing in the real Olympics and he has one hour a day to train for eight months now pretty quickly Eric realizes like all right one hour day not going to be enough so he starts just going to like rivers oceans he's just trying to learn to swim he doesn't actually know how he doesn't have a coach and so when he's swimming in these Rivers there's literally fishermen who are watching him they're like son you got to you got to use your legs what are you doing and they're trying to teach him how to coordinate his body of float and this is what's happening so fast forward eight months it's go time he shows up at the Sydney Olympics takes him three days to travel there he's never flown before he gets the Olympic facilities jaw drops he he sees the the pool size he's like oh my god I've never swam in a pool this large and so he's preparing for the event and basically the other coaches and swimmers are like this some why is this guy so nervous during the practice he's not even going in the water he doesn't know what to do and so the South African coach starts helping him these other guys start helping him and they're like do you need goggles and they he's like yes and then they give him goggles and they're trying to show trying to teach him like in the day before the event he's cramming for the exam cramming for the exam for a language that you just learned two weeks ago and everyone in the world is watching you take the exam and if you fail the exam you drowned and you're dead and so that's the problem because when the other two guys fall start he's going to get a free pass all he has to do is finish but he's never swam 100 meters consecutively he's trained it in a 13 meter pool and so he jumps in and he starts okay and he's going and he's going and he starts getting really tired before he even hits the turn the 50 meter turn and he finally gets to the turn and at the turn he stays under for so long there's literally like gasps in the crowd they think he's drowned like he's just caught in like a rip tide basically that looks like finally comes up and he's going so slow it looks like he can't make it he is so exhausted and the crowd just starts going nuts they're like go go go they don't know why this guy's going so slow why is this a I they don't know at this point but they know something's wrong and they just want to like get on his side it's like a Jamaican bob sled moment exactly he finishes in a minute and 52 seconds which is like you know like an extra like you know minute past what it should have been which is a very long time for something like this you know these races are decided by Tenth of a second and so he qualifies and so he gets into the actual Olympic trial he he obviously then uh you know loses but this guy embodies that Olympic spirit that anyone anywhere in the world can you know do something amazing Crowd Goes Nuts he ends up becoming the national coach for his country you know decades later and and that's the story of Eric the eel did they did they ever produce any legit uh swimmers well let's keep the story inspirational so I'm gonna no comment that one I I don't know if there's ever been a medalist from uh Equatorial Guinea that's awesome no I remember watching this years ago um and it and it and it is inspirational do you want to do your sleep at thing or do you want me to tell you about a car thing uh let's do your car thing all right so I'm buying a I want to buy a new car and I want to tell you about two interesting things that I've discovered we'll start with car Edge so it's a pretty genius business idea and these guys have been quietly building up a pretty epic business so the story of this business is that it was started by a father and son Duo the father's name is Ry the son is Zach the father he basically managed C dealerships for years and he he was like oh there's like I know the ins and outs and his son I think was 24 or 25 at the time and his son always wanted to start an internet business and he also liked YouTube and he was like Hey Dad what if I just asked you some questions on YouTube about like you know how you properly negotiate at the car dealership or how much profit car dealerships make so we know better what to ask for you know things like that love it gonna work yeah and within I think something like eight weeks they got 13,000 followers on this YouTube page and they were like you know we were going to buy all these fancy cameras but then we just got like our iPhone and made it kind of janky and it just people kind of liked it and it was during the pandemic so people were watching a lot of that stuff and so they parlay that into starting a business called car Edge and so if you go to car edge.com what's it say do you see the headline uh yeah it says your personal car Shopper is here no hassle always fair prices so basically they will help you buy a car so the way it works is there's this thing called an Auto Broker or a car broker I think you got your car now from a friend of ours who's a car broker the industry is typically like Mom and Pop and a lot of times if you Google like car broker New York City you're going to go to like kind of a momand pop website and you get on the phone or send an email to this person you tell them what type of car you want and they have relationships with tons of dealers so they know they know the ins and outs of the car business you pay them a fee $500 to $2,000 and they typically will go and buy the car for you but the savings that you get on the price of the car is typic Ty Al better than the fee that you pay them and so it's no big deal and they do all the negotiating for you so it's not uncomfortable for you whatever cool what these guys did is they took like kind of a stupy internet Vibe and they created a nice website for it where you go to their website and they you could you could search different cars will rather they have a variety of products so like one they have got this thing it's I think it's like 80 bucks a month or 50 bucks a month and they will just like give you tons of information like a database on what the profit margin is on different cars so you can go negotiate their s or you can spend $1,000 and tell them the car that you want and they go and buy it for you and they'll even organize it so it gets shipped to you and they do all the organization and all that work and if you don't save at least ,ar you just get your money back and they built this massive business because if you go to their YouTube page I think they now have 600,000 subscribers on their page and it's this really cute dynamic between a father and son all the pictures on the site by the way are like the dad giving the son a noie it's like just a just wholesome just so wholesome and that F father and son like Dynamic for the brand it makes you like them a lot and they're like you know there were a bunch of car podcasts but we basically what they described what they wanted to do is they probably have no idea who we are but it's what you and I do of just kind of like riffing a little bit less professional you're the father I would assume am I you're older than me you could be the dad you know how there was this big viral thing where was like um you know PewDiePie versus t- series like who can have the most subscribers on YouTube yeah so these these guys currently have 533,000 subscribers your boys have 529,000 we are 4,000 subscribers behind car Edge I'm just going to leave that there for our loyal Army who doesn't want to see us lose to this fatherson car buying Duo go to YouTube and subscribe all right yeah back to this they uh this business is now doing so he he has a a video where he breaks down the revenue so he pulls up their QuickBooks and see it but he blurs out the numbers and I messaged him and I was like hey uh I have this thing this podcast like and he goes yeah you know I've heard of it uh I go just can you tell me the numbers and I could talk about it and he and so he did and so this business is now doing roughly $10 million a year in Revenue I think it's only two years old or so and it seems like a great business these things could be really cool I think honestly I thought it'd be almost bigger because looking at the traffic they get almost like 2 million visitors a month to their site and so that is a huge amount of traffic to your website for this thing so I am I'm extremely impressed this is only two years old is yeah it could it could be three but yeah something like that is this something you normally do when you buy cars you use Car Brokers I haven't but I've heard of them we actually talked about it years ago of of people who you know we brought this up in one of the early episodes I've never actually used it but I remember last time I bought my car I was in the dealership for like four hours like signing paperwork W wiring the money it took forever and I was like I'm never doing this again and so I just started Googling Car Brokers I was like I want to try one and that's how I found these guys and were they YouTube first so it was an audience first yeah YouTube first did they even plan to launch this as a service or did it start it's just let's make a YouTube channel the kid Zach has a Blog where he's been blogging since he was 22 and he previously he ran some small information business that was doing like 150,000 in revenue and it's cool you could see him blogging as he goes and he's like I've always wanted to learn how to make money on the internet and start an Internet company and so you could see like he had like two or three businesses that weren't huge or anything but it was very promising for a 21-year-old and I have a feeling I kind of like clicked their LinkedIn and looked around I think the mother passed away from cancer and so I think there was like a a feeling of like Zach the kid was like you know I want to be with my father more let's see if we can do something together yeah he's got some cool blog posts so getting your first customers is really hard and he talks about the getting their early customers for this and then another one is from 10 to 14,000 subscribers in three weeks here's what we learned here's what happened and here's what I learned and then I haven't read these yet but I'm just looking at the titles these are cool I'm going to check these out yeah this is a cool kit I think now I think he's only 25 I think I think he's young um and it's just a really promising business and on some of the blog posts he talks about how he's like now I have to project financials so we can decide when to hire people and so you're actually seeing him do this in real time but he's not in un and I's world and so it's a really fun business to pay attention to and see what this guy uh what is he going to build isn't how cool is this fatherson businesses like um or just like you know parent kid but in not in a uh succession you know hand me- down type of way so a couple examples of this we had Al Don come on and talk about Missouri Star the the the biggest quilting store on the internet and it's Al and his mom and he's like you know Alan I think his name her name is Debbie I don't know he's like yeah like same thing YouTube channel where she makes content and she's the star and Al was the like cool I'll figure out the internet and like e-commerce part of this and let's make this at thing and this is a nine figure business that sells quilt supplies to other moms across the the country it's amazing and it's Al's mom that do that that business together or and Al does a thing that I love when he refers to his mother he doesn't say my mom he goes yeah I was just hanging out and mom wanted to like Quil you know like when they when they use mom as like as a proper noun I love I'm like whenever I hear someone do that that like when they just refer to them as mom not my mom yeah so it's Al and and Jenny they basically created and she and her YouTube videos are great by the way I've like randomly watching though I have no I have no interest in quilting but I'm interested in her videos because she's so wholesome and she's so good on camera so I think that's a great example we had the the guys from Farm con and awag same thing father and son doing business together but not in a um Legacy you know you could take over my business but they started new businesses together and I just think that's so cool you know if my kids want to do something like that that'll be a blast I I would love that more than anything I think if I had to bet more often than not it turns negative but if you get the right if you get the right parent child relationship it's like magical it seems like the greatest thing on Earth yeah but they they say that about everything like doing business doing a business with your friends like oh don't mix business and friends or family like I've done both I've done business with my wife with my sister-in-law with my best friends like I've done businesses with all of them and but it's high risk High reward when it works it feels like a cheap code because the trust is there the fun is there and it's like what why wouldn't I want to do life with people of course and when it goes wrong you're like what the hell was I thinking well do you know who Coco goof is she's the tennis player who was the flag bearer in the Olympics I was reading about her last night because she's she's been inspirational lately and her father uh was like man when she was like nine where like wow this our little girl is like very promising so both the mom and dad quit their job moved to Florida where their extended family was to help care for their their kids and they went all in on trying to teach her tennis and so the father who was I think a college football player didn't know anything about tennis learned about tennis became her coach and she would say uh yeah it was really challenging that relationship but we came up with a really good solution the center of the Court was Switzerland and if him and I had an argument we would come to the middle and then Mom would come and be the third party and decide who was right and who was wrong and would help us like figure things out and so like they built like a good system where they could communicate effectively for the last you know 20 years however long they've been coaching together all right let me tell you one last thing about this car stuff that I found so there's this hilarious Tik Tock series created by car dealership this is Mohawk Chevrolet yes it's called Mohawk Chevrolet it's just a normal like Chev Chevy truck dealer dude is this like the office like what's happening listen to this they hired this young woman to be a social media person she's 23 from Kentucky or what University of Kentucky something like that and within six months in the job she films a video where they place or she put a bunch of random ducks like rubber ducks all over the dealership and everyone's trying to figure out who put the Ducks there because it's kind of annoying and she films this office like series of her interviewing people and then showing like cutaways of what's going on and it hits on Tik Tok and So eventually she creates a 10 episode series about the dealership where it's all uh they're all improving but it is like in a like an Emmy award-winning like series wow dude this is such a good find this is so cool so so I think they've got millions and millions of views and the young woman who did it is like I said 23 and Chevy and Geico and all these huge brands are commenting making jokes on the Tik toks and so many people are like for real this should be on Netflix like I want to watch this and some uh Twitter uh person I guess I I think a sub stacker her name's Rachel carton I want to give her a shout out she discovered this and interviewed Grace on substack on her substack and she did a really cool interview where she talks about the process and she's like well me and Ben my partner we just come up with interesting ideas we don't write scripts I just go into the corner of this like as if she's Pam she's like I sit there like Pam and I just kind of Babble and we like find like a few minutes of like gold and we build a story off that and then we go and we make episodes every week and she is wonderful this is the greatest thing I've seen where people are like hey what's gonna happen next episode and the characters are just other people in the dealerships like the mechanics or whatever the episodes will be like today my boss Jim the owner of the dealership has want me wants me to make a video about electric Chevys because no one wants to buy him because they're afraid of them I don't know what I'm gonna do and it's like the the episode is like her trying to figure that out it is so good that's amazing uh yeah I want to check this out and also Grace you said her name is is that her name Grace Kerber yeah I haven't even seen a single video yet I just heard about this literally a minute and a half ago Grace I'd like to make you a job offer whatever you're making currently at the dealership we're tripling it come work for us you got to do this at a different scale than the local car dealership but that is uh that is so impressive this is amazing she's a really good actress like she like leans into it yeah I can just see from the thumbnail here it's like so good and the most impressive part is imagine a 23-year-old coming into a truck dealership which is probably all dudes particularly like frat Bros right and she's like yeah we're going to do it this way uh like let's just do it beautiful because they're probably like we're not even doing Tik Tok we have nothing to lose right like you know when you have nothing to lose you could try something new here you could never do this at you know the corporate account for you know for Cadillac or whatever someone on Twitter was like looking at the search traffic for Mohawk Chevrolet and as expected it's through the roof uh so I guess it's working so those are my two car stories that was great great segment uh good finds okay I have a cool find for you I want to tell you about a well and health app that's doing over 100 million a year you might think is this Health Care is it AI is it biotech no no I'm talking about Pokemon sleep have you ever heard of Pokemon sleep no just check this out Pokemon the Pokemon company has created a sleep tracking app where you just take your phone you put it on your pillow right next to you while you sleep and depending on how well you sleep and how long you sleep you catch Pokemon in your sleep and you wake up in the morning It's a sleep tracker that catches Pokemon based on how how well or how poorly you slept a gamified sleep tracking now this app is blowing up it is huge in Japan right now I think like 40% of their users are all in Japan and they've done over a hundred million in revenue on this app already isn't this insane what how well this inap purchases basically what do you buy go look on Reddit so if you go look on Reddit you can find people talk about this I'm just going to read you a couple of Reddit posts it says to be honest my my true intent with Pokemon sleep is just to have a consistent bedtime and it definitely helps with that I was never the type to lay in bed with my on my phone playing games but this does help me just put away my phone put it on the pillow and even though it's not super accurate it is helping me and another one is like you know I did move my bedtime from 2: am to 10 p.m. daily because I was getting frustrated at having to wake up with so little sleep I tried so many things they all failed Pokemon sleep managed to make a lifestyle change at $2,000 in therapy has not I'm even willing to spend money on a occasionally buying bundles in the app because it's actually cheaper than what I was paying to to try to improve my sleep before this oh my God this is insane is this owned by like Nintendo or the whoever it's owned by Pokemon like if you go to the site it's Pokemon company International it's like corporate. pokemon.com is like the uh the thing behind it but it's got 10 million users only 177% are in the US so I think there's an opportunity to basically what they're obviously going to try to grow in the US but I think there's an opportunity to just replicate the same idea which is I've had this thought which is Health tracking right now is all quantitative and nobody really just does a remix of it that's fun step tracking is a super common thing everybody likes step tracking but step tracking has just been the same so everybody just looks at oh did I get my 10,000 steps today and it's just me vers me really um and it's step tracking and even the ones that try to make it social where you might be able to add friends and whatever it's not really a social thing to do and I had this idea years ago of like why don't they just make it look like Mario Kart where it's me and my eight friends at the start starting line each day and then as we're taking steps like we each have our little car that's ahead or behind the other person and it'll tell you if you get passed by somebody during the day like oh Sam just passed you um and then you look at the map you're like oh [ __ ] Sam's like you know a thousand steps ahead I'm gonna actually go get some more steps in and you would have your car that would you you know you could buy your skins or whatever make it make it look however it's like take the same idea but just make it more do the fun variants do the social and fun variant versus the uh the hardcore Data Tracking version me and uh four friends uh a few years ago we did it a couple years in a row where I think it was every January we would wear was it a whoop band and we would the person who burned the most energy for the entire month one and so it becomes like this crazy competition where it's like [ __ ] I can't I can't go to sleep right now because John Burns I gotta go burn some calories like John's winning and it just who can exert the most energy in January and it's exhausting it is so exhausting I think Joe Rogan does that with friends right yeah we we definitely stole that idea from him what what what does he call it sober October sober October yeah yes uh but when he started it there weren't the bands didn't really exist and so once they came out we took the bands and we did the same thing those competitions 100% work there's a guy I follow on Twitter who walks 30,000 steps a day and it is like and then everyone else will post their steps like their step counts that that uh night just to like compare it 100% makes you want to walk more right so actually I had an interesting conversation um at this event I was at with with Nick Gray so Nick Gray who side not might be my favorite person he's a treasure he was talking about he's like dude he's like my first the my first muscle challenge you guys did was so wholesome he's like was so fun I did it with my friends he's like my buddy who I did it with who didn't even listen to the Pod before that started listening he's like he also now if he's just like traveling and needs a quick workout like what can I do in you know 15 20 minutes he's like he just does that again and he texts me every time he does it so he I think Nick created a version of that called done which I loved he's like he's like you should steal this he's like you guys should do this he's like keep the momentum of the my first muscle challenge so he has a thing called done it's like a group of people that all agree we're going to do X every day and I forgot what x is it might be walk a certain amount of steps might be cold PL might be whatever it was let's assume you set the bar and what he did was he made a WhatsApp group and in the WhatsApp group you only can send one word done and that's it every every day people just say done whenever they' did the thing and and you can't say anything else but you get the momentum from other people saying done you're like [ __ ] I got to get mine in and then he has his assistants he's got these like assistants in the Philippines who will go in and if if you haven't set done for like three or four days they'll like DM you they'll nudge you and they'll be like come on man like you could do this uh you know stay in it and um I just thought that was great he's like you should you should definitely like keep that alive in some way he's like do the done group it's amazing and so I think we should uh we should come up with a new A new challenge like that and just do it the way Nick did with one word keep it super simple done I think what we need to do is do the my first muscle challenge again except we tell people when it's happening I think people will I mean I know I I would train to get because I hadn't if you don't work that Energy System it's quite hard uh like I would train for it did you um you were with Nick this weekend did you meet any other people at this event I met a ton of people um what would you like to know so here here's a fun way where you can maybe do this so I came home and I brain dumped all of my not into this stock but I did it almost like a Twitter thread where I um they're not it's not like a Long blog post with one coherent message I just bullet pointed like you know 30 bullet points so I want you to just pick a number let's do three of them I won't do too many of them pick three of them just pick random numbers and uh between one and 30 and I'm just going to read you whatever that bullet was and these are notes to myself so I'll have to add some context but uh but go well I can't see them that's right yeah you can't see them just say the number well one okay one um the best advice is Free by definition okay so what does this mean at this event there's lots of talk speakers on stage that sort of thing um are you gonna say what the event is we didn't actually say oh yeah yeah sorry so Andrew Wilkinson our buddy Andrew host a event called interesting people and this is the second year he's done it so he invites a bunch of people out to where he lives in Victoria Canada and it's supposed to just be a mixing of interesting people that either he knows really well like some people he like grew up with with some people he knows from the internet and some people he doesn't know but they sounded interesting when they applied it's probably 80 90 people super well well-run event um had had a blast so while I was there I was thinking about um conferences in general and I realized the best advice is Free by definition and what I mean by this is this advice that is truly great is actually incredibly simple advice if it if it would apply to you almost in a generic way it's going to be simple and almost like hilarious iously uncomplicated like if I said Sam you know nothing about me but you know that I want to get in shape tell me what to do you have like you know 15 seconds go ahead tell me what to do one gram of protein per pound lift weights three days a week walk 10,000 steps a day great now if I said if you wanted to create a course around that maybe you could but you'd have to make it complicated you'd have to add a whole bunch of other things like the best advice in the world tends to be incredibly simple so simple that you couldn't charge for it so the best advice is free because either the great advice is so simple You couldn't possibly charge for it it would be laughable to charge for something like that to say what yeah eat Whole Foods you know try to get enough protein walk and get good sleep right or whatever right exercise three times a week do weight lift these are such simple things you can't create a whole course or program around it in that simple way and the other side is advice that is uh nonobvious like that the non-common sense advice is like hard one like wisdom usually comes from people who are so successful that they would be willing to give it away for free so the advice from the real winners of Life they're not charging you for it because they've won they're fully abundant and they're happy to pass on what worked for them and so I realize that the best advice comes at either end of that barbell it either comes from people who are so successful that they wouldn't think to charge for it because that'd be beneath them or it's so simple that you couldn't possibly charge for it because it takes a minute to tell you the answer and after that it's about you following it and so I think that that is a a general way that I'm now think ofice anything that falls in the middle is the midwin it's basically advice that is overly complicated you're paying for it and um and ultimately like you haven't actually found the most useful version of the advice were there any people who you met who were shockingly amazing or interesting Nick Gray Greg Eisenberg so Greg a lot of people know Greg because he's on Twitter or whatever Greg is 10 times more fun in person than he is online you might even like his online content but I'm just saying he's that much better in person he's just got he is he is just like a walking Vibe whatever I'm around him it's just fun I'm laughing and um it's very interesting what's going on and I guess the way I approach these events is I'm just looking for two or three people that I think are you know like amazing and I'm just um I'm looking for people who just have a certain energy about them a certain way of being that is good to interact with because I already have a day-to-day life a routine if I'm getting out of my routine to go to something I don't want to just spend it with uh don't I don't want to spend my my my my time out of my routine doing the same things I would do in my routine so I try to make an effort to hang out with people who are uh maybe people I don't hang out with all the time or um hang out in a way that is not just like you know my normal normal Zone that I'm in was there anyone else that fell into that category or any insight that you got okay I'll give you one note here not necessar something that changed my mind but something that I thought was pretty insightful so Patrick Campbell did a a breakout session and Patrick's talk was basically like after he sold his company and Patrick's been on the pot before uh talking about how he sold his company for like I don't know $250 million and what happened after that and he said something that I I I really liked the question I asked him I go if your brother sold this company now you can give him some advice on like what to do in the kind of the year after you sell what should I just sold what should I how should I think now knowing what just went through what would you advise him he said well first thing probably like no M don't make any major moves for like six to n months no major purchases I think you did this too right no major purchases for for six to nine months he said it well he goes don't worry you have the rest of your life to spend this money so you don't you don't have to be in a rush the money's there um the next thing he said was he hired a guy this coach um Jack SK and he he helped him do kind of like a Life 360 kind of like a uh you know people do these like 360 reviews where they interview like 10 people around you um Andrew's done this Patrick's done this with the same guy and basically this guy who interrogates people when when this guy stood up to do his intro during the event he goes um he said my name's Jack and I um when I was TW when I was 30 years old I found the thing that I could do better than anybody I'd ever met and I realized that that's the thing I should be doing with my life he's like you're not going to ask me the thing like what's what's the thing and he goes I look into people's eyes and I can see their soul he's like basically I can um I can meet people I can talk to them I can ask them question I can figure out who they really are what they're really all about so Patrick said he's like you know he asked me a bunch of questions and he he's like he really interrogates you and the people around you to try to figure out who is this guy what's he all about what does he love when when is he at his best when is he at his worst that sort of thing and what he what Patrick said was he took a very intentional approach to this introspection he's he's like he's like me and my wife did an offsite he's like we did an offsite and at the offsite you know we talk kind of like what do we want out of life you know the material part of our life the emotional part of our life the lifestyle he's like and we made a list and then we kind of talked about it together and he's like U we compared we said three things he goes I would share something that I wanted out of life and either it would be cool go for it like you know you do you or it would be cool I want to do it with you let's do that together or I'm not down with that uh like I don't think that's in you know congruent with what I want and and he also said that he made a scorecard for himself and he said one thing on the scorecard that I really like so on his scorecard he was like you know I check in every six months or so whatever and I think about you know accomplishments I'm proud of my wins um things that I'm bad at that I've accepted that I'm bad at so like things I'm bad at that I'm not working on improving but I'm at peace with the way they are um then it's things that I'm working on and then the last one is like losses I will no longer live with and he's like this is L's that I'm no longer willing to take so things that I are not okay in my life that I need to make a change but I'm not already making that change and I thought it was very useful to do this bucketing because when he said these none of them sounded that surprising but I never really asked myself those questions you know what are you know all four of those what are the wins what are the things I'm bad at that I'm accepting what are the things that I'm bad at that I'm not accepting I'm working on and what are the the areas of my life I'm no longer willing to tolerate the losses I'm I'm no longer willing to tolerate and what I like about these is it normalized is having kind of these highs and lows in your life and I know that most people try to bury things like you know here's some the AR of my life I don't feel great about but I don't really want to address them because when I do I just feel like ashamed and kind of guilty and I feel like bad about myself when I do so because I feel bad about myself when I address these I don't address them I just stash them and I thought it was a very useful way of um thinking because it brings it all to light says well yeah of course there's these buckets and of it would be silly of me to not have anything in one of these buckets like of course I've got to have some wins I've got to have some things I'm bad at I've got to have some things that I want to change I've got to have some things that I feel like I'm making progress on like and every bucket should have something in it and that's nothing to be feel bad about I thought that was just a very useful um exercise that I think more people could could benefit from I think um a takeaway that I've had of hanging out with people like Patrick and other people who uh maybe people earlier in their career look up to of which Patrick should be that type of person you I think that when you quote make it you don't have doubts and you don't spend money on Fufu [ __ ] like a Life 360 you spend even more on that type of stuff because it's just still incredibly necessary do you know what I mean more necessary than ever I'm reading this Jack SK website and this is something that previously I would look at back out on and be like who needs that like if you're G to kick ass you're gonna kick ass now I'm reading it and I'm like I want this I need answers I have no answers this man has the ANS I mean the headline says discover your true life purpose and Direction with the road map right you know if I if I hit that normally I'm bouncing but when you hear about it in the context of a story and your friends have done it and you're at a certain time of your life it makes total sense to to invest in things like this this is awesome um well that's good it was a good trip it was a lot of fun it's also I mean it was cool because I would say 60 70 80% of the people there like listen to MFM which is great you're popular well yeah but like more more than that I mean a lot of people had cool stories of stuff that we've talked about that they could they would come up and share they'd be like oh dude like whether it was just like oh I hit my first million and I'm like yeah cool I'm like a genie I appear when you hit your first million that's it you just say the words and and it happens um or there's people who are like yeah you guys talked about this and I went and did all these things and here's what's happened since and normally you don't get that feedback loop right when we get on here people don't realize like I just treat this like I'm just hanging out with you and I'm trying to tell you interesting things you're telling me interesting things and I get excited and then we get off and like that's kind of it uh only now we're starting to be involved even with like the thumbnails and the titles to be like hey guys like can we just like I don't care if it gets less clicks just make us look less stupid please um you know like that that's kind of like our level of involvement post post episode um but we definitely don't really get as much feedback as there is so that was I would say the most fun part was people coming up and having stories that were that branched off of something that we talk about one time you and I talked about this World War II book that I was reading about uh and we talked about Hitler because he was part of the book and like the headline that we had used or somebody picked for the video was like Leadership Lessons From the Third Reich from the Third Reich and I was like oh my God no do not do that delete delete delete that is not what I meant oh dude I also had a lesson learned so I gave a I gave two talks at this event I had one good talk and I had one dog [ __ ] talk and that was a great lesson to learn of just eating [ __ ] and realizing five minutes into the talk oh I've made a huge mistake so the first one was just a breakout session and she was like well you could just do whatever you want and I was like cool I'm not even going to have a topic going in I'm GNA talk to the people there and we're GNA we're going to like figure out what do people want to talk about and then we'll improvise we'll riff so I'll tell you about the good one and then the bad one so the actually I'll tell you about the bad one first so here's what what went wrong with the bad one these are Lessons Learned in public speaking so I um I get up on the stage and I grab the microphone and I can't help myself but try something that I've never done before that I have not prepared for but I just want to see what happens so I go for that which was actually that part was okay so they had Matthew dicks the storytelling guy give like the opening talk at the event so he he was like the 9:00 am and I was like the 4 P pm. so at the 9:00 am thing he gets on there and he tells a great story and he he's got he's like a Prof he does these speeches everywhere so like he's ready to tell us how in business storytelling can be super valuable so I'm writing a ton of notes and I'm inspired I'm already a believer in storytelling so you're preaching to the choir right it's like the Kool-Aid Man burst through the wall and I already had my cup ready pour it on in and so he convinces us that how important storytelling is but the next 10 you know five speakers or whatever they already knew what they were going to say so they get on stage and they don't really tell a story and I'm like dude we all heard that right storytelling's the [ __ ] so I was like I'm going to try to tell a Matthew dick story at the start of my talk and so 15 minutes before I supposed to go on there's like a little break and I decided to like try to write a story that I'm going to tell which is probably not enough time to do that but whatever gave it a shot I was like I'm here I'm gonna get my reps in so I got my rep in I tried to give the talk I would say okay at least I get credit for trying something new and everybody understood why my story was like not so great was because I just obviously made it up like you know a few minutes before now after that I decide I'm like you know what conferences are these usually it's like you get on stage and you're supposed to have the answer like here's how you do it right here's how you do X and you're supposed to be the know-it-all genius who like you know that's what the guy on stage is doing so I decide you know what I'm gonna be different and being different the thing that don't tell you about being different is when it works awesome when it doesn't work you're just [ __ ] weird and so I decideed to go on stage and tell people about all the ways that I have failed and lost money so specifically the decisions I've made that have been the worst for me in terms of success in finance how how I've lost you know $100 million to these seven or eight really poor decisions and I get on stage I start giving the talk and what I realized is this is a downer this is an absolute Debbie Downer and even though my information might be good and the principles in this might be good I am basically making everybody in this room State change downward I should be leaving them on a high note it's the end of the event we should be like you know light-hearted everyone's done a full day they're tired they're not looking for something heavy and I came in like a weighted blanket on that crowd and so five minutes in I was like oh this is a bad idea I shouldn't have done this and I didn't have the skills to um you know pull out of that nose dive and change my topic and I'm sure to them it was fine but I know in my head what a good talk feels like when I give it it's it could be electric you know like people are laughing and they're they're writing notes furiously and they're feeling good and afterwards they're buzzing and they they they want to run through a wall afterwards this was like the wall ran through them so I I feel like uh that was a a big mistake on my part there what was the winning one the winning one was basically the opposite of that so I as soon as the talk happened or as soon as they're like all right get your breakout sessions everybody and mine was in the main room so they were like people just like stayed in their seat and it's like a f minute break so everyone just like stays in their seat they're like kind of on their phone checking their email but and I was like oh no no I got to I got to sh the energy first and foremost it doesn't matter what I'm going to say I got to shift the energy so I had the the inside at that point to do it I just didn't have it at the other talk and so I um I immediately was like all right everybody come over here to this side of the room bring a chair let's make a circle like circles have a different energy in general than somebody on stage and everybody sitting in a crowd facing them not seeing each other and I had them move bring their chair come over here quickly make a circle and then I did a little bit of crowd work almost like a comedian there was a guy in the group who um who who I had known and had a funny encounter with before this I he used to be in like a mastermind group of mine before this and I kicked him out because I was like it was like four straight meetings where he would say the same thing and be stuck at the same plateau and I kicked him out I was like dude Alex like honestly I think the best thing I could do for you is not even let you come here and say this same story again because you're just like getting into a rut don't come back here till you've doubled revenue and I just like kicked him out and actually he's like 8X since then in they like three years since then and so he's done incredibly well and so I was like I haven't seen you in a while like how are things going any attention here like no dude it was great I 8X it's all good and so anyways and I had I did this thing where people were like how do you do X whatever and I had us do like a like a push-up thing to like change the energy like in that in that moment like let's get the blood flowing because one of my principles is good decisions come from good energy so if you are trying to figure something out you're trying to make a decision or you're trying to Rally your team if you're doing it from a state where everybody's tired or stressed or afraid about what's going on or just literally like half paying attention that is not where great ideas or great decisions um come from and so the first thing you do is you shift your your state and then you make your decision then you try to ask yourself the question of how are we going to make this happen um and so I I showed people like how quickly you can change your energy like watch this like 15 seconds 20 seconds you'll be you'll be feeling different than you are right now and so that was a much better thing where it didn't really matter what I said but crowd work in order to make it more interactive keeps everybody on their toes because they don't know when I'm going to talk to them um and then Shifting the energy first and worrying about information later uh was the smart move there so it was a good trip then I mean I uh it looked awesome I saw the list of people going yeah it was cool tons of great people all right that's the p for

11 years ago this month I gave up alcohol and in today's episode I want to share some of the things that I've learned along the [Music] way all right 11 years ago I gave up alcohol and in today's episode I want to share some of the things that I've learned since then so the reason I'm doing this is my at my one-year anniversary of giving up drinking I wrote this blog post you can Google it it's called six things I learned from not drinking for a year and today I thought I'll recap that blog post but also share some of the things that I didn't add to the blog post that have kind of come true in the last 10 years and I'm sharing here on my first million because I think a lot of people would enjoy this but also because this isn't just about giving up alcohol so doesn't matter if you're giving up drinking or you want to give up drinking or you want to just create a new habit I have found that these things that I've learned they can apply to anyone trying to make a major life change and so lesson number one figure out your why and go all in on that and so let me explain so I started drinking in my late teens with just my friends just like most people when they start doing it but what I noticed was that it it dled my anxiety a ton and I am a pretty anxious person I don't know if you could tell if you listen to this podcast I bet you can but I have a fairly high anxiety and I noticed that when I started drinking my anxiety it just like kind of went away and so as I got more and more into drinking I was just like this feels awesome I don't feel anxious I'm going to keep doing it so it was very much self-medication and by the time I was like 21 I was super into alcohol to the point where probably ages 22 to 23 I was intoxicated basically 24 hours a day I was drunk 24 hours a day first thing in the morning you start you go all day and then you wake up a little drunk or a little little hung over and you just keep going and so I realized one night I was blowing it I always felt I was kind of special I felt like I had this fire in me that I could do something interesting but I was completely blowing it and I felt I wanted to feel life because I didn't really feel like a lot of emotions uh during that period because they were hidden and so my reason was I wanted to feel life and I wanted to not ruin my potential and so like funerals wedding celebration meeting someone you like breaking up with that person I think I and many other people we would drink because for some reason we didn't want to face reality whether it's trauma you had or I'm not sure why other people experien it but you want to like cover it up and I'm not against alcohol and drugs for other people but for me it basically just like masked how I felt and I hated that and then I realized that when I got sober facing challenging situations it felt like this massive adrenaline rush I felt like so good about facing things that I previously was nervous about so it took about 6 months uh after getting sober but on on month six month seven month eight I noticed that I would face these challenging situations like for example I was 23 24 when I quit and like like every single 23 24 year old guy meeting girls is like the number one focus in my life and I noticed that when I was like six seven months in at first I was super nervous to go up and talk to a girl sober but then I did it one time and I felt oh my God that was a rush I got to feel that again I got to feel that again I got to feel it again and I noticed that it happened with business it happened with so many other facets of my life that I got to feel this extreme emotion that for a lot of sober people it's probably just that's just how they feel but it felt awesome and so I felt like I was alive again and so I actually loved like confrontation I loved like nervous feelings because it felt like a rush to experience some of those things and so it was important to lean into that and I had to sit down for a minute and figure out why am I doing this and I just always try to remind myself that and I think that that's the case for any goal that you try to do when you change your life is you got to constantly remind yourself why are you actually doing this lesson number two tell your friends so I originally tried giving up booze because I was in college and I was like like this is a problem this is just a huge issue that I have I was basically living by by myself my senior year of college and starting my sophomore year of school it was like full-blown an issue and so I went two years like that and I lived by myself basically so like no one would know that I was screwed up and I also had a hot dog stand and that was like my business I've talked about here a lot of times the reason I had that business was you could own a hot dog stand and sell hot dogs from 11 to three and be intoxicated and most people won't know because they just think that you're acting goofy and so that's one of the reason why I did it and so I basically didn't tell anyone and then the first time I got sober I just went cold turkey and I got super sick a lot of people don't talk about this but with alcohol but I'm pretty sure there's only two drugs you can die from if you try to do it on your own and you could have withdrawals and die and that's alcohol and opioids and so I got really sick like five days in to giving up booze and I went to my college doctor and they like measured my blood pressure and they're like man your blood pressure is like through the roof what the hell is going on and I had to explain to them what what the issue was and that was the first time that I ever vocalized it and so we had to go to the hospital that day and I had to tell the hospital that was an issue and it was like really embarrassing and I felt horrible about even like vocalizing that I remember I was like in tears practically I was like oh man I can't believe I just said that out loud but it definitely felt better but I didn't tell anyone once I got out of the hospital I still didn't mention it to anyone and then eventually after a few months uh I was going to graduate college and I moved to San Francisco to try to make it in the internet world and I relapsed because when I got out to San Francisco I wanted to meet new friends I wanted to impress these guys who I moved in with even though I doubt they were impressed by drinking I somehow felt I needed to impress them and I was like yeah let's go party let's go do this and we went out and I got pressured and I caved in and I and I ended up drinking again and then it took about another year of kind of going crazy and I eventually went to a homeless Clinic in San Francisco it was called the San Francisco south of Market Mental Clinic I think is what it was called it was for homeless people pretty much like at the time I had just left my job to start the hustle and I didn't have any income and so I technically qualified to like go to this homeless clinic but in in a weird way I was like uh I'm a I'm a I'm basically a bum like I I deserve to be here like uh I'm ruining uh everything I deserve to be with these other uh addicts and I met this doctor her name's Joselyn porz I saw her up until recently actually she gave me this advice she was like you should tell your your friends tell your roommates that you're having an issue I was so freaking afraid to do that and so I kind of worked up the courage with her encouragement and I eventually told my roommates and I was like hey guys I I've got a drinking issue um and so uh you can live your life the way you want to live your life and I'm not going to judge you I'm totally fine with you guys doing what you want to do but from this point on I'm sober and I'm not going to drink alcohol and I would love it if you could encourage me and I felt like the biggest weight lifted off my shoulders and I noticed that when I felt that weight it go away it it became so much easier and so I had no problem after that telling a bunch of other friends and a few of my friends at the time they kind of bailed on me and I was kind of bombed for a minute and then I was like you know what if they're want to bail on me over this then [ __ ] them I don't want to be friends with those guys anyway and it felt amazing it felt so good to be able to talk about this with people and I've talked to a bunch of other people who have struggled with this and a common feature that people have when they're trying to break any type of addiction or a habit is they don't talk about it with people because they're embarrassed and I have found that talking about it it makes me not embarrassed because a lot of other people struggle with the stuff and it humanizes someone because I know that a lot of people listen to me and might look up to me it's cool to help them but I mostly do it for me it's a selfish reason why I talk about it because it makes me feel better and it makes me feel like it's no big deal or it kind of normalizes it and so in my opinion if you're trying to change a habit whether it's addiction whether trying to start a business I think that you should tell people and the reason you should tell people is because of lesson number three which is I think it's important to recreate your identity so Robert Green is one of my favorite authors he's got this awesome book called the 48 Laws of Power and I remember reading it when I was trying to get sober and I think it's like chapter 25 and he's got this chapter about recreating your identity and he WR wrote the book book in terms of like how to gain power which you could argue is or is not good it doesn't matter the lesson though was awesome for me and he gave examples of like celebrities for example Lady Gaga Lady Gaga was this like fairly like normal woman when she was like 18 years old and then she's like you know I'm kind of quirky I'm gonna lean into like this weird thing uh with my identity I'm GNA make my whole brand about it and she became that person and that is like the Lady Gaga character and I found that to be very empowering and so I started changing my language to not I'm G to get sober or I'm going to try and be sober or I'm going to try not to drink too I am sober I am an alcoholic and I found that labeling to be powerful I think a lot of people don't like to label themselves labels can be really bad for you if you do like I am depressed or I am weak or whatever it is and so I just changed the label that I gave myself and I found that that kind of was like the seed for recreating an identity so my identity before getting was like I've got a strong tolerance or I can be the life of the party or I just don't give a [ __ ] I'm down for whatever like these stupid labels that I gave myself I was still labeling myself so instead I decided I'm going to recreate my identity and I'm going to give myself the label of I am sober and I have other examples of doing this so for example um I'm going to talk about this in a second but after giving up drinking I totally got addicted to sugar and I got pretty like fat and at like two or three years ago I told Sean um I go Sean I'm now a fitness influencer and if you go to my Instagram you'll see all these old posts where I it was silly like I was I was kind of being silly about it but I was serious I'm like I am a fit person now I am an athlete and so I got super fit because I started working at it but I labeled myself and labeling myself as an athlete or as someone who works out every day I didn't want to ruin that label and so I exercised every single day and I think labeling yourself as a good person a loyal person as a business build uh Builder as a for as a force of nature as a fitness freak I think those labels are incredibly important because it makes sure that you recreate your identity and I likeed to tell people that and to this day I still do that with a bunch of things so for example if I need if I meet someone new I'm not gonna be like yeah I'm an alcoholic I've got issues but if they offer me uh a beverage or something a beer I just say no I don't drink because I like it too much and they get the message but I do like little subtle things like that where it's kind of puts my foot down of I do not drink alcohol and I I felt this load lighting from my shoulders to like put it out there but it put pressure on me to never break that because I didn't want to disappoint others and I didn't want to disappoint myself and so I like recreating my identity and I like using labels and I think it's really important so whether you want to start a business this is a business Channel we'll talk about business whether you want to start a business and you're working somewhere it's like oh I'm only working here temporarily but I'm actually uh building a company right now because I'm an entrepreneur I like labels I think labels are incredibly effective all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analyst and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actual able guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link down below in the description now back to the show lesson number four I'm not trying to be perfect I'm just trying to be mostly good and I think that that is true for many things and let me give you an example so I read so many books when I was trying to get sober uh I talked about the 48 Laws of Power that was a great one Mastery by Robert Green that was another good one and then the third one was The Power of Habit the takeaway for that book for me was that a habit does doesn't go away it just gets transferred and so what that means is that when you want to change a habit it's important to look at your Loop so usually it's a there's some type of uh stimulus that makes you want to do something and then you react to it and you typically do that over and over and over again um and that's how a habit is created and so what I had to do when I was giving up booze was I had to look at what my behavior was and I had to like break the pattern and the pattern wasn't necessarily going to go away it was just going to get transferred to something new and so when I transferred my Habit to something new I was under uh doctor supervision under the uh for this and I told the doctor I'm like man I'm trying to not drink and I'm on day three I am craving sugar so much because when you drink like I drink like 30 beers a day you're like craving carbs constantly because that's a big part of alcohol and the doctor was like just go and eat M&M's just eat M&M's all day just go like who cares just you can figure that out at a later date but right now the goal is not to be perfect and live a perfect life it's just to be better than you were and I thought that that was so relieving because I thought I had to be perfect as like no I'm making this massive life change I can't screw anything up and I was like No just improve this one thing and give into the sugar and then at a later date when you're confident with that the alcohol thing is is away and you're not craving it as much we'll address the sugar thing another time and so I did I drink uh or I ate tons of M&M that was my candy for a long time was peanut M&M's and I loved non-alcoholic beer I drink so much oduls uh I would drink like 15 to 20 ODS a day because I noticed when I craved beer I just went and gotten o and that's a non-alcoholic beer if you don't live in America it doesn't taste very good but it was an awesome uh replacement and I got pretty fat because of that but I was okay it was better to be fat and not on alcohol than whatever I was before but drink as much as I did and then I transferred that habit from non-alcoholic beer and sugar I've mostly have successfully transferred it to diet soda and carbonated drinks so I drink a ton of like carbonated water like all day uh and I love diet soda and diet soda you could say that's not good for you but that's okay I'm not trying to be perfect I'm just trying to be mostly good now lesson number five Being Sober attracts more people like I said before I was 23 24 25 when I went through this journey I was single at the time and what does every single guy care about meeting girls or meeting whatever you're into but basically meeting someone uh and my number one fear I remember this when I was trying to get sober was what girls think about me I didn't want them to think I was like a freak at the time I was like oh what do they think I'm a freak what do they think like are they gonna think that I'm like religious what if they which is nothing wrong with being religious but I ain't and I I was like are they going to be turned off are they like not going to be into me cuz I'm going to be boring and I remember my first sober day I was scared shitless I was so afraid and I decided to just tell her when we uh something it came up I don't remember how uh I think because I didn't order like a drink which she ordered a drink she's like oh you don't drink and I was like no like I'm basically an alcoholic and it's been like six months since I drank and I remember she leaned in like she like put her elbow on the table and like leaned in and I was like Bingo she's interested what the hell that and and I don't think you should do something like this for other people but at the time I was like I'll take any advantage that I can get and the fact that I was afraid to meet women and girls because I was an alcoholic and the and that their po it made her maybe like more interested in me I was like I'll take a lake up anywhere I can get it so I leaned into that and I noticed that women liked me more at least the right type of woman the type of woman I wanted to attract they liked me more because of that and uh I've been married now for a long time and so meeting girls is not in that way isn't actually something I care about anymore but men were attracted to me more too like because I had this newfound confidence it felt as if I was walking around all day and I remember I used to think I've got a string attached to my back and I would try to pull it up and so I would try to walk up like perfectly straight because I was like wow this whole drinking thing is changing my confidence I'm going to lean into other things that create a real sense of confidence so I started changing my posture and it was awesome and what happened was that created this cycle of confidence where I was like oh I could do this without beer I could do uh I can meet a girl I can go and start a business I could do all these things and it created this like crazy cycle of confidence I kept getting bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and it was the best feeling on Earth lesson number six finding inspiration is 100% worth it and helpful and it's okay to be corny so I remember when I was 24 I met this guy named Joe Garvey Joe Garvey actually had a kind of a interesting business it was called Clash it stood for like the California League of scavenger hunts or something like that and when I was trying to start my business I didn't have any income coming in and so I met Joe somehow through a friend of a friend and he was like man I host these scavenger hunts for companies they like pay me $10,000 and I do a scavenger hunt all over the city where you gota like go all over the city and find like certain things and it was a blast and he would let me work some of the scavenger hunts and he would pay me like $200 or something it was a big deal and at the end of a scavenger hunt you ended a bar and you drink and he would like be there being the life of the party he was this big uh he was a big tall guy and he was in the center like getting everyone to R up and do all these like team building stuff but it was like cool and but it always involved alcohol and I remember after working with him he told me I don't remember how but I was like Joe you don't drink he's like oh no like you know I had a problem I I don't drink anymore I'm sober and I was like you can do that while being the life of the party that's insane to me how do you do that and like he had a ton of friends and women loved him and I was like you're the man you're my hero I can't believe you just admitted that you had a drinking problem and yet you're still like the man people still like you and stuff and I got so much inspiration from that and it made me feel feel so good so I started reading all these inspirational books like the Tony Robbins of the world all that stuff I read it like crazy I even had this jar I had this jar where every day that I didn't drink I would put a penny in and then it was like every day that I exercised I put a penny in and then it turned into where I put three pennies in if I didn't drink if I exercised and I ate well I would put a penny in and I my goal was to fill this jar all the way up and I look back at that and I'm like yeah that was like maybe a little corny but it helped so much and like leaning into some of these like cheesy things it's really powerful and I know a bunch of because of this podcast and because of my work I know a bunch of like quote powerful people I know a bunch of billionaires people who like some sometimes many other people will look up to a lot of them do this corny [ __ ] because and I still do it by the way we do it because it inspiration is awesome I was already a motivated person I don't think you can make someone who's unmotivated motivated but I think you can Inspire them an inspiration is just having something to reach towards or it's reading something or being or consuming some type of content where it helps Point your your car in the right direction I always viewed myself I viewed myself as this like Fast Car whose back tires were lifted in the air and I was like had my foot on the gas and I was just flooring it but I wasn't going anywhere and that and that was like my motivation I was already a motivated person my wheels were moving quickly but I had to like let the tires on the ground and I had to be pointed in the right direction and that's what I use inspiration inspirational stuff for so I like a lot of these cheesy moves mov where it's like uh uh a guy doing something that's totally unrealistic but it makes me feel good or reading up the Tony Robbins books reading a lot of these books that I will definitely make fun of now which by the way I still read it made me feel so much better and gave me inspiration and I think it's important to like lean into that whether you're starting a business or whatever you're doing because dude it's scary like giving up alcohol starting a business meeting a girl trying to approach a woman who you who you who you like moving to a new place it's scary and you need every advantage that you can get in order to like get over that hump and to actually make these things uh become a reality and so like lean into some of that stuff there's a lot of like really good inspirational stuff um out there sometimes it's my first million in this podcast um but I think it's cool to like consume a lot of that information because that rubs on you and you need any advantage you can get in order to get ahead and to accomplish uh whatever it is you want to accomplish it's still like a little uncomfortable for me to talk about some of this stuff but I do it because it definitely makes me feel better and I acknowledge that I think it will make a lot of you guys feel better if you're trying to achieve anything whether it's giving up booze start a business do whatever um at the end of the day this is all about like getting over your fear I think it's it's about how to uh kind of jump off a cliff and um there's a reason I have this horrible tattoo I'm not going to show it right now but on my feet on my left and right feet I've got the word act and on the right foot I have now it's a homemade tattoo when I was getting sober I like used a needle and I like tattooed my feet because like I said I like inspirational stuff but I think that this podcast hopefully is a little bit of inspiration but also practical ways that I can get you guys to act now and to change what it whatever it is you want to change I'll be in the comments on YouTube whether you're listening to this on um YouTube or U um a podcast app but go to our YouTube page my first million and comment on this video and I'll try to reply to a bunch of them but if you are struggling with something say what it is you're struggling with and what you're going to do to approach it and get over it because I think it feels good to put that stuff on paper like I said it feels good to label yourself about what you what you are now versus what you were but let me know in the YouTube comments what you think about this and that's the pop [Music]

I think they're going to be a bunch of interesting voice services for everything from restaurants to HVAC companies to dental reception that are just like answer the phone I think that's one of the ideas we had and it could be informational like we are open from 800 am to 6 p.m um or a lead generation business where I'm like well like my Plumbing broke and like are you available tomorrow at 3M I'm a huge believer in this huge like this simple idea so you know like when the when the internet came out it was like um oh it's going to be so crazy but like one of the obvious things was like Hey every restaurant just kind of needs your menu online like you should put your you should put your restaurant exists where it's located and then put your menu up there even as a PDF that's still like value ad for you it's like it became where every business needed a website and now what I think it's gon to have is that every business needs an agent and so what's the agent for most small businesses so like I call pest control because we always get a bunch of like mice jumping in our pool for whatever reason and try calling Pest Control nobody ever picks up the damn phone and because there's us it's usually run by like it's like Mike's pest control and Mike's out in the field doing things all day controlling the P actually doing work and so he doesn't pick up the phone and so then you leave a message and you're like you and then you call 10 of them because you're not sure if Mike's gonna get back to you so then it becomes whoever gets back to you first Mike loses business because Mike doesn't pick up the phone Mike also is not going to hire somebody to just sit there and wait for the three phone calls a day that he's going to get it just wouldn't make sense but now you go and I built one of these in our like AI uh like weekly tutoring session that I have basically I was like I want to build one of these so we have the same problem for our our offshore recruiting business so we own a offshore recruiting business called somewhere it's like you can fire you can find amazing talent they're just somewhere out in the world you just have to find them so what somewhere does they find you Elite Talent now the big problem if you go to somewhere. comom it's like you say okay I'm looking for a designer or I need somebody who could do who get me leads for my marketing business or my real estate business or I need somebody to do a data entry right so you have all these jobs now the button on the site is basically like you want to start hiring fill out this form so you fill out the form and then it's like awesome we will get back to you soon or it's like schedule a call here's the call tomorrow or two days from now and no matter how many sales agents we have a call tomorrow is not as good as talk to me right now about what I need because right now is when I'm interested right now is when I'm on your website right now is when I'm not thinking about other variations of how I might solve this problem and you have an opportunity to sell me and so Sam I don't know if you've seen this but like check out bland. this is this is one I built on if the answer is have you seen this assume it's no and my mind is being blown by all this stuff but basically it lets you build a phone agent for yourself so I went on here and I built a phone agent so I built a guy who could answer the phone so that when somebody goes to somewhere and they want to they want to hire somebody it'll be like awesome what are you hiring for have you ever hired overseas and you're like yeah I have it's like cool um tell me what you're looking for in a couple you know a couple sentences oh great it sounds like what you're looking for is somebody who could be a developer for for your Shopify store our our noal budget for that is 2,000 a month would that work for you or are you looking for something a little bit more a little bit less and then it answers it it basically does the intake the initial sales call for you and it's like no problem we've hired this month for 85 other Shopify Brands who are looking for Shopify developers you're in good hands uh we do this all the time we will uh I'm going to start looking for candidates now I'm going to email you tomorrow with three candidates how does that sound and the person's like great I guess I can just like wait for that to happen or or it'll pull from our existing database and be like here's an example resume this is the type of person we'd be looking for would this person fit your needs yes or no so then the human salesperson will come into work and see a ticket that's like the AI agent did the initial sales call and found the customer's requirements and kind of already warmed the sale up and told the customer what they needed to know the things you repeat every time on the phone and now you could follow up with a more bespoke answer for that person that's the future that I see I I wasn't able to fully build that I did like a prototype of it but that's what I think websites even like ours which is an internet business should have which means that every plumbing and pest control and restaurant they're going to have their version of that this is 100% way better than having a call center or it might or it will be when it IT long so long it works as good but this is absolutely the way to go all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

there's a wonderful story about Peter teal when he was running paypals his Common Sense system was everybody in the company should figure out one priority not a to-do list but a single priority if anybody tried to talk to him about something that was not their big thing he would literally just leave the room he's like oh you're talking to me about that I thought your thing is this okay see you if you allow yourself to have more than one Focus you've already blinked it says you've determined that mediocrity is an acceptable outcome my singular Focus philosophy is that Solutions may not be clear but the path to Excellence and value are and the path to Excellence and value is to have a angular Focus

I have several friends who have shipped like AI companionship apps just look at paid apps in the app store by charting and some of those people are generating a million dollars of cash flow for themselves it's not because they're deep AI people when you say companion you mean like uh a digital girlfriend or boyfriend I think people think that is skewed toward girlfriend in a way that's not necessarily true you know you can have your own ethical points of view about like whether or not that's good for people but it's a pretty basic human need and guess what people want all sorts of different things in terms of n companionship and how you might distribute that aren't these quietly very huge like uh can we do some like uh ballpark you know give people a sense of the size and scale that these have gotten to so there's there's replica I think that's probably the most well-known one which is a digital boyfriend or girlfriend they kind of try to say friend but I think the use case is a little bit more in the uh in the relationship side of things and I don't I don't remember their exact numbers but I don't think I would be crazy for saying they're doing like 50 million a year in Revenue and I believe she had bootstrapped it for a while at least or raised very little money to get there is that right uh tell me if I'm off base I might be wrong on some of that yeah Eugene has built a very cash efficient business okay is that like a code for something are you an investor in r no I'm I'm not an investor you just said everything without saying a thing it was basically like your friends with her you know the number and they're killing it are are they killing it from your perspective I think they are making a lot more Revenue than most startups okay what are the other ones that are interesting so there's character AI that has like some absurd amount of traffic but I've also heard some things about like I don't know if this is all legit traffic or what but there's character AI what are the other ones that are interesting or what do you what do you who I want to touch on character for a second because I I think like the thing that is really interesting to me about character or the companion apps that work really well is like people spend hours with them how many products do you spend hours with every day not a lot like social media Sean that's like my product that I spend hours W yeah um you were at Greylock I think when they invested in Discord I I think the timing is there and Discord was one of those things that was probably Overlook because it was like mostly teenagers who play video games that were using this thing and it kind of looked like a chat room but you're like ah well how is it going to make money it's not like slack where you can charge the company but the stat was people were spending like seven hours a day or something on Discord something ridiculous like that just living in Discord it was their social life and so you're like well there's there's definitely something there and they were able to make a ton of money just even selling them at that point because if you have that much engagement you can't fake that yes by the way I just went to character Ai and there's an option to chat with Elon Musk and the the preloaded question why did you buy Twitter so I click it so it starts a chat with Elon Musk as a character and then it the first response literally goes you are wasting my time I literally rule the world okay so by the way on according to similar web which is like you multiply by two or three and then you divide by two or three and that's the huge range but according to similar web it says that character AI has 310 million monthly uniques are you kidding me I mean that's more than the Wall Street Journal it's more than like a bunch of really that's insane is this company really that big I think people want companions this is what I'm saying that the be the like engagement characteristics around this stuff is real and So for anybody like starting a new business you know oneperson company shipping AI companion up to a niche like generating a million dollars of cash flow for themselves like that's real do you know how these things grow so I mean 300 million monthly visits is no joke what is what's the growth channel for something like this well I think that's going to be like an advantage in the future I do think one of the weird things about these AI capabilities is they are so novel and unique that they do Drive Word of Mouth for example with character you can make new characters and people share them right so there's built virality there um but like maybe I'll give you like two other examples of just like when I say the capabilities are just really new and they're powerful and people want to talk about them like I don't think you can engineer that but it's just characteristic of these companies okay so one example is I am an investor in a company called haen you can make a video Avatar of yourself you cannot tell the difference and you know reaching that bar of quality is new as of this past year and like people create content that is unbelievable and they share it and so like like now haen is in tens of millions of Revenue great they've never spent a dollar on like paid marketing all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

there are like ways to make a million bucks and then ways to make a million bucks that could turn into a billion bucks right this is Sarah the queen of AI she's got a $100 million fund that she's investing into AI startups and we invited her on to brainstorm AI business ideas I mean I think the market for this company is very deep because people want a lot of video and so I think there's a billion dollars of video generation Revenue Sarah how hard is something like this to make people are generating a million dollars of cash loow for themselves it's not because they're deep AI people and it looks super real am I right what isn't this wild this is [Music] amazing so what do you mean by that you're saying there's ways to make a million bucks and then there's ways to make a million bucks that could turn into a billion bucks you have my interest let's go okay okay let's go so I I think maybe and I don't mean this in any dismissive way I think venture capitalist are very often accused of dismissing something as like a cash flow lifestyle business or whatever right or which by the way for anyone who is not in the VC world you go to a VC you say I've got this great company I think it can make five million in profit in year eight I then after that maybe we can grow this for another 50 years and one day it could be a thing and they say that's that's a really nice lifestyle business it's like them saying that's cute right I remember that's cute yeah I remember my first time doing that of course the thing is is that anyone who actually is an entrepreneur including anyone who's a VC they know that you can oftentimes get richer and have a less stressful life if you have a quote lifestyle business yeah so I I'd say like there's many type of valid businesses right and then also a lot of things that have become very interesting start very small so I I want to recognize that but I think a reasonable analogy is if you can figure out internet distribution and then get you know super powerful models getting increasingly powerful to just do something useful in a niche those two things together that's like the new Drop Shipping you know how like for maybe seven or eight years I'm like too old to know what the exact timeline was but there's a period of time where people are like oh you know I'm an internet kid I'm gonna figure out some Drop Shipping thing and like make my first $100,000 I think this is it yes so so basically for people who don't don't really know you could go on Alibaba or AliExpress that was like the open AI in this case right so it was like this thing exists that you didn't have to build but it's magic watch this you can push a button you never had to make the product you never had to Warehouse the product you never have to ship the product it will just magically appear at your customer's door you know somewhere between one and 3 weeks later um all you have to do is the marketing bit and kind of what you're saying is open Ai and the other AI companies have built this magic that basically will take a piece of text and turn it into a video or a song or whatever and if you just do the marketing bit you can actually almost like drop ship a product or a service to the to the customer without having to make it yourself is that the idea that that is uh thanks for explaining it and I I think I think it's like easy with easier with a few examples right like copy editing is probably a prototypical one right you can do not amazing but like reasonable copy generation with these models today and so there's series of companies where you just have some templates that make it more obvious to somebody writing marketing copy how to use these models and then you have a website with decent SEO and then like you add some stripe integration and you're in business what's an example well I I think like copy Ai and Jasper these companies started this way right right and and then I have several friends who have shipped like AI companionship apps just look at you know paid apps in the app store by charting and you know some of those people are generating a million dollars of cash flow for themselves it's not because they're deep AI people when you say companion you mean like uh a digital girlfriend or boyfriend right I think people think that is skewed toward girlfriend in a way that's not necessarily true but if you and you know you can have your own ethical points of about like whether or not that's good for people but it's a pretty basic human need and guess what people want all sorts of different things in terms of Niche companionship and how you might distribute that aren't these quietly very huge like uh can we do some like uh ballpark you know give people a sense of the size and scale that these have gotten to so there's there's replica I think that's probably the most well-known one which is a digital boyfriend or girlfriend they kind of try to say friend but I think the use case is a little bit more in the uh in the relationship ship side of things and I don't I don't remember their exact numbers but I don't think I would be crazy for saying they're doing like 50 million a year in revenue and I believe she had bootstrapped it for a while at least or raised very little money to get there is that right uh tell me if I'm off base I might be wrong on some of that yeah eugenia's built a very cash efficient business okay is that like a code for something are you an investor in rep no I'm I'm not an investor you just said everything without saying a thing it was basically like your friends with there you know the number and they're killing it are are they killing it from your perspective I think they are making a lot more Revenue than most startups um I I don't think it's fair for me to give the number it's not my number right okay what are the other ones that are interesting so there's character AI that has like some absurd amount of traffic but I've also heard some things about like I don't know if this is all legit traffic or what but there's character AI what are the other ones that are interesting or what do you what do you who want touch on character for a second because I I think like you know when you look at consumer companies one of the things that I learned was that the behavior patterns like when something just really really stands out from all other products in their category or previous categories that's when you pay attention it's like the you know dumbest metric but it is really clear when something has special consumer Behavior around and the thing that is really interesting to me about character or the companion apps that work really well is like people spend hours with them right like you know in terms of the number of products like how many products do you spend hours with every day not a lot like social media Sean that's like my product that I spend hours a day with yeah um you were at graylock I think when they invested in Discord I think the timing is there and Discord was one of those things that was probably overlooked because it was like you know mostly teenagers who play video games that were using this thing and it kind

something on Discord something ridiculous like that just living in Discord it was their social life and so you're like well there's there's definitely something there and they were able to make a ton of money just even selling emojis at that point because if you have that much engagement you can't fake that yes by the way I just went to character Ai and there's an option to chat with Elon Musk and the the preloaded question why did you buy Twitter so I click it so it starts a chat with Elon Musk as a character and then it the first response literally goes you are wasting my time I literally ruled the world okay so by the way on according to similar web which is like you multiply by two or three and then you divide by two or three and that's the huge range but according to similar web it

of quality is new as of this past year and like people create content that is unbelievable and they share it and so like now hajen is in tens of millions of Revenue great they've never spent a dollar on like paid marketing Sam have you seen this thing before by the way hen this is one of those products that I'm seeing all over the place but it felt like it was just like people younger than me talking about it so I felt embarrassed well this is not like like the character AI was like you know that's like teenagers kind of sharing stuff it's more like whatpad or something this is a corporate use case so this is basically using like I make a digital AI of me or of a or or just like a fake character all together and then it could be used in training videos it can be used in intro videos with customers things like that so you could basically create a you don't have to actually set up a camera film a video have it edited and then post it in order to send a video to a prospect or send a video internally uh to in in a training system or educational product and so that's what this is and that's why they it just it says the top raise 60 million in funding but I think the the the chart I saw was pretty absurd that you know they basically raised a 20 million in ARR very very fast holy crap some of the usage actually also is yes it's a business use case but it's like all kinds of businesses like creators smbs like high-end Enterprise advertisers and so like for you guys to be like okay well like actually I bet there's a lot more demand for Sean and Sam talking than the amount I'm sure you hang out on the pot a lot but like then even each of you can contrib and so if the marginal cost of more time of Sam talking is free like you probably do more with it right I think that's just what people are discovering have you guys used this is it the landing page makes it look amazing like used it is it amazing or is it still up and coming no it's like pretty good this this C this one crosses the line I would say of usable in real real life versus cool demo which is the hard thing with AI you get a lot of cool demos then you go in and you try to use it for your use case and you're like how how come the Tweet had such a good output but mine is kind of whack every single time or like well this is good but it won't let me change the text on it which is what I would need to use it in my my real thing I would say this one is is definitely production ready they wouldn't have you know tens of millions in Revenue if they weren't actually usable by customers W well they just did like a public campaign with McDonald's right like an advertising but there's some good limits right like you can't be like moving around it's like a face on camera or at least that's what it used to be when I tried it like six months ago yeah there's some new stuff you should try like you know you you can be walking around now right oh wow okay I stand corrected all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spot upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show all right 're back uh can they just can we just upload our YouTube page or do we have to stand in front of it and film you have to stand in front of your web or phone camera for two minutes and film and it's more of a safety thing than anything else because they don't want people being able to take your YouTube and make you if that makes sense like they want they want you saying specific words about like i s par say it's okay to make this Avatar and you said that you started the podcast by saying there's like a lot of you had a really the line you said was awesome which is like there's a bunch of ways to make a million dollars that could eventually become a billion is this one of those companies where it started that way uh I think I mean I think the market for this company is very deep because people like they want a lot of video and I think more like if you just think about the domain of making video you guys know much more about this than me but like people want a lot of control right they want quality they want specific expression and brand and motions and they want like one person two people three people like person walking around product whatever it is and so I think there's actually a lot like there's a lot we still cannot do with research and the company wants to continually pull like push the bounds of what you can do and so I think this is a good example of like I think there's a billion dollars of video generation revenue for them or for others but like you know you you actually have to invest in the product pretty deeply but it doesn't mean that your wedge can't be really powerful across a single use case Sam have you seen the ones that do this for D Toc products the AI for D Toc product ads so go to icon. me if you scroll down you can watch the video so see the video of the Asian dude who's holding like a collagen peptides thing so that's a AI generated video it's the product in his hand that's not actually in his hand with a script that was written he never recorded it and now you have a ugc very authentic looking ad for an influencer you go to the next one look he's holding a different product that's because he didn't re-shoot it they just put a different product in his hand and it looks super [ __ ] real am I right what isn't this wild this is amazing and so he's got another one with Ramen and so what he's doing is interesting what he's doing is he's letting actual so these are not AI generary people this is a real person this is like an Instagram guy who's got like whatever hundreds of thousands of followers so he's letting popular Instagram people say hm okay I'll do it I'll create my my digital twin that will be able to do my brand like branded content so a brand can come in request from a let's say an instagrammer with a million followers and say I want you to sponsor this video here's the script here's my product and if I click yes then it will AI generate that video I never needed to like open up a package grab a thing you know take 10 20 minutes set up my tripod record an ad send it to the brand ask them if it's okay then they say yes and then I get paid instead of this case it's basically like I just approve the brand it uses my digital twin to make the ad if I'm cool with the ad I get paid and that's it and so that's what he's doing arcades is the same thing if you go to arcades it's like pretty [ __ ] wild and it's in their case these are fake actors so these women that you see on the thing that are like promoting stuff these people do not exist this is an AI generated woman who looks like a real person that is promoting some product and you script it and you can you know get these made I these are the or or it might be like a real person but they've said like license to the company you can do whatever you want with it yeah exactly uh but I think in this case they they might have started with a couple of those like I think they found one of the girls from this like on Fiverr or something um but the idea would be I don't know too much about the under under the hood stuff of these I just started playing with them but the idea would be that you know people are not going to know what the hell's real and what's not this these look like real people in their home giving a genuine endorsement of some product that they like and it is very simple to create I think Sarah this is the type of idea you're talking about where two people can kind of take the existing models you know maybe customize them uh here but then it's just in a wedge in this case it's for e-commerce companies and they're going to try to build a business here that will do it'll be these both these business very quick to get to you know mid seven figures of Revenue uh Without You Know Much marketing spend or much of anything just because the product is such a wow product and then you know from there who knows if it can get you know really enormous or or not yeah and I think a piece of it is just like for for me like okay what's the difference between like the first million and the next 999 million it is whether or not the capability exists in the company to make the product deeper and keep expanding scope for what you do for your customer right and but there's a ton of these wedges so staying with visual content uh you can use this category of models they're open source to be fine-tuned for different use cases that are super commercial right so it could be models or creator videos for Ecom as you described it could be renderings for like interior design or buildings I don't know if you guys have ever looked at a floor plan like maybe I just have terrible visual spatial reasoning but I can't look at a floor plan with like a couple blocks and then like a fuzzy piece of fabric and be like yes I see it that is the room I'll put my life savings into this and our friend Peter level has a thing where you take a picture of your home and then it does interior design for you and shows you mockups which is pretty cool yeah but but I'd say like those you know those renderings Ally generated cost like thousands of dollars right and now if you can give it to people for very little incremental costs like that's an interesting wedge like there's a handful of um AI headshot companies making Revenue if you guys have ever gotten like a a professional head shot taken yeah dude I so this actually this is like kind of actually an interesting version of the Drop Shipping idea so these are this is I bet you this would work so there was an ad I saw on Facebook I think it was a Facebook ad and it basically was a guy and he had a head shot I think of somebody who I re recogniz maybe it was a VC in Sil Valley basically like if you're in San Francisco I take awesome head shots for you you you should have a great shot for your website for your LinkedIn whatever it's good for business good for your career and you click his site and it's a bunch of people in the tech industry and it was like $300 or $400 and I went to some Warehouse type of place in some some little like photo shoot studio in San Francisco stood there awkwardly got like head shot made and paid this guy you know 350 bucks and he was running Facebook ads profitably to do that so he was able to put in and acquiring a customer for whatever 70 bucks and he's generating 350 bucks off them and now you could run that same funnel just without the San Francisco studio and without the guy taking the picture and without any of the cost right like you just say awesome give me a couple of your photos and then boom here you go and I've seen a couple these go viral of like viral headshot viral yearbook ideas but I haven't seen too many people just like running paid on them and making them work but I'm pretty sure that you could create a paid funnel that would print cash for a period of time and maybe not forever but an arbit period of time yeah but what's what's an ex like so I've seen the same ones where it's like you look like a 80s Glam shot model remember I think the the professional one people are willing to pay more right so if it's if it's actually going to be for your what's an example of one yeah like look at this um look at this company Aragon doai oh dude look at this landing page this is genius they just have a sidescrolling Carousel and it's the befores and then there's a line and then they just that same photo becomes the after that is very well done looks good uh Sarah how hard is something like this to make so like there are a million of these wedges right and I think that means like it's an amazing time to as you were saying like be good at distribution understand like how to make a funnel and how to Market something and like to be an idea person right fundamentally like if you run into problems all the time you like see the right basic capabilities you're like oh I can think like you guys are both like oh I can think of like five other use cases for this right and by the way you know the distribution thing so this good example the so I invested a little bit in Jasper and Jasper was started by guys who were internet marketers first not AI researchers not AI you know Engineers not not even frankly very good Engineers probably they were just like internet guys internet internet business guys and they were I think they were doing something before this that wasn't really working very well but they had spent a lot of time building like internet marketing funnels and so when they got access to probably chat gpt3 or something like that they they were kind of back before or sorry before chat GPT just when it was gpt3 they got access to the API and they built Jasper which was a took that same capability but now made it useful for marketers so if you're a marketer you needed a blog post written or an email or you needed um you know copy written for an ad whatever it was they just made a standalone tool that would do that under the hood it's you know the open AI model is doing 80 90% of the work they maybe customized the last Last Mile of it but they were so good at internet marketing that they started running Facebook ads on this thing and it's the fastest company I've ever seen get to 50 million in AR they got to 50 million AR in in one year which is to go from zero to 50 million in Revenue in one year is just absurd and the way the reason they were able to do that is because their background as Internet marketers as guys who are like as soon as I have anything that works I will just plow the maximum amount of cash into Facebook ads as I can and I will just keep optimizing the ads until I get this thing you know a dollar in equals a $150 out or a dollar in equals $2 out and that's why they were able to be so successful early on because they had a different skill set than most of the Silicon Valley people most people in Silicon Valley don't ever run pay ads that's just like a pretty crazy thing I think like if we just go to the difference then like the challenge for any one of these companies that gets this wedge and like is rare to see Z to 50 in one year that's pretty special but even if you get like a product to hit in terms of initial adoption then I think the like the the next 999 million of Revenue has to be like I think more traditional not um uh because the problem is if it was I'm not saying the distribution piece was easy but let's say you were just first with an idea uh and like you hit it on Reddit because it's a novel capability uh like I think then you need need to get to traditional like reasons companies get really big product velocity depth of product ability to serve the customer social engagement or something right so like if you think about companions um uh it could be like what are the Arguments for like why somebody gets to dominate that that business um there's a version of a companion business or any business with paid spend and you know this really well that is like just a treadmill right like I make money but I have to keep putting money in it's the opposite of compounding um and if I like stop working hard or other people compete with me like the tribal get steeper or I fall off and and I I think one simple answer is on companions did you guys ever play The Sims growing up of course sure like it's very hard for me to not imagine the Sims better if the characters are like smarter and like richer in interaction and have like what looks like realistic video and voice um and so like technically instead of it just being like I'm talking to a person it could be you know that person has some combination of memory of me other interactions goals and like the media experience of them is richer and we haven't gone there yet but I think like there's a version of that company that's somewhere between like a companion and a game world that will be very big it's kind of an interesting exercise well if I could just get to a million then I've increased my likelihood and then maybe I can get that to 10 and then a 100 and then a billion I actually firmly believe that if if something can scale to 10 million there it may take a while but if it can get to 10 it can almost always get to 100 like there's enough people in the world to to make that work but it's actually an interesting exercise to think of all the things that you need to do in order to make those jumps now getting it to a billion I've actually that's been that's been hard for me to figure out how to do that but uh that's a fun exercise to think well if I can just get to a million I bet you I can get to 10 and if I get to 10 I know for a fact I can get to a 100 yeah by the way the Sims lifetime sales5 billion so uh without AI The Sims was able to get to five billion in sales if you made it more engaging by by AI powering all those characters that's going to be even stickier it's going to be a big business right um hey Sarah why dude you're like pretty in the not [ __ ] this fun thing like why don't you just go do this this sounds go make one this sounds way more fun than investing in it um I get to I like really like doing the zero to one thing repeatedly right and and so I think you just have to figure out what you're motivated by I uh am really motivated by working with people that are entrepreneurs that I like and respect and I think are super special and I do not like working with people that um that I don't have as much enthusiasm about right that's like a very specific personality trait and like law of large numbers as soon as you manage very large teams not everybody is going to be at the same level um and so like doing investing like and making being able to contribute to other people being successful that are really special and then the competitive nature of be right with skin in the game and then know what is happening like I like all of that but I you know Never Say Never I think we we incubate companies where like it's essentially like oh I see it I see it I see it and then there's frustration that like the right you know a set of people you're really excited to back just hasn't come together around a certain idea Sean you are more technical than me but you're still not technical I would say but you're more than me uh but s Park classic compliment thank you very much you're not Tech you're more technical than me but you're not technical but you're also not technical you're almost goodlook yeah yeah yeah you're hotter than me but I'm a one you're a three uh did you uh when you I know you've been like studying this stuff when you like this seems like a really fun weekend thing just to to play with are these actually would it be really hard for me to learn how to do this would it be hard to build one of these just like a really simple project because I I now she's Sarah's getting me all hyped on this [ __ ] I'm like this looks really fun to to mess around with yeah I me think it's like anything else you gota you'd have to have a partner to speed you up like you learning to to code to be able to to do these things would be the slow way of doing it versus the easy way is you find an engineer who's excited about this and doesn't have Clarity of vision around it maybe doesn't have a doesn't want to run the business side of things and you say great hey let's let's build X together I have a clear idea that X will work and I'll handle the marketing side you got to make this product do do this and um that's not so hard that's that's pretty easy this is exciting uh you get to see a lot of cool [ __ ] let's um let's do some of your like specific kind of thesis so you have this website conviction. good website by the way how'd you get that domain I'm an internet person yeah okay all right did you see her website she has a website for her uh I think it's the incubator where you got to like code in order to get access it you don't really code but like the menu is set up like that it's a little it's yeah it's a little CLI typ what's what's that URL um I think it was called commit it was like our program for like hackathons college students Etc yeah it's commit. conviction. comom Sean it's a pretty cool website actually oh you open up it's a terminal yeah oh God uh let me see let me try to do this so run no try to break job D HTML got to type in help so if you type in help it like gives you the menu anyway slash is like a folder I don't know I don't know how to do this um all right so you have a website with a bunch of basically like requests for startups or you know things that you think are gonna going to be built in in uh in AI so let's run through some of these because I that's actually why I initially was like we got to have her on the to to kind of um to talk some of these out so let's do one that's you call your personal seller do you remember this you might have wrote this a while while back but your your personal seller it might have been one like my partner PR of reedy's or something but we can certainly talk about it yeah okay I I'll give you the summary so the summary is uh your personal seller I think the idea here is that there's a bunch of places online to sell stuff Etsy and eBay and Amazon a bunch of different places to sell things um but actually like doing that is a bunch of work like creating the store listings changing prices writing the copy all of that and I think what you're saying is somebody should be able to just like have a product and then the AI should be able to like do the actual Ecom management of the of the sell of of the of setting up the shop and running it is that what that means yeah I think like um it's probably it it matches like a larger theme that I really think is exciting about AI which is like because all of these skills and it could be um run a basic like social marketing campaign right or like send email to your customers that are likely to be repeat customers or improve your website for indexing like there are a bunch of things that um are probably not related to let's say it's a let's say it's a Shopify Drop Shipping Store for like a particular type of sock and you love socks as an entrepreneur it's not like related to the merchandising decision or the design decision like what is the sock I want to give the world right and like that's kind of the essence of like why like sometimes people become entrepreneurs and so can you can you take a bunch of these tasks that require skills in all these different domains and just automate them uh at least at a basic level like I think you can now right and I think like that there the platforms um Shopify and and square Etc they're they like you know they now have native assistant products that help you use the platforms better but I I think across the spectrum of how to be a good internet entrepreneur like in the e-commerce sense I think there's more opportunity there um how do companies do that now so let's just say you're a company with 10,000 SKS um how do you get accurate descriptions for all of them well usually if you have 10,000 SKS you have like it's a you have like you don't have 10,000 unique uh totally variant color VAR size variant things like that so like I'll give you I'll tell you an our case right so I have an Ecom store and we have we spend uh let's see probably like five or six grand a month on just Shopify Plus or whatever like the pre the Enterprise Shopify thing that's just the Shopify cost on top of that I would say we probably have another um three to five grand a month on Shopify apps so you need an app for search you need an app for uh bundles you need an app for this that there's like a ton of things that shopy doesn't provide so my all-in just software cost is at least 10 grand a month probably a little bit more on top of the fees they take of every transaction then I have an e-commerce store manager his job is just to like run the store like we have new products coming up make sure those launches go well move things around oh this is broken there's a bug whatever we then have a merchandiser the merchandiser goes every day looks at the collections and says this thing is sold out it shouldn't be at the top anymore we don't have sizes for this or we don't have colors for this so let me move this other thing to the top or hey the season just ended these need to be rearranged so there's a human being that does that there's also apps that do that but you kind of need the app plus the software today because the apps not quite good enough to do it by itself we then have vas that go in and they do all the product pages the descriptions the templates the tagging so that our inventory data is correct because we need to be able to analyze our inventory to do that you need to tag every product accurately so there is like four or five people that are just making sure the store runs in addition to five apps that make the store run that all today is shouldn't be the Le like future state of things that's just the current state of things and and Sean I think the future state is for entrepreneurs who cannot recruit manage pay the five people it takes to run your store like what do they do as Sam said like I think it will be easier in the future right yeah I think this is also kind of like similar as an idea to all of the another area that we are and I'm like personally really interested in is um The Voice automation Market I think like a lot of your listeners will have seen the GPT 40 demo where it's like a voice that may or may not sound like scarjo talking like in real time well we played with 11 Labs no but that that's dubbing she's talking about just being able to like Alexa you just talk to it and um it just talks back and it sound like scet Johanson just like chat GPT but you don't have to type yeah both of these things either like it could be in your voice or like some spokesperson for a brand or a company but like the ability to give reasoned you know knowledge-based responses in a human voice I think it's just really powerful right and I don't think people are thinking enough about the opportunities here where you mentioned 11 there's like exactly one independent voice API business and tens of millions of Revenue and that's 11 they're great that's amazing um I think there are other opportunities so like there's a company called caria that does like more realtime voice for example you think 11 is by the way 11 labs think they're at tens of millions in Revenue uh they are they're definitely at you know a a large number that is in the tens of millions of Revenue hope I'm not surprising surprising a market with that but you know a lot of developers will immediately gravitate like toward API business but that is not how the rest like the world is full of niches and people running businesses that don't think about apis and won't use them right and so like just to just like you know your personal seller um I think they're going to be a bunch of interesting voice service is for everything from restaurants to HVAC companies to dental reception that are just like answer the phone I think that's one of the ideas we had and it could be informational like we are open from 8:00 am to 6:00 pm um or a lead generation business where I'm like well like my Plumbing broke and like are you available tomorrow at 3M but it's much huge believer in this huge like and what Sean this this simple idea so you know like when the when the internet came out it was like um oh it's going to be so crazy but like one of the obvious things was like Hey every restaurant just kind of needs their menu online like you should put your you should put your restaurant exists where it's located and then put your menu up there even as a PDF that's still like value ad for you it's like it became where every business needed a website and now what I think it's gonna have is that every business needs an agent and so what's the agent for most small businesses so like I called pest control because we always get a a bunch of like mice jumping in our pool for whatever reason and try calling Pest Control nobody ever picks up the damn phone and because there's us it's usually run by like it's like Mike's pest control and Mike's out in the field doing things all day controlling the pest actually doing work and so he doesn't pick up the phone and so then you leave a message and you're like you and then you call 10 of them because you're not sure if Mike's gonna get back to you so then it becomes whoever gets back to you first Mike loses business because Mike doesn't pick up the phone Mike also is not going to hire somebody to just sit there and wait for the three phone calls a day that he's gonna get it just wouldn't make sense but now you go and I built one of these in our like AI uh like weekly tutoring session that I have basically I was like I want to build one of these so we have the same problem for our our offshore recruiting business so we own a offshore recruiting business called somewhere it's like you can fire you can find amazing talent they're just somewhere out in the world you just have to find them so what somewhere does they find you Elite Talent now the big problem if you go to some.com it's like you say okay I'm looking for a designer or I need somebody who could do who get me leads for my marketing business or my real estate business or I need somebody to do a data entry right so you have all these jobs now the button on the site is basically like you want to start hiring fill out this form so you fill out the form and then it's like awesome we will get back to you soon or it's like schedule a call here's the call tomorrow or two days from now and no matter how many sales agents we have a call tomorrow is not as good as talk to me right now about what I need because right now is when I'm interested right now is when I'm on your website right now is when I'm not thinking about other variations of how I might solve this problem and you have an opportunity to sell me and so Sam I don't know if you've seen this but like check out bland. this is this is one I built on if the answer is have you seen this assume it's no and my mind is being blown by all this stuff but basically it lets you build a phone agent for yourself so I went on here and I built a phone agent so I built a guy who could answer the phone so that when somebody goes to somewhere and they want to they want to hire somebody it'll be like awesome what are you hiring for have you ever hired overseas and you're like yeah I have it's like cool um tell me what you're looking for in a couple you know a couple sentences oh great it sounds like what you're looking for is somebody who could be a developer for your Shopify store our our noal budget for that is 2,000 a month would that work for you or are you looking for something a little bit more a little bit less and then it answers it it basically does the intake the initial sales call for you and it's like no problem we've hired this month for 85 other Shopify Brands who are looking for Shopify developers you're in good hands uh we do this all the time we will uh I'm going to start looking for candidates now I'm going to email you tomorrow with three candidates how does that sound and the person's like great I guess I can just like wait for that to happen or it or it'll pull from our existing database and be like here's an example resume this is the type of person we'd be looking for would this person fit your needs yes or no so then the human salesperson will come into work and see a ticket that's like the AI agent did the Anissa sales call and found the customer's requirements and kind of already warmed the sale up and told the customer what they needed to know the things you repeat every time on the phone and now you could follow up with a more bespoke answer for that person that's the future that I see I I wasn't able to fully build that I did like a prototype of it but that's what I think websites even like ours which is an internet business should have which means that every plumbing and pest control and restaurant they're going to have their version of that this is 100% way better than having a call center or it might or it will be when it as long so long as it works as good but this is absolutely the way to go all right let's do some more so you have another one on here that's I think an easy one that's cool NextGen auto complete and I think the idea here is you do a Chrome extension or a browser extension that not just like autocomplete helps you fill in the next word it thinks you're going to say or how to spell a word but what you have here is that it starts to learn your voice so it can write your it can help you write your emails or your blog posts in your voice which is kind of like the next level up from autocomplete next level up from gramarly it doesn't just kind of correct or spell check your stuff but it actually writes the way you write because it has watched the way you write is that the thesis here yeah yeah absolutely and I think it can be you know lots of different types of of business communication but especially like email so I don't know this is this is actually um my friend Mike Vern's idea I think he suffers from the same thing I do that might be true for you which is like I'm an incredibly picky writer and so I will use the models today for generation of basic content or I'll ask my amazing EA to like draft emails for me and then I will go rewrite the whole thing because I don't like the tone because it doesn't sound like me or because it's not tight enough or because I want to use a certain phrase and I think the next level of like value and impact is definitely going to be um fine-tuning to specific voice and nobody wants to write like chap GPT like nobody wants to be the generic AI either so what everybody wants is the thing in between this shit's all wild to me is there anyone right now doing that that you like because I would like to use this today uh I mean superhuman has like really interesting AI features but I think the the unlock is going to be the personalization and what's your overarching in thesis so you have this thing called software 3.0 which by the way most VC thing to do to be like oh software 3.0 web 3.0 you you've done it you you you've gone full VC what is software 3.0 yeah okay so the seed for that phrase software 3.0 it comes from actually an essay that Andre karpathy wrote years ago about software 2.0 and the base premise here is that like you had to write uh a lot of software by hand in a prior generation before machine learning and then software 2.0 Andre you know worked at Tesla was working on autopilot was really about data set labeling right you you you are teaching a machine learning model by the data you choose to put into the pipeline um how to do new tasks software 3.0 is the idea that the next generation of software a lot of it is about manipulating Foundation models and they're called Foundation models because they have a lot of capability out of the box you don't need to train them from scratch you just need to give them like guidance reinforcement the information specific to your business and so an example would be like Shawn was talking about for his lead capture intake form voice like he doesn't need to go train a model he doesn't need to go like collect data for that software application like the voice agent is a software application he just needs to like make sure it's plugged into his schedule system and his database of candidates and be able to retrieve the right information about the business and like you know respond consistently to customers in a certain tone right and so that's more about like manipulating a bunch of this base work that people um like Labs have already done for you and the premise here is like that last mile of getting a foundation model to be like something that serves all these use cases in the real world that you know maybe the research labs think of as niches like the world is composed of very large niches and so I think it's a I think it's a really big opportunity for entrepreneurs and for us what are some of your like hot takes uh or maybe your contrarian takes anything that you think that might be counter to what the most people say most people do most people are betting on do you have anything that is against the grain you know I'm gonna get I'm going to give like a somewhat arrogant answer which is I don't spend a lot of time trying to figure out what the entire Market thinks actually so I'm like I don't know which of these things are contrarian I can tell you where like my opinion has changed dramatically like let me give you one example for many years in including you know the tenure of my investing at Greylock I was one of several people who were like okay we're gonna go understand Healthcare and digital health and I was like ah healthc care sucks right it's a quarter of the economy it's really important how could you not want to work on this Mission but it is so slow and the incentives are so screwed up that like trying to enter that market with technology or the speed of Entrepreneurship that you know silcon Valley entrepreneurs are seeking is like not a good idea and we just did a a healthcare administration automation company so I'm like oops like changed my mind real hypocrite here and like one of the reasons being I'm like well if you think about the Mind numbing work that happens in healthcare administration like billing authorization coding claims processing like all like even not even mind numbing but just like expensive and manual like patient support it's actually really fertile for an AI company and you know we back something that's like growing really quickly in one of those domains right and so I just say like I I guess I've changed my point of view on Healthcare I went to the pediatrician yesterday my doctor is with my baby there and I'm sitting there and she's got her iPad uh on like a table and there's a video like there and I'm like who the [ __ ] is that guy and they're like oh that's just like my scribe I uh he's just listening in and he's and he's taking notes but she was like I used to stay up until 3:00 a.m. taking notes on all of my patience oh wow they just do it for me and obviously the wheels are turning in my head I'm like yeah that that job is going to be unnecessary in a few years but it was amazing to have a medical scribe I've never seen such a thing and she's like oh this has been around for a long time I was like I've never seen that yeah I do think one framework for like your listeners like thinking about different ideas is like what parts of work have been outsourced Services already right because like it used to be the doctor taking the notes and they're like wow we pay this person a lot and like they should see more patients and think about their patients more like let us Outsource that to a cheaper Tech in our office let us like Outsource that Tech to India or the Philippines and now there are a number of scribe businesses in um medicine that are growing really fast like a bridge nabla freed like it is happening and so I think that will happen in a bunch of different areas where like basically if you can create separation of that work already to Outsource it then maybe you can Outsource it to a machine as well yeah Sam mman had a good thing he was like everybody worries about AI taking your job you but that's not the right way to think about it it's AI will take your tasks uh like you have to think about it not at a job level but at a task level there are certain tasks it can do really well there's certain tasks it can't do really well there's certain tasks today it can't do that in the future it can do and So eventually a job becomes a bundle of tasks um but but for now it's you can't think of the whole bundle because it can't replace the whole job but it can replace specific tasks which might be just the way it works in the long run is that there's a huge slew of tasks that can be that can be done by Ai and then there's people that bundle those tasks together to make sure that they're getting done well or at the right time I think that's like approximately right but to be intellectually honest like that there was a scribe in that outsourced BP that had that job and so it's not taking the doctor's job but it's taking the piece of the job like the doctor's job that already got separated out the task that they they didn't like but that became a job of its own yeah Tas became a job and the job goes back to being a task basically in this case yes yeah yeah it's a good framework Sarah are you are you investing exclusively in AI related businesses I am a technology investor I'm not a machine learning researcher I've been working on this stuff for a handful of years and I really believe it I think it's like the most important thing to happen in technology in a long time but I'd say like I'm also here to just you know invest in great tech companies and so you're also here to get paid I am also here to work on things that will work that are important right um and so like if a if an entrepreneur that I think Super highly of or like that I've worked with before or whatever comes to me and says like I have a great idea nothing to do with AI I'm still definitely going to be really interested in that if you ask me like what are the ideas that we think about or we hunting it is all in AI I do want to put one more thing out there which is definitely not a idea that just anyone can go after it's kind of the opposite of the like easy wedge idea in terms of how can I put distribution around like one functionality for a niche on a on a model like a AI um headshot application or something but I do really want to hear from anyone who has a point of view on what happens to the like Nvidia compute Monopoly and overall what's changing in the data center I don't know if this is a hot take to your former question but like I think a lot of people intellect in technology really the intellectually like are like oh yes of course workloads are changing from not AI to AI but they don't actually think about like what that means in terms of scale and market cap like that means like chips memory bandwidth networking energy storage optimized system design like that was a lot of technology company market cap before and so like if that's true there's going to be a bunch of different like new specialized Solutions and it's trillions of dollars of value at stake and it's not just like single direct attack on Nvidia that is like the opportunity what what else would be in that category if it's not just like hey our chip is better than Nvidia chip what what else is what's what's another shape of a company that could be in that that space so I I guess an example would be like well what are other bottlenecks like memory bandwidth what like what if you designed storage to be specific for AI data centers what if you like you could do cooling systems for like there are if you just reimagine the entire Data Center around like big AI inference I think you end up with like totally different needs the uh the New York Times had this article the other day and I don't remember the stat entirely but it was something like the amount of AI capacity or and chips like currently created right now we need to create like another like four trillion dollars in market cap in order to satisfy like the amount of capacity that we have and they were sort of writing it in a in a way of like I don't know we're going to be able to do that but then when you think about it the other way around where you where you think about well in 1998 if you said like you know what how big is the internet going to be uh I'm sure it went far beyond virtually 100% of the expert's opinion as to how big it will get and I remember reading this article the other day and I was like that's just absolutely astounding that we're in one of these moment seoa seoa came out with a a sort of blog post or I don't know PDF or something like that about this the I think they called it the $600 billion dollar hole or something it was basically saying well we've we've invested this much or we're investing this much in capex so if you invest that much in capex what do you need to get out to make that you know return and know that's a VC saying that which is which is not just like some journalist who doesn't get it who doesn't get Tech uh Sarah what was your reaction to that what's your take on that I think it is a lot of capex I think if you put it in context of like how does it compare to other big capex spens in the past let's say like the broadband buildout like well we wanted the internet you know like we spent about2 trillion do on broadband to date like we're not there yet right that was worth it and so what I would say is yes like it's a totally valid question we're spending a lot of money what are we gonna get out of it I think we're gonna get a lot of value we had dares on the dares founded HubSpot daresh is amazing yeah he's really wise um and he's tends to be right more than he's wrong and I think he said something great when I asked him I'm like man I'm a little nerv about a lot of this stuff where the world is going to go and he's like well I'm fairly educated and I think that it's not going to be as good or bad as you think it's going to be do you uh agree with that sentiment no I think I think it's actually pretty bodal I think it' be like bad or it's like it could be much much better so great it's it's the opposite it's either going to be much worse or much better is kind of your take what what's the bad like what's the bad situation look like where like like for example I think the bad situation and I'm fairly educated so take it with the great ass Sal the very bad situation is that there's just going to be this massive gap between the halves and the halves not and like if you have money now that's going to grow and you're gonna be awesome the bad situation is AI kills us all right that's the uh the Doom situation that that's a bad situation but then I there but in route to that there is just this massive separation of the halves and halves not have nots you know what I'm saying that kind of freaks me out what's your what's your where do you see the bad situation going going towards so I think it is not necessarily that Cor ated that your your resources or your Capital today mean that you most take advantage of the of the AI Revolution right I actually think people have a lot of agency in this right they can go start these businesses make a million dollars um that's such a small group of people why does it have to be because of human nature how many people know about this [ __ ] go do your well your parents are Tech entrepreneurs but go go ask Sean's mom and dad go ask my parents go ask my brother and sister like people are not entrepreneu even if this widens the number of people who can be successfully entrepreneurial it's not going to like it's going to go from 0.1% or whatever 1% of the population to I don't know not 50 right it's not going to go that far yeah I don't know if it has to express in pure entrepreneurialism versus like you will get increased productivity for people in lots of different types of jobs and it's not obvious to me that's like just the people who are already most highly paid today you're somebody who thinks a lot about AI you spend your time in the AI ecosystem a lot of very smart people are actually worried about the Doom scenario you know from Elon Musk to we had EMT cheer on the podcast and emt's a smart thoughtful guy and he's like you know the P Doom the probability of of actual Doom here is is pretty scary it's not zero and and here's here you know here's where I think it is what do you think about that what are the odds that AI truly is a sort of like a critically dangerous thing you know I don't actually spend a lot of time thinking about this problem because the because it is like conjecture in the future of both the objectives of these models and capabilities of these models that are kind of like handwavy right like if like I think when you talk to experts about um some of the suggested scenarios like here are two classic ones oh you know people are going to use this to design a virus that kills us all um bioweapons or somebody is going to make the objective for a foundation model that is super powerful to be like make the most money or generate the most paper clips and it's going to take over all of the resources in the world and kill us all there's no linear path from here to there and so when when people ask me about like the Doom scenario like I am much more concerned about abuses we actually do understand so for example like what if people don't understand what information is true or not or like people are going to use this stuff for hacking and fraud and lots of like bad activities today and like we should go understand that and react as quickly as possible to that and as a country like probably want to stay ahead on these capabilities technically well have you heard any what are some what's a wild example of how people use this for hacking or for fraud like for for my company we get emails from me it's not really me and sometimes it will have or um it'll have a link to something that sounds like it's in my voice yeah I think that's the simplest example which is well like what happens if you can create really authentic sounding media like you know are are your parents like you know going to not pick up the phone if it's a spoofed phone number and it sounds like you and you say you need something like that's a bad scenario and so I think we need more tools to protect against that and general education about it so I I worry more about that and then I'd say like I think of the probability of a bad scenario I said was like it is possible I can't see exactly how we get there and if you ask me like what are the reasons in which uh broad use of cheap intelligence are going to be great I can give you so many reasons right so Andre kPa just started a company around education and uh like the the the fields that have been super resistant to cost Improvement basically Healthcare the government and education like I I think this will actually move the needle on some of the domains that matter a lot to all of us humans um and I I think like when when people talk about like the Doom scen it's really fun and scary to talk about the dystopian Doom scenario but uh I think the opportunity cost of not exploring the ways in which like there you know you can have an economy of abundance we need to talk about that and that is really what I focus on Sam do you know who Andre karpati is no but I love his name it's a lovely name Andre is a is a uh amazingly well-respected research scientist and educator who's trying to create um like an experience uh that is AI powered in education where like the most amazing expert in a domain is like a personal tutor taking you through the material interactively and he's one of like the five big thought leader type guys he ran Tesla's AI program uh in terms of self-driving cars he was like one of the let's say five most known and respected guys about that he then went to open aai he then quit open aai it says He's listed as a co-founder of open AI so so I guess he the man he was like the early uh early mind behind it and at Tesla he was basically the the guy leading their entire self-driving unit um I think he's I forgot what his title was he's like you know Chief AI guy when I lived in San Francisco it was a fun period I lived there from 20 12 to basically 2020 or 20 22 and back then it was like the airbnbs of the world and Tesla or um Uber and we had sidecar back then where it was like holy crap we're g to get to a stranger's car and this is so exciting this is so new and and you'd go to hackathons and people were working on like meal delivery services and that was like really cool I went recently or this was about a year ago and I was walking uh around the ferry building and this kid recognized me he's like oh Sam you know I like the Pod uh I go hey what's up man and he said I'm doing a hackathon right now in the ferry building upstairs do you and your wife want to come up and like see what's going on and I was like hell yeah let's do it and so we go up there and it was so invigorating I was like dude we used to do this exact same thing but it was around like the sharing economy and all this type of stuff and they were I was just talking to people what they were building and I remember thinking like this is like totally I guess it happens in San Francisco a bunch I was like this is like the Renaissance like there's something really really cool going on and everyone was doing AI stuff and I just thought it's magical right when I moved there it was like mobile was the thing it was like oh X for mobile everything we got to make we got to make it work on a iPhone and an Android and then you would see like you know some like false Flags like front back came out it's like oh [ __ ] this is the next thing this is the next big social app and then it would kind of die but then you know Instagram Snapchat you know they they they actually they stuck and I remember the early days of musically that now become Tik Tok and so mobile was like the big thing at the time then it became crypto and it became the crypto Hub um but it started to lose a little bit of the Steam for crypto because crypto was a lot more International um but now it looks like for AI San Francisco at least is back as the The Hub s are you in in San Francisco yeah uh we're in the mission in San Francisco and like I I think we really believe in these sort of like Community aspect of um not in the like maybe in the squishy sense of the word too but like if you're think about looking for ideas for companies and being inspired to like be committed to the grind and have the right ideas then the right thing to do is not do it like alone in your basement what you have in San Francisco are people who are optimistic and then like work oriented they believe lots of things are possible they're learning about what's going on at the frontier and we actually do this grant program embed ed. conviction. comom to create that kind of community and a bunch of other stuff but it is it is around this idea that you people want to have the experience that you described Sam which is like well like not all of this is going to work but what are smart people trying that is some version of the future in this area of AI and like that will probably educate and inspire me and some of it will be really big yeah I think that like if you're 22 um and you're young and single and you're into this [ __ ] I would just say two words I would say go west Go West Young Man like by the way people always talk about San Francisco it's dangerous it's dirty it's Lawless that's the appeal baby you can say you you made it in the war torn city of San Francisco you don't want to be a billionaire who is coddled you want to be a billionaire who grew up on the Mean Streets of San Francisco yeah not that mean all right I think we have to wrap up Sarah thanks for coming on where should people find you and uh where where where should they follow you you can just Google Sarah Goa or conviction. comom and I'm on I'm on Twitter um all right that's it that's the pod thanks guys [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
anyways this was my Sunday brainstorm my Sunday brainstorm was here's three cool [Music] ideas dude let's do like a life update because frankly you and I mostly talk to each other I mean we spent so much time on this podcast we don't even like talk that much I want to know what's going on with you and I'll fill you in on what's going on with me I did a thing I've never really done before it's not that groundbreaking I'm sure you or many people have done this but I hadn't and uh Friday hit and I just put my phone in a drawer and I didn't touch it till this morning so I had a no phone weekend which was pretty awesome and very unusual for me you're not good at that like you're you're hardcore about your phone so tell me how that felt uh it felt like it withdrawals from an addiction like I would find there was like funny things and then there was like little moments where I would notice it a lot more right so like grabbing your pants all the time I would just keep patting my pocket like I would put my kids in their car seat shut the door and I'm walking around the car to get to my side and I instinctively I'm trying to Pat to check my like why do I need to check my phone in this three second break that I have walking around my car it's pretty crazy and there was just like a hundred moments like that where I instinctively wanted to go and you know just pull to refresh basically I needed to go see a feed it's like I need to get my feed and so you know it was nice to to do that I found myself doing random I was like humming a lot I read a lot I was just like our kids are kind of picky eaters and we haven't really taught them to eat very well on their own and so like we feed them every meal basically still and and so I'm sitting there and I'm feeding them normally I've got my phone they've got their cartoons we we're basically all just cartooned up and I'm just shoving bites of mac and cheese in their mouth and it really slowed me down like time went way slower but not in a bad way necessarily it was a lot more peaceful I would say also was a was a was part of the the upside of not having my phone did you use your computer or Apple TV or cable TV this we yeah so the rule was I don't have to be like without the internet or without any entertainment I didn't go Amish I was allowed to watch TV and I was allowed to use my laptop if the opportunity presented itself but on the weekends I'm pretty much fully in dad mode so we're not I'm not really on the computer a whole lot and even just the physical distance of like the computer that's in your pocket all the time versus okay I guess if I want to go on the internet I'm allowed to I'm allowed to go on Twitter if I want to but I just have to go to my computer open it up type in the thing and then like you know I could only be on my laptop for so long basically so that was a good a very good break and something I'm going to do a lot more of because I don't like the idea of being addicted to something and I would say by any definition I'm completely addicted to my phone if I don't have it I kind of freak out a little bit I'm like I gotta go get my phone hold on wait wait wait whatever we're doing I gota get my phone I left my phone in the other room I gotta go get it and it's pretty crazy that that's the case finding myself instinctively reaching into my pockets or like really wondering like what time is it did somebody text me it's like who cares uh you know I I don't really need any of this did you follow the news well that was of course the craziest thing is while I'm not on my phone my wife is like oh my God Trump got shot I'm like oh man this is the one thing that like the craziest news in the world happens testing my uh my resolve here and so I did get on my laptop a little bit later and check out what was going on and and and read all the crazy stuff but I I stayed off my phone so that's was good have you ever heard of no fap November yeah so I like how you just said that as if it's like a a scientific phenomenon like you were like have you ever heard of mitosis it's when the cell split like Rebrand it like have you ever heard of non fap November well so like I think that's a great movement and they like mix it with humor or whatever but there's like a reason whatever and so basically for people who don't know it's just guys who don't jerk off for November and I don't I don't know if the rules are you can't have sex or if it's just Mass I don't know what the rules are but I don't know never never made it past day two so couldn't tell you yeah clearly not into it we we got to have a cute funny brand for like no F uh weekend no phone or something like that you know what I mean no no scroll Sundays at Le no scroll Sundays is good but a lot of my Jewish friends and family you know they do no phones from Friday evening to Saturday evening and they all say the same thing this is like this is the best like it's it's it's wonderful so we have to we have to like do a take on that and we'll have to have like a some type of a cute way to do like Friday to Sunday no phone right have you seen people who raw dog flights yeah dude that is so funny so explain what it is for people who don't know so raw dogging a flight is what uh I think it's mostly men so men are like can't imagine a girl would ever care to do this raw dogging raw dogging a flight is when it's like when a guy goes out of like a Delta plane and you know how like when you fly you see the plane going across America and that's all you see and and it's guys who will just stare at that for the entire time no music no phone no books no movies they just raw dog it and I think it is the the funniest thing going on right now I love raw dogging fights yeah yeah exactly I think it's I think it's hilarious I'm I'm bringing on this though this like no like control your inputs I think in all all facets of life right control the foods that you put in your mouth control the information you put in your mind control the people you let in World control the amount of the number of problems you are willing to make your problem I think that that is probably the most underrated skill you can have as somebody who's trying to leave a good life is learning how to control your inputs so we're doing like a little bit of Life update and I was going to say that's one of my updates is I am not really reading the news a lot and I'm honestly like I I don't have Twitter on my phone the news man particularly this weekend when a lot of crazy stuff went down it is exhausting me and like current events I find it to be it wears me out and um uh I'm just I'm trying to refer like mostly to book to books when I want like entertainment as opposed to just scrolling through news it kills me dude it wears you out 100% 100% And I I used to get a lot of [ __ ] for this I haven't I don't watch the news I haven't I never have a news app on my phone I don't follow like News Social accounts typically um you know obviously some news just Brute Forces its way into your world that's kind of what happened this this weekend with the with the shooting and stuff like that but um but for the most part I uh completely abstain from the news and I used to feel somewhat ashamed of that like kind of ignorant that just wasn't really interesed it wasn't very hard for me to abstain from it but I called you I call I called you out on that one time when we were just hanging out off air I was like you're not a good citizen and now I've done a 180 I'm like no it's not important what's going on like in most cases isn't isn't important well my trainer gave me a great perspective on it he was like it was one of the years when the election was going on or maybe it was like the the state elections or some [ __ ] like that and everybody was talking about voting and every was talking about it was kind of getting heated as politics tends to do and he just said something in passing he was just like he's like I don't worry about the government I'm try I'm trying to govern myself I found that I can't even govern myself what am I worried about what's going on across the country in Washington DC I can't govern myself yet and so he's like I focus on that he's like if we all did that society would be actually in a much better place if we all learn to govern ourselves a little bit better and so he when he was talking about the the current election cycle somebody was criticizing and they're like oh well you know you're not doing your your kind of your civic duty he's like he's like I don't know about he's like I don't know what you think your civic duty is he's like I'm in the grocery store I'm helping the old lady I'm over here I'm talking to a friend I see a kid doing something I give him a compliment you know like there are many ways that you could be a good member of society and just being like fully up to dat on the news and having an opinion on everything or like you know downloading today's big problem is not necessarily the only way to do it I kind of like that of like govern yourself first then be like a positive influence in your grocery store in the place around you that seems like a much better way to actually have an effect than just uh you know siphoning off uh CNN all day what else you got the Life Update Corner anything else good for me so I'm I'm I'm currently in Connecticut where I'm staying for a little while I go to the beach every morning and I go to the beach most evenings at 8:30 after the baby's gone to sleep um I'm n months walking or what you what are you doing on the beach dude I have a scooter like a electric scooter it has an odometer I go through sand what do you mean no like I ride from my house to the beach a mile away I have 2,000 miles on this scooter I drive it everywhere there sometimes I'll go two weeks without driving a car I just drive a scooter everywhere I'm nine months into having a kid it's the best I'm so freaking happy like it's just I genuinely feel like a happier human being and I had a little mini not midlife crisis but I've been asking myself like what's the point of like this or that like I you ask yourself I've asked myself about all types of things like why do I care about this why am I doing this being more intentional and I think it's because I'm so happy like when you get happy and you have less of a chip on your shoulder that's kind of a weird feeling if you've spent years like grinding and things like that oh you're saying you're asking the question because you're happy yeah because I'm happy I'm like why am I doing this or that like you know what I mean you start questioning things so I'm really happy uh right now so that's kind of like the biggest update from me all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turn it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly it's pretty awesome that they took this internal document that we had for teaching our analysts how to do this into a tool and are giving it away for free that anyone can download so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show I'm with you I got I got two things I saw a great Seinfeld clip the other day and it said it was Sefi talking and he goes you know why I believe in God and the guy goes why he goes God made it so that people who don't have kids don't don't know what they're missing and that's the nicest thing they could ever do for somebody and I thought oh wow that's a really like powerful way of putting it because I'm the same way uh like I just my my cup feels incredibly full just because of what's going on in my house regardless of really anything else which not to get too sentimental but it's pretty awesome and for anybody who's out there on the fence or or you know wants to wait or whatever it really is amazing and it is a it is a hard to describe phenomenon how good it feels to just especially like your your kid's pretty young right she's only what less than a year old once they're like two three four and you can play with them it is like such a golden period of time um I do have a a life story here with a life life little life hack uh what's that so we go to a birthday party kids birthday party and um you know there's a bunch of three and four-year-olds running around and it's at a park and there's a it's like a park with like a splash area where there's like water coming out of the ground and we show up and I noticed something I noticed that there's like all the parents are standing on one side kind of like standing in the heat sweating trying to get shade just like kind of like you know kid runs up needs to drink of water they give him water and then the kid runs back and plays and the and the parents are all making sort of awkward small talk with each other and you could just see the like they're looking at the watch they're ready to get out of there it's like okay we'll be here for an hour then we got to go do the next thing and um so my kids run in and I'm like I just see like while we're walking up to the party I see like a fork in the road it's like I can take the right path and I can go hang out with the parents or I could just go run around with my shirt off in the splash pad and so wait was this dur I chose the road I chose The Road Less Traveled and I went down to the splash pan and I had so much fun and I just played with my kids I'm up in the playground we're we're going the splash pad we're playing tag we're doing like water like kind of like water fight um and I just have a blast two hours go by I look over all the other parents are still just sweating and waiting and what I realized was like the the great parenting hack because before I had a kid I did read a couple of books about like you know what to expecting when she's expecting or whatever like you know how to be a dad you know I want to be good at something I'll read a couple books and see if there's any good information in there I now have a book that I'll write which has one line it in it which is don't worry about being a dad just be a kid and the best part about kids is that they keep you they keep you fresh they keep you playing they keep you you have to act like you're astonished and things are fascinating to get them excited about things and actually it kind of makes you excited and it makes you more curious because you're doing that for them but the other part of it is the easiest way to be a parent is to literally just play with your kid 80 to 90% of the time and sure 10% of the time you snap back into adult mode and you make sure that you know the train doesn't go completely off the rails but I found that I have so much more fun as a dad if I just lean in and just like completely play with them all day and I don't know why more parents don't don't do this um like I'm in gymnastics class I'm doing like literally cartwheels I'm on the trampoline like I'm doing all the things with them because if I have to be there anyways I might as well have a good time that's contagious for them they have a better time I'm in a better mood which makes me more patient you know like it's a it's a complete life hack dude I could just see you like Bounce Around Gymnastics and break some kids [ __ ] femur because you sit on it well definitely not everything is built for for me uh so you know there's there's definitely been some uh some some spills but yeah it's great like yeah I woke up yesterday I literally woke up we go to a coffee shop go to a hit up a doughnut shop go to soccer class I'm playing soccer in the soccer class and then after soccer we just wanted to play some more so we're playing and now four other kids just join me and it's me my kids and four other random kids that are all just like playing soccer afterwards then we go to uh the pool and we're in the pool for three hours and we come home they we're playing smash Kart which is this like version of Mario Kart that my kids are able to play because they're like toddlers we're playing that then we eat a little bit of dinner we read some books and then we go to bed and it was like I was just a kid for the whole day and there I had a great day are you going to have more youve got three how many more would you want to do no my cup runneth over I'm full I'm I am completely happy as is I don't I don't really feel the need to have any more kids I've got Sarah bought into three but in my head I'm like yeah you know like but if we're if we're GNA go three like five would be interesting right like you know what I mean I I definitely am currently in the more is better at camp but like I don't have to push it out so it's easy for me to say which uh but no man being a dad is awesome it has completely changed things I tweeted this out before we we had kids like years ago and I was like because I had a I had a bunch of friends who would would were doing psychedelics because they felt lost and some of them kind of went over the edge where they took too many and like they started acting a little weird where I'd be like hey are you okay and I just think that having a child kind of filled that void for me where I didn't feel like I needed to do psychedelics because I didn't have a lack of meaning right and so it's been it's been really it just makes me happy um but you've got a lot of interesting topics here I got a lot of interesting stuff okay so I have three ideas that I want to want to pitch you and I'm going to basically tell you about a cool business and then I'm going to tell you a idea I think somebody could start that's similar to that cool business so the first one is sketchy have you ever seen sketchy decom it is kind of an incredible business idea I I'm sort of jealous I didn't start this business so if you go to sketch.car made unfor sketchy turns what you need to know into creative visual stories you'll remember forever oh this is awesome right basically it's learned to take the mcats or the the Medical Board exams with cartoons and drawings instead of like boring textbooks and what they did was they created a Kaplan or like a g you know what are the big like test prep Princeton Review they created a test prep type of business but they did two things one they focused on a specific Niche so basically Med med student so before you get into Med medical school you want to take the mcats or after you're in med school you're you're going through your your um your medical classes and then eventually the boards and second The Twist was they were like cool but some people will prefer to learn in a way that's way more Visual and way more um sort of like visual friendly you know easy to remember rather than um kind of traditional learning and I love this because a that's how I like to learn um that sounds more fun sounds more interesting and there's actually like a bunch of science around um why we learn better through visuals in the same way we talked about last last time about Jingles how how audio like a catchy earworm is a much better way to remember something so it's basically storytelling and cartoons to teach you things specifically for um doctors uh for test prep and do they make all the cartoons and you pay a monthly fee yep that's exactly got all right and so this business um I saw this I was like wow this is a great idea I'm so there's also just like a cool business it's like it's like a cool thing to do with your life it's kind of like Khan Academy when the guy's like yeah actually like I just kind of want to make like a course for every everything on the internet for free and it's just me kind of talking and writing things out and trying to explain things I'm I'm you know I'm a pretty good explainer and that's how he you know started just explaining things to his own nephews or whatever and then he published on the internet and people liked it so I really like this business because I think it has like a cool Mission I think it's a cool business model and I think that um it's a it's a fun product that that I'm glad exists and what's the business model because uh it looks like Educators use that so do they how's it how's it work do they work with I'm sure they do a bunch of things my my thinking is that this is um it's very simple it's you're a student who wants to pass an exam that's the the the the bleeding neck problem right that's the the highest urgency problem and so they're going to is bleeding yeah probably can't say that anymore huh is bleeding is bleeding neck problem your no it used to be hair on fire that's what Dave McClure said and then somebody said bleeding neck I like that too oh my God all right so I think that's the thing somebody wants to pass a test they need a they need help studying for it they see this and they're like oh this seems like more fun to to do than the other way and you pay you know something like 25 to 50 bucks a month for this and you sign up for a 62 or 24mth plan and then you go through it you're like wow that was actually really useful way to study and now the next test happens maybe it's your your um your board exam or maybe it's just a really hard course in med school and they have like kind of the the supplemental thing for anybody on their like med school Journey wow and the re the only article I could find about them is in 2020 where it says that they were doing I think 88 million in revenue and then did they also raise 30 million bucks yeah they raised 30 million bucks it says on their website that 500,000 students have used their thing that's a lot that's a big number um but I think some a business like this is set to dominate a niche and I think that test prep is a is a proven business model this takes a 20% Twist on it which is the visual cartoon thing and by the way what an amazing name sketchy docomo congrats to the people who who did this I think this is really cool so now um what's the idea so so I tried to convince do you remember Dylan and Henry the guys behind um clipped smart nonsense and clipped these basically if you don't know them they're young guys we met them because they came to our house and built out our our podcast Studio they were fans of podcast college and then what they started doing was they um they had their own podcast and they would cut Clips they would cut clips for our podcast then they started cutting clips for Allin so right when Allin blew up they were the ones doing the animated clips for them and so they got popular there then they created an agency called clip where you can hire like a video editor from them um like a video header in the Philippines who's a really good animator who can uh for a monthly fee be be your animator and that business is doing well so that got to kind of like low seven figures of of annual revenue and then they started using their own animators to do their own YouTube content and they both blew up on YouTube and so like Henry has like I don't know millions of subscribers now on YouTube and he'll just do like really short form shorts are really good like I've never seen someone take shorts that seriously so for the listener it's basically him talking and he's clearly he got a green screen behind him behind him because you see all these weird interesting animations pop up up to interact with him and what he's saying it's awesome and so those guys are awesome I I I really see a lot of myself in them I don't know how old they are I think they're like 25ish years old and they remind me so much of how I was when I was 24 25 26 and U so I really like these guys and I think they do a bunch of dumb [ __ ] by the way but that's okay I did so much more dumb [ __ ] when I was there AG they're way ahead of where I was like allegedly showing up to a meeting without a shirt on yeah they well you can tell that story that's a good story I don't I don't remember if it was them but that seems like something in the Wheelhouse where their genre the story is we we got them a contract with HubSpot to do clips for us and other other things and uh I guess they showed up to one of the video calls without a shirt on which is uh cool by me actually you know common practice where I'm from but I guess uh didn't fly so well in the Fortune 500 so maybe they lost that contract I don't know exactly if that was the reason or maybe a contributing factor to the they get they get a pass they get a pass because they were like 21 and uh they they've redeemed themselves so I don't I think they're doing good I don't want to [ __ ] out they're doing great um and and so I I went to them I was like guys you should make this but for the SATs so do this for the SATs or for I for APS or IB exams start wherever great idea but I was like this is a great idea and who there's no one on earth Better Built to do this than you two because of their skill set they're amazing storytellers they are really good with animated cartoons and stuff I don't know if you've seen their newsletter but they have like a style newsletter it's great they created this like character and they tell great stories through it I'm like dude just do that but instead of doing it for free for random subjects on the internet charge for it and do it for something that people are willing to pay for which is test prep like people need to pass this test to move on to the next phase of their life why would they not do that that sounds so much better than I mean they I was in the newsletter business newsletter business is hard this sounds way better hard and I tried to tell them I was like guys that's that's if that's okay or good this is what great would look like in the same genre like the same work you're doing just applied in a different way and they were like we agree with you ah but we just don't want to do it we were gonna have more fun doing this other stuff like we don't know what but maybe these other three ideas and I was like Hey honestly more power to you like you that that's actually cool I support you guys in that but now I can give the idea away for free out here which is like I wrote them a business plan I wrote them like a Google doc and I was like here's how I would do it here's how we'll go to market here's the here's that how will charge for it I'll fund it like just do this guys this is like this is how you disrupt a Kaplan or a princ in review is you take a you take your black belt that they have in social media content like they are top 1% level content creators but instead of competing for free views in the in the free market of of social media apply it in this place that's like really backwards and stodgy and hasn't changed in 30 years which is test prep for the SATs or test prep for the gmats or whatever and um and so I think somebody could still go do this I think somebody could take sketchy and do it in another Niche you could do it in whatever it is Dentistry nursing whatever and I'm sure sketchy will try to do some of those things it doesn't matter I think this a piie is big enough and I think if you just take the the principles of what they did um I think you could have a lot of success with so that's idea number one what do you think of that idea what was sketchy so that's that's actually uh one of the better ones that we've talked about but sketchy wasn't always sketchy what were they doing before because they launched in 2013 or did it take seven years to get to 7 million Revenue cuz that's a pretty I don't know I don't know their full backstory yet and then I see of course chin group is the one who put 30 million into him I'm like God damn it everything I find that I'm like o this is cool this is interesting I'm ahead of the curve it's like oh like you know yeah churnin F funded us you know a year ago right like we were we did an episode on the guy the gardening guy at Epic gardening and I'm like dude this guy can be big actually this could be really huge I'm trying to like tell people they're like what gardening I've never heard of that and I'm like I go I'm like hey dude I will write you a big check like let me fund you I believe in you he's like we're all good on funding churnin gave me like I don't know whatever 20 million bucks like a year ago it's like oh damn um wow how are they ahead of me on all of these I'm gonna give this a nine out of 10 I think this is great I think this is awesome all right I think this is sketchy is a great one now the next one Babylon B yes have you lived under ackq a little bit I'm not saying this is new but I don't think for most people they really appreciate this so if you haven't seen this it's a satirical news site so it's like the onion but it's just like a variation of the onion they have been around for a little while but they just seem to getting more and more popular and I think a big part of it is that Elon retweets them a lot and so if you're on Twitter you see them because hey they put out good content but B they had like a turbo boost from the most popular guy on Twitter and so I just I I've I've seen this and I'm like wow this business model is really interesting to me it's a media company but it's got such a different approach right so the way a media company grows is you make content that's worth spreading and so there's a tension there for most companies because you need to write what's going on you want to be trusted but then you kind of need to clickbait the [ __ ] out of everything to get people to click and come to your site and so you're constantly in this like too much clickbait I kind of lose trust too much just trust in factuality too much dryness nobody clicks my thing nobody shares this nobody reacts to it nobody gets outraged and reposts it and says this is [ __ ] and then that's what gets people to share so you kind of want to outrage people or you want to get them to share something but then you don't want to be overly Sensational so they always have this tension and by the way so I ran a company that was a media company that made money on advertising and I hated that feeling that you're describing I thought email would solve it a newsletter instead of a website which it did it actually helped solve it yeah the news that comes to you yeah it helped and then but I was still mad at that that that existed so I thought subscriptions will solve that so we launched a subscription thing that within year one was doing like 5 million Revenue still doesn't solve it you still got to do the same game a newsletter monetizes so much better than a just a general News website so like you know you could have a million subscriber newsletter and that business should be doing five to10 million a year I would say broad Strokes a million subscribers should get you you know five million plus in Revenue if you do a News website and you get a million visitors a month that ain't [ __ ] that ain't [ __ ] you might be not be doing anything so like you know the Babylonian b or whatever the Babylon B these guys are they'll do 25 million plus visits to their site the biggest newsletters in the world don't have 25 million subscribers right so it's or readers so it's a it's a different game it's a volume game when you're trying to get you're trying to make a media destination versus a newsletter anyways I guess like the the the thing I'm trying to say is an underrated part of these media sites is this tension this inherent tension between trust and viral kind of like spreadability and so the beautiful thing about this C where you go and you try to be the onion you do fake news as a service you do you know satire is it doesn't need to be factually correct so you only have to win on that one dimension which is sharability and in this case you'll share people will share because it's funny and it'll share because it strikes a cord with people and that's why this has spread so quickly and so the the the backstory of this is I think it's started by one guy and then he kind of like sold it to the two writers of it well you're missing a big part here which is so the onion which is a satire website although most satirical websites are left leaning this one is right leaning I think also has a Christian component to it a little bit yeah uh so whereas many of these things tend to be left of center this is right of Center exactly so that's where I'm going to get to with the opportunity so the guy who started he calls himself a Christian entrepreneur right and he started off doing Christian cartoons and then it became now the guys you write it it's more just about cons leans more conservative than it does uh the other way but I think there's a lot more like the world is not just liberal and conservative there's like a hundred other variations segments of the market that could be served with this same category so I'll give you two that I think somebody should should go do so I think somebody could go do the far more right-wing version of this so I think that this like super right so so these guys I think are conservative but they're still kind of like more Centrist than they are are full right but like if you go read like dredge or infowar like there's a whole appetite in the world for like really really far drudge yeah really far right-wing stuff so I think you could go do that but here's here's another angle altogether it's not political at all which is just do the onion but only for uh fake news articles that appeal to just like the millennial mom and because like you know the millennial mom follows a certain set of new subjects so um you know you maybe it's a little bit less on Sports but maybe they watch The Bachelor so they understand the Bachelor memes maybe it's that they uh are following the Taylor Swift stuff maybe it's that they're follow whatever whatever topics are of interest do the onion for that category because it's a very valuable category and by the way this might exist already I I have no idea I I don't I don't even know how you search for this but I think that that would be a very successful version of The Onion that's not or or of the Babylon B which is not political at all but it's the same thing it's poking fun at a certain set of popular subjects but make those popular subjects a different customer than the one who reads the onion or the one who reads the Babylon B here's why I know that that's uh that that's true about the millennial mom so we had this couple over that have a one-year-old over to our house and the kids started crying and so I go to grab a bunch of toys to like entertain him and like show him off I'm like oh I bet you haven't seen this thing and I start like using this puppet or whatever and the mom is like yeah we have this toy we have that toy in fact all of the toys that you have we have the exact same ones and I'm like well you guys just clearly follow like the same like three people on Instagram and you read the same blogs CU you have bought all of the same stuff and like I couldn't impress this kid I'm shocked at how the millennial mother uh like there's probably like six buckets and it's like just a different persona for each thing but for each bucket it's like just buy all of this stuff read all of this stuff it's so interesting do you know what I mean yeah exact but I think every segment's that way right I think I think there's a a a Joe Rogan bro version of that where it's like oh let me guess favorite podcast Rogan huberman right let me guess you you cold plunge let me guess you do this let me guess and you could kind of predict their life if you know one or two things about them and there's I don't know a giant cluster of people that will fit that description not everybody of course but there's a giant cluster of people and that's kind of what you need when you're doing media is you need a giant cluster of people who kind of have a taste match and so I think you take that business model apply it to a new segment and again this might already exist it doesn't really matter they you don't have to be the first you just have to be successful at it which means just do a good job at it and I think the way to start this by the way would just be Instagram you just make an Instagram account you don't even need a website and just make an Instagram account that's doing these kind of like funny news things like there's a version of this in sports that that I follow where they just post like funny sports like fake sports headlines that make fun of the NBA and I think that can be done so many times over and I think it's probably one of the easiest ways to build a media business you know what's interesting is the guy who started the Babylon uh Babylon B you said he sold it his website uh his personal website it's called Adam 4d.com it's all dedicated to web comics it's just a comic website uh which is intriguing because that's similar to what uh what's his name Dylan and Henry do um does is who owns Babylon B now I think it's those Seth and uh Seth and Dan there's like these the I think the main writers now it says in 2018 he sold it to them he kept a stake until 2023 when he sold the remaining stake to the to the Dylan Brothers do you know who owns the onion oh the isn't it the guy who started twio or something the guy who started twio so instead of like Rich billionaires you know they liked to Jeff Bezos bought the Washington Post one of those Facebook guys bought I forget some other one you know Mark Benny off I think bought time Jeff Larsson I think his name is he bought the onion which is actually like an interesting purchase yeah I think that's a great idea by the way that's that's what I like my billionaires doing right do do interesting things uh go buy the onion make sure the onion doesn't die because I think the onion was kind of dying right he like is trying to save it he's trying to like reverse it out of like pretty much bankruptcy yeah so the onion has been around I think since 1988 so it's been around forever and it just like it's a [ __ ] business to to have to run for a little while particularly in the last like eight years where digital media has just been crap uh but yeah it's hard it's a hard business because also when you think about what's adverti or what's the media business it's advertising who's gonna want to advertise on an article that's fake do you know what I mean like maybe I don't know like I think that if you could curate the right high value audience and they TR your voice to talk about a subject it's kind of like comedians right why are why do people sponsor comedy podcasts it's like dud these guys are vulgar they're just saying random [ __ ] this is not like smart information this is whatever but it's they have a trusted audience the audience trust them and so when they do the ad read people dig it um that people trust them because they've you know they've kept it real on all these other subjects so I think you could do it there and I think there's not that big of a gap between you know a comedy you know brand and a comedy podcast for example yeah I think the difference is that a lot of people think that the Babylon B and stuff like that I think they think they they the're real and they share them as if it's real do know what I mean like that's actually a massive issue let's do the last one toxic tampons yes so I saw this tweet about a Tik Tok that went viral so there was a Tik Tok of a woman walking through kind of like a a store and she's she's in the aisle the tampon aisle and she's talking about you see all the big Brands Tampa you see whatever and 5 million people saw this video because Berkeley released a paper basically saying hey the popular tampons all have like toxic Metals Arsenic and other contaminants in them and so that's concerning and so there's like a moment here where I think I don't know who is the leading player who's doing native deodorant for tampons but whoever there whoever that is they're in a good position and whoever uh if nobody's doing it somebody should go do that or even if somebody's doing it I still think it's a good idea which is it seems like there's a general trend of people being concerned about gut health about microplastics about is your water clean or is there like you know contaminants and heavy metals in your water well this seems like another category that's I think going to get transformed right I think I think people are not gonna if you can use the fear and uncertainty and doubt around the safety of tampons I think you could build a new kind of like alternative clean uh clean brand around it but what I'm trying to prevent here is a bunch of dudes talking about [ __ ] where like every woman's listening and they're like yeah we know we use these eight brands do you know what I mean so I actually I have no idea could very well be and I would love to be educated feel feel free to DM me I'll tell you what in my home I only see the popular stuff yeah and in general like I don't know how many hundred million dollar companies uh hundred million dollar year Revenue businesses are there that are doing this there will be trust me there will be one there will be two there will be three that are in this category like the the current incumbents will either adapt or be replaced by Alternatives that are going to uh that are going to play on these health concerns this is not going to go nowhere right look at your detergents look at your soaps look at your deodorants this has happened in pretty much every other category they're going to do it here and this is a great product because high margin repeat purchase and you know like the other thing is that it's usually women's products tend to be underserved compared to the ideas that most guys have around what businesses that they'll go start so you kind of can compete in a less a less saturated field than um you know making to-do list apps or whatever whatever like the average whatever the average bro idea will be yeah and what's interesting is that with a lot of these Brands like they'll they'll be like I I need to come up with some Innovative new thing and our friend Moyes when he was selling native deodorant the buyer of the company was like well how are you going to expand he's like well can you write the word native on some all natural shampoo who they're like yeah he goes that's how you're going to expand do you have do you do you guys have a printer to do that would you guys be able to type this if I give you the font Could you type it on a on a shampoo bottle yeah all rightwe we should be good then yeah and so with a lot of these braids you don't really need like a significantly more Innovative thing other than you have to be able to make it clean enough that you can accurately describe it as as a better for you alternative but it doesn't need to be a significant thing uh and it's not like native deodorant was original there was plenty of people selling it they just weren't Savvy go-getter entrepreneurs they were like hippies you know who are selling it on Etsy uh and in fact do let's do this go to Etsy and look up tampons let's just see what what's available I like how you're makeing me do it so I get targeted for these ads um all natural there we go um getting some interesting results that are not exactly what I'm looking for is an all natural tampon really like a cup yeah not that natural what I found but we can take this out so so I find this one right the Honeypot company 100% organic regular tampons unscented organic cotton with bioplastic applicator no chlorine no pesticides no fragrance like oh great in in review first review a very good coffee hell all right uh looks like we guys still got some work to do with this idea wait wait wait go back to that what's going on with them why is that like that I think it must be that the shop has other products in it and that's for the shop it's like reviews from the shop not the product yeah okay the shop has fbal teas and other things too a tampon Coffee Company yeah but anyways this was my Sunday brainstorm my Sunday brainstorm were was here's three cool ideas sketchy which is doing visual learning in the medical space The Babylon which is taken off as a satire News website for kind of conservative political news and then this Tik Tok that was going viral obviously tapped into some concerns people have resonated with the public around the toxicity and the metals and the Arsenic that's in um in the popular tampon Brands and for each I think you could just take a 20% remix and do it I think for sketchy you could age you could use sketchy for another another test another customer segment maybe it's AP students or it's sat takers or it's some skure test who knows um I think you could do it for I think that the Babylon B I think could be done for other customer groups other customer segments like the millennial mom is the one I would go for and third would be this uh dude dude native deodorant for tampons and and and maybe there's somebody doing it but this is my Sunday brainstorm of three ideas that uh maybe they're not great ideas but they'll at least get the wheels turned into your brain it's kind of the promise I have here I think this is we got to keep your phone away from you for from other weekends this is good stuff yeah exactly this is what happens when I don't have my phone I want to talk about one more thing I don't want MFM to like talk about politics because I don't think that that's fun and I think this is like a little bit of an escape I was going to start the podcast with you know Sam and I have both sold newsletter businesses so we feel pretty qualified to chime in here on yeah what's going on in our country and that's how every like business and Tech podcast is they're just like you know as a venture capitalist and where I've start my career you know investing in early stage tech companies I just feel pretty qualified to talk to you about what's going on in the Supreme Court right now it's maddening man it's that's maddening and I don't want to become that but I saw that you're into Teddy Roosevelt well I went down this rabbit hole right so I'm like uh the crazy Trump stuff happens and I'm like wow that's crazy you got shot I'm like uh like I wonder how many presidents have been shot at so I tell you wait let me and let me don't answer that question don't answer that question but uh let me tell you something why I'm happy I have read not only the biographies of all of those presidents but also multiple books on E each assassination and one of my and one of my so this is why I'm happy that you're able to talk about this I've walked into your whe I've stumbled into your wheelhouse welcome home Sean one of the reasons and here's this is a trivia question that I would ask people all the time how many presidents and name them who have been assassinated virtually no one gets the second two the first two are easy so okay easy easy assassinations that I can remember let's say Lincoln Kennedy right those are those are easy yeah um let's see what are the hard ones um McKinley because he was he died right before Roosevelt so that was uh I think Roosevelt was the VP right is that is that how that happened he became president I don't remember exactly but it they were in the same ballpark I don't know if Roosevelt was a VP but he could have been okay so we'll leave it there he could have been um and then oh you're right by the way I'm looking it up you're ex yes good job the last one I wouldn't have got but I see it here in the notes is Garfield Andrew Garfield I wouldn't have got that one and and and both of those guys when they got shot it was very it was a very solvable problem so basically up until like the 1910s or 1920s we didn't really believe or we didn't know that germs were a thing and most of these guys when they got shot they got shot and then you go digging around and with a dirty surgeon's hand or a dirty instrument and they get infections and that's how they died exactly so like McKinley died like I don't know eight days later of Garing caused by the wounds not from like the bullet itself you know hitting him in the heart or something Garfield died like six weeks later so I was pretty mindblown so basically I want to know how many presidents have been shot at either hit or missed but a gunshot has been fired at them do you know the number for this I think it's seven or eight or nine like right about there 13 oh my God and there's only been 40 what six president something like that so it's basically a 10% more than that 25% 25% chance of being shot at if you're a president dangerous dangerous job um and then of those aort you know four have died the crazy one that I uh so there's actually two that I found pretty interesting so I tweeted about one of them I didn't talk about the other one can I tell you about the two that I found out were pretty pretty interesting this is this is me beginner level on Wikipedia so I know you know it was roselt was the other one Andrew Jackson Jackson yes the Jackson one is crazy so here's my understanding fill in the gaps for me so the story is Jackson is going to a funeral he and he's 67 years old he walks with a cane he's a kind of an old guy and he's not very popular he he's walking uh he's at the funeral he's walking into the funeral or whatever and a guy approaches him with a pistol and the guy shoots at him the gun goes off but the bullet doesn't come out it's a misfire so the powder explodes but the bullet doesn't doesn't leave the gun and Jackson becomes angry charges at him with his Cane swinging at him with the cane trying to beat him up with his with his game he almost beat him to death he almost beats him well there's conflicting rep one is he beat him up and the other he misses and so I don't know which one's true the other and then the guy takes out a second pistol does the same thing shoots him with a second pistol also misfires other politicians who are there jump on him kind of tackle the guy and they then take both of the guns and they're like man that we got lucky that this guy or maybe he didn't really mean to do it are these fake guns what happened we heard the gun fire but no no bullet hit um and so then they shoot the gun again and the bullet comes out and both guns were actually functioning and they basically said that the odds of both pistols misfiring and jamming like this was like one in 150,000 that's what they estimated the odds of that happening are so low um that's pretty crazy huh and what's here here's what's even crazier is when uh up until probably the 1960s after JFK Secret Service wasn't really much of a thing so the Secret Service wasn't a thing I don't think it was a thing when Garfield got shot which I think was at 19 100 even or so maybe late 1800s uh when JFK got shot uh there was only like 150 uh Service uh Secret Service agents uh it was not big and the budget was Tiny and they were overworked and tired all the time and when Andrew Garfield got shot I I have to look at the date 1881 1881 uh Lincoln was shot 20 years prior you could still after linol got shot you could walk into the White House and schedule an appointment anyone could go see these guys and when Garfield got uh sh sh he was walking from the White House to a train him and a him and a buddy were just walking and someone walked up and shot him it was insane how like you could get away with all this stuff and and it's just it's wild to think about that so the Teddy Roosevelt story was the one that just blew my mind so this the Teddy Roosevelt story goes as follows he um he's supposed to give a speech he's having dinner he leaves the dinner he's getting into his car and as he's walking up to his car a guy comes up to him and shoots him and his hits him hits him right in the chest and Roosevelt got lucky for two reasons I'm sure you already know what are the two reasons I believe the first one was he had his speech in his uh chest in his page a 50 page speech printed out and rolled it rolled up into his uh jacket pocket and the second reason I think is that he was strong his CH his chest muscles were just like he was a buff dude okay the second one was he had is glasses case which was made out of steel so that I was making that up the bullet went through both of those so it went through the speech it goes through the glasses case but it kind of took a lot of the heat off of it and it still hits him in the chest and the story is crazy he's like um he's like so his secretary was ex football player and just tackles the guy and then he's like um you know people are swarming he's like no no no bring him to me bring him to me he's like I want to look him in the eyes and he brings they bring the guy up to his face and he goes why did you do it and the guy doesn't answer and he's like all right forget it take him away he's like but no violence on this guy like don't want this guy hurt in any way like I want him you know through the judicial system so I put him in the car and I guess he's like a hunter and like an anatomist like you know casual anatomist and so he's like you know I'm not they were taken to the hospital he's like I'm not coughing up blood I don't think it's hit my lung um so I think the bullets lodged in there but I think it's okay because it didn't it didn't puncture my lung or my heart and um so he's like take me to the speech so he goes and he still he goes and he delivers like a something like a 50 to 90 minute speech and they have the shirt that he wore and the blood is just soaking out of the shirt Kurt Schilling Style with the sock just as he's giving the speech they now have this like whatever in a museum and um he's giving the speech and he's like he says ladies and gentlemen I don't know where whether you fully understand that I have just been shot but it takes more than a bullet to kill a bull moose that was the line that he gave during the speech after the speech he then goes to the hospital and they're like they take the x-ray they they see the bullets in there but the technology wasn't that good at the time they're like look we could try to take it out but it's risky I think this is how McKinley had just died well the the technology for the X-ray basically was sort of invented for Garfield so I uh I forget what the scientist's name was but around the World's Fair time uh they were trying to invent X-ray and Garfield got screwed up and they were like dude we've heard that you have this thing can you can we be your test patient you got to his bullet on Garfield and so like the X-ray basically it kind of was being developed uh because of yeah because of this this one or two examples well in the end the doctor decided just to leave it in because they're like it's too risky to take it out and so he lives with it for the rest of his life and people asked him they were like do you feel do you still have pain from that and he's like it doesn't bother me more than if it was a bullet sitting in my pocket what a badass did you know did you know that he was partially blind because Roosevelt was a crazy person so he liked to box and he liked be he was a man's man and like there's a story where I think it was one of his AIDS but he would a professional boxer would come in and he'd be like oh you like the Box no he would invite people to spar him in the white house right he'd be like prove it let's see like you like to box let's box and he would box with these guys like professionals and he would like make people get out and they would Spar well one time a guy I think it was his it was his Aid or a partner of his like damaged his eye and so one of his eyes was blind and during the boxing match he was like Hey look we can't tell anyone about this like no one could know that we were fighting it here otherwise I'm would have get in a ton of trouble so so he didn't tell a lot of people but he was blind in one eye yeah he uh he had a detach retina from the boxing match and then uh and then he switched to Judo and Jiu-Jitsu instead like couldn't up there's also I guess some story it was hard I guess when he was born he was born like with some where his organs were like too small for his body or something like that right isn't there something like and that's why he was so active so he was born with like a bad he they they were like you're probably gonna die young and they told his parents he'll probably die as a teenager and he'll be in bed most of the time and he'll die as a teenager and so that's why he was so invigorated uh with life because they were like uh he a he expected to die and B his father was like we have to get you strong you have to you have to be strong so you can survive and so he wanted to exercise and do all the stuff so he could live uh and so that's one of the reasons why he was so active yeah there's like this is like the tip of the iceberg I think there's a bunch of other crazy stories about Teddy Roosevelt also the teddy bear named after him didn't know that after him I believe it's named after him because he was known for hunting bears and stuff like that and so one group one it's like hey we'll take you hunting turns out they had a bear like chained up to a a tree or something and Teddy like sees his poor bear he's like no guys this is not how we do this you got to release that bear and so it was something involving that story involved him having the teddy bear they called him a a bear or teddy bear he didn't like being called Teddy either yeah uh I don't think people call him to his face but there's a whole book called The River of doubt and so basically the river of doubt you read that you you hear that title and you think oh that has to do with you making good decisions or bad decisions and doubting your decisions no there was a river called doubt I think in Brazil that had never been explored after he was President he was like well I'll go I'll go figure out what's and let's let's we got to like map that let's make a map I'll do it and so he goes and he does this River for weeks or months or something like that and he almost dies uh and this is just him wanting to explore and there's all these crazy stories about him like a lot of people accuse him of starting a war just so he could go and fight because he had the it was called the Rough Riders it was his own crew of like these these military folks but no DMX who else had their own Anthem Teddy was pretty hard Teddy was an interesting guy and by the way he lost the election after the guy does this gives a speech during with a bullet in his chest he ends up losing to uh because I guess he had his own third he was a third party candidate at this stage which is pretty crazy he was an interesting guy his uh he also uh his wife died giving birth and so the same day that his daughter was born his wife died and then in the same house that day his mother died and uh he has the story where he said he used to journal every day and that was one day where he wrote In This Journal he goes the light has left my life and that's all he wrote and it's a very touching story and then he goes on this tear where for the next year he's crazy active and they go why are you being so active and he writes ceaseless action outruns depression and so he was basically like doing all these amazing things in order to outrun the sadness of that day and so that's wild what um did are his journals like published anywhere or his Diaries or whatever he was a prolific writer so his first book was actually I think he was in his teens or early 20s his first book was on zoology so he used to collect animals and take them apart and explain like he like he loved Darwin he was like right tried he tried to discover species and he wrote I think dozens a book or if not dozens a book uh books like six or eight books like he wrote many many books so yeah he was really prolific so you can go and read all of his writing he was a really impressive the best uh what's the best book on him that you've read I would read his biography his biography is amazing because he uh he had a lot of bad [ __ ] happened to him in his life and he was very very optimistic wow what a guy Billy of the week I guess well he was his father started Moma the museum the museum his father James Roosevelt like founded that because he was a wealthy guy oh no way and but Teddy Roosevelt by the way horrible businessman he was a horrible businessman that was the one thing that he sucked at he like would invest in like horses and stuff and he would start ranches really bad businessman he was he he blew a lot of money was he a good dude overall or a bad dude right because he's definitely like a a sort of man's man in in all these interesting ways and has like legendary Feats he really lived a very interesting life but character-wise was he a good guy I mean I've never read anything about besides this I think he had strong character I have one massive critique of him and this is when kind of where the phrase all great men can be bad men uh for example he wasn't I felt like the most present father so when his wife died he goes to North Dakota or whatever to do his thing the bad land to do his thing he left his newborn daughter for like a year and a half and you could say like maybe he was like suicidal and he's like I got to get away and you could argue that but he uh he kind of wasn't always around for his daughter I felt but in general he had High character yeah he was a good dude interesting all right well I think that's a fascinating podcast I'm so glad that you uh you have this you and Shane Gillis by the way why is Shane Gillis like such a history like PhD he has a history major he studied history I'm a biology major it couldn't tell you three things what how does he know he knows know a lot about history like too much about history yeah he he knows way more than me uh he has a good like series of History Podcast and he's really uh talented at it um I think it's really fun to read stories so like you'll read uh in the biography about Andrew Jackson beating up this guy and you're like you're just reading it but then you could take this other thing of like put yourself there and you're like that's hilarious or not hilarious but like that's wild you know that someone would do that and so it's fun to read in between the lines and like actually imagine some of these stories it's just I think it's fascinating uh I think it's also cool to uh avoid the mistakes that people make and just copy their the winnings that they do uh so I I don't read any biographies and I but I read a lot about people and I don't know what a word for this is but I basically will study the ideas and the ideas and kind of like core plot lines but I don't care where they grew up how they grew up who they grew up with what the scene was like what their family life was like I I don't really care about a lot of those things and so I find myself fascinated by people but I really want to know their philosophy and then the action of how they implemented that philosophy like the stories of them implementing that philosophy or living up to that philosophy or failing on that philosophy that's really all I care about which is like a very weird subgenre of studying history or these people well let me give you two recommendations so the first recommendation is a book called Manhunt the 12-day chase for Lincoln's killer the reason it's interesting is because you've heard the name John wils Booth that's the guy who assassinated uh Lincoln he was he's an intoxicating character he was sort of like a cult leader he was a famous actor not quite but almost like Brad Pit at the time where everyone recognized him he was a celebrity he was a celebrity and he was a bad he was a bad dude like crazy racist he was a horrible guy but he definitely had this intoxicating like I want to follow you to the death type of vibe where he was really charismatic and he entranced people and so the assassination by definition was a conspiracy it was a group of like 30 people who worked together to to do this and he was uh gone for 12 days so they assassinated Lincoln and he escaped for 12 days and he almost got away with it he was very close to getting away with it and so the 12-day uh man hun the 12 Day Chase for lcky Killers is is a book about the 12 day man Hut and it's a very good page turning read it's very easy the second one is Hellbound and it's about the assassination of MLK a lot of people don't know this but James o Reay the guy who shot MLK and MLK was a great dude he had some Downs he had some downfalls he was uh he cheated on his wife a bunch but he was a net positive he was great a great guy in general but he had flaws James oay shot MLK and he not only did he escape he he escaped for months so basically when he shot MLK he escaped to uh I think he shot him in Memphis and then he drove all over America then he went to Quebec and then he went to Europe and when he was in Europe he was flying around from country to Country and the only reason he got caught was he was in London on his way to rhia rodia which is basically South Africa at the time it was run by a racist regime and he was like they're going to accept me with like wide arms because I just killed MLK they're going to love me he gets through security once he walks through security the security security guard who lets him in he says uh thank you sir and looks look looks down and he sees that he has an additional passport in his pocket and they're like whoa whoa whoa dude why do you have two passports and they pull it out and like oh [ __ ] the one you gave me was fake I just got the real one and he was seconds away from getting away from all this he he was gone for roughly six months he was uh gallivanting all over Europe he was all over Canada he was very close to getting away with it and a lot of people don't realize that about that story and that book I believe is called Hellbound also a page Turner so if you want to read about assassinations those are my two favorite uh assassination books dude we should make a um you know like uh Blue Ribbon when you were a kid or whatever like she just have her own list of like books that we think are awesome that uh that and and some commentary around them like I wish we just had our own we should just make a separate YouTube channel of just us doing like a book club or doing like read a book talk about it and curate for people like the books that we think are just like really unbelievable books for the year yeah I I would love to do that th those two rank really high uh those are some of like I go through Series so like I got obsessed with shipwrecks so I read like 10 books all on shipwrecks so I could tell you like in my opinion what is the cool ship and then I did assassinations of famous people and the reason why I love these books and the reason why I think you don't like biographies biographies don't have a very good beginning in a middle and an end right uh whereas I try to read books that are about an event because an event typically has a beginning in the middle and an end where it's uh you know it's it's more succinct as opposed to 1,00 pages and so I like books that are on events particularly events in America so I can relate a little bit more all right this was fun I'm glad we this did uh did this at the end here that's the pod [Music]

have you heard of this company called solid core no I've been described as that personally but never at a company level because this was like mindboggling to me so an started uh her career at the age of 25 she started a nonprofit because she was out in a run and she ran by homeless shelter and she was like you know I would love to figure out a way to help these people running has helped me get over a lot of issues in my life I should start a running club for these guys and if I make them get up or if I encourage them to get up early at 7:00 a.m. to come to this run maybe that's going to encourage them to make the rest of their day better and hopefully they'll get jobs whatever so she starts this thing called back to my feet and it's a nonprofit that does something like $6 million a year in Revenue so which is like uh in like corporate sponsors she does that over the course of five years so at the age of 31 she goes to LA and she takes a pilates class so have you ever seen like a reformer pilates it's like this weird like machine where it's kind of like yoga on a machine sort of it's heard I've never done one but I've heard it's like incredibly challenging it's awesome there they're they're really awesome it's mostly what women do and but after talking to an I'm actually going to start doing it because it sounds pretty great and she goes to this class and she was like a pretty intense Runner and I think she did weightlifting and she kind of got was like I get hurt every six months I just I just expect that that's part of the process of being an athlete she starts doing these classes and she's like this is awesome and the class was really cute and darling whatever and she was like I want to do this and so up until that point she had saved $175,000 and so she she moves back goes back to her hometown of Washington DC and she goes I want to start a studio and I'm going to retire from my nonprofit which a lot of people call they're crazy because they're like why do you want to start like a gym like gyms suck they're horrible businesses she's like no no no we're going to do a studio business so she quits her job I believe in August and by November she started her Studio she started with $175,000 she said she transferred her $175,000 in savings put all of it into the business account and spent basically all of it except for 10 grand over months building out the studio and so she launches it and solid core that's the name of the business it's like that Pilates thing but it's kind of has like a Berry's kind of edge to it you know like Barry's boot camp where it's kind of like cool like all black letters the music is just like 40% too loud yeah yeah like it's like it's like in like nightclub yeah yeah yeah it's like cool and she starts this thing and in month one does $9,000 in revenue and the reason she started it was she was just doing the math she's like look like the way that this business can work is I have my Pilates instructor I don't even need like a front desk person the front desk person doesn't need to be there because we have classes going throughout the day and if I have like 15 of these reformers and I do eight classes a day that adds up to $3,000 a day I think I could fill this up seven days a week and get a 90 grand and she does that in year did she tell you how she did that kind of 90 grand month one was her like how did she get the customers to come to this new new place yeah just like flyers and stuff just like telling all of our friends like it was like super Grassroots and if you do them math it it's it wasn't that crazy I think her math was something like I need 15 people in every class or something like that and it wasn't that crazy and she also was really good at branding so these women would go to these classes and they're like this is awesome I'll see you guys next Tuesday you know what I mean like they wanted to do it over and over and over again so in month one it does $90,000 in Revenue she says that she kept growing it and by year two she goes I was able to pay myself a million dollars in salary she goes this thing took off because because my costs were so low I basically just had to build out the studio which wasn't terribly expensive expensive and I had to build buy these reformers which are like the machines and she's like our cost basis was awesome we we are a very efficient operation and so by year so we're in uh 2013 she launches launched it by year 2016 she has 11 Studios still to this point has not taken any outside funding keeps growing it by in 2020 happens where like everything hits the fan Co happens they have to pause the whole business for a couple years however leading up to that she had taken a little bit of funding and along the way she had taken PE where she took a little bit of money off the table so I think it was something like she was paying herself like $2 million a year but then took off I think she raised $18 million of which six went to her and then she raised another like $20 million and then another 10 went to her and then finally after 10 years she eventually has sold the whole business for some something like $250 million and across all of the rounds she had taken off the table something like $90 million and so This Woman's like crazy successful however the big takeway that I had from this lady and I have never met someone with such a great growth mindset and let me give you an example after I sold my business I was interested in real estate I learned everything about real estate or at least enough to kind of feel confident investing in it I start investing into it and I get scared I real nervous I'm like man I just put down a lot of capital like this isn't exactly working like I thought it would be working like it's not always up to the right and I got bail and I got afraid and I bailed and I've done this many times have you done this where like you learn about something like you'll learn about like let's say Fitness and you're like well if I do this for six months but then you're like in month one and you're like this is never going to work she did not have that I've never met someone like her that trusted the process so much and she would tell people like in year two or three she's like I'm building this business to sell and so we're going to do this and then by year five we're going to be here year eight we're going to be here year 10 I think we're going to get like $200 million and here's an example of what she said when she originally took out she had saved $10 million she bought a piece of land and developed a home in the Dominican Republic for like four million bucks in total sold that property after like two years to Albert phol for like $9 million and I was like that's crazy you did half your net worth uh on this she's like yeah well I just like studied a bunch of experts I read a ton of books and I just like felt like I knew how to do it and I've never met someone who has such faith in the process and I was so inspired by that and now she's got over a hundred million dollar or around hundred million dollars and she's investing in all these interesting deals and she's like yeah well you want to allocate 10% of your portfolio to this this and this because I need a little bit of a high-risk stuff in order to off balance my conservative stuff and that sounds very logical and academically that makes a ton sense but when 10% is $10 million and you're doing $2 million bets or whatever that's a very nerve-wrecking thing but she was so good at dividing her emotion from like her logic side of her brain and trusting the process I was incredibly inspired by this woman you have to follow some of the stuff that this lady has to say she's so interesting also she looks very cool got a cool haircut she's like a walking brand she will kick your ass is the vibe that I get from her she's a very strongl looking uh woman yeah very cool so crazy story I didn't realize how big this was I mean it's crazy there's a fitness chain this big this successful that I just never heard of dude it's even bigger now by the way uh I believe was it KKR I think KKR bought it and now there's rumors that they're gonna try to sell it now for $800 million so her business I guess it's not hers anymore she sold it in 2024 the projected to do 150 million in revenue and 50 million in profit and an on the Pod he was like I have the most profitable Fitness Studio because we do uh we just kept it lean like we just don't have too much excess stuff well just seems like they must have figured something out on the marketing side that's uh they're just not spending a lot on marketing right we should they be like and of course the annoying answer everyone oh I just got a lot of Word of Mouth it's like God damn it word of mouth is like the worst answer to hear because you're like great um nothing I can do about that right like I have to go back to the drawing board and create a more viral concept I have to create a more remarkable concept I have to make my product so much better it's like the the last thing you want to hear as a marketer is yeah it's just really organic it's like saying I I I was genetically blessed uh unfortunately that's how it feels uh to me at least on the other side whenever I hear that well we don't on with the MoneyWise podcast we don't talk too much about like getting customers and all that stuff but we should have her on here because I would I I did like off air I was like how did you do that and she goes I am world class at branding and Community that's what I do I know how to do that I I was built to do that and so she didn't tell me all the tactics but I believe that's how it grew that stupid answer of Word of Mouth but we should actually have her on and ask her all about this she's super fascinating and if you Google her name she um she's very transparent about finances because she's like young women aren't taught this and so I'm just going to like be transparent about this so like she's under talked about she's not talked about a lot I never heard I never heard of her never heard of solicor so super good I'm glad you put her on my radar this is really cool all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

the premise of this there was a Instagram influencer I think his name her name's Amber Lancaster and Amber Lancaster is a Instagram mom she's got you know a million followers or whatever and she had created this group and I think she kind of like created it but she's very hands-off with it it's not like a very calculated thing that she did and so the group is called better than Google and the premise is inside this group is like 177,000 kind of like Millennial moms like her audience people who you know because I was asking my wife I was like what is the group and she's like well it's just a bunch of moms who are like we're all kind of like in our 30s we all want to have a good life be a good mom be a good spouse watch good TV shows be healthy like we just have like a certain set of things we're just trying to have a a certain quality of life and in doing so if you put a bunch of those moms together then they could really help each other out it's better than Google if you ask a question here you're going to get better than Google type of answers here's an example question has anyone found an effective way to get rid of cellulite I'm pretty petite and I work out daily but my leg still has cellulite and it has 30 comments of people discussing how they did or didn't get rid of cellulite 100% it's like a media company it's got juicy content just like clickbait like you know click worthy content but there's no editors there's no writers this is just people's real lives so so a woman went on there and she was saying my husband was cheating on me I found out I confronted him about it he got really defensive and I want to file for a divorce but then over the last few days I noticed he was he knew he like referenced things that were in my private messages like my messages to other people like how is he reading my eye message and then the world's greatest Tex support was in the thread where it was like all right you need to log out of your iCloud you need to do this you need to do this he might have a second iPad that's connected to your thing and that's how he's be able to read this and they really helped her us she's like oh thank you I figured it out there was his iPad and whatever that's how he was reading my messages and so now I can do whatever that's a better answer than you would get if you just Googled the sort of same thing and it's more trusted and trust is the key word here so when I originally came on this drunk ideas thing I was just laughing than Google is just like a you know what a funny way to create a Google competitor it's like what's better than Google machine learning artificial intelligence it's like 10,000 moms who are bored and scrolling on their phone and it's it's kind of true though the wisdom of the crowds is actually uh you know a very strong force and the more I thought about it the more I realized this is actually a really good potential business idea here's why so I've long since had this theory that whenever one thing gets really popular it creates a craving for the opposite so we see this in many ways a classic example of this was Facebook became the biggest social network in the world and Facebook was basically uh photos but it was permanent and public right you would post your albums there everybody could see them and they stayed there forever well as Facebook got more popular it created the need for something like Snapchat where you would have photos that are impermanent and not public private right and so Snapchat succeeded but it wouldn't have succeeded unless Facebook had already shifted the way that culture was working and it almost created a craving in people for the opposite and I think you see that today where the more the world got woke and you know you can't say this and you can't say that and you have to use these pronouns do this do that and then it creates a craving for a character like an Andrew Tate or even a Donald Trump or somebody who's oh he's a straight shooter he's just gonna call it like it is and those people become very popular because they're a counter punch to the way that things are going or the uh the the other strong opposition so similarly I started think about this I said man in an AI World a lot of shit's going to change and if you're going to type into you know a box and it's just going to give you the answer and it's going to scrape the Internet it's just going to give you some generic answer that's going to be big for sure that's there's definitely a market for that but what's the opposite of that what craving does that create and what I realize is it's going to create the craving for almost like the the Old Village wisdom right how how you can get answers from a bunch of humans who you can see their name in face and they can tell you things that are their personal experience rather than generically the right answer and I think that if somebody made an app that was the same premise the better than Google premise and it was a community of you know 10,000 20,000 moms who were going to answer questions that would be a really powerful app I think it would be really addictive because you would get the type of content like the botox question by the way one key thing is you can share anonymously in the groups you go Anonymous and then you post about the infidelity in the marriage and that's that's part of why it works so I think you would need those features but think about how valuable that would be for a second like if I could pick any one customer segment to have like a rabid community of it would be moms like it would be people that control the household budget in America that would be the most valuable audience segment that you could have and I think this is the way to get it do you remember chaaa was that like the old search engine that was kind of like this like a Yahoo answers type of thing yeah so I'm just pulling this up right now now but basically I remember it when I was in high school and so that was about 2008 so it was launched in 2006 it went bankrupt in 2016 and so basically it was a service and I I didn't actually realize any of this but it raised $6 million including from Jeff Bezos and they had 5,000 freelance guides meaning people who they hired and I would send a text message to Chacha I remember this was during the World Cup and I was like testing it out and I was like what's the tallest and what's the shortest player on this particular soccer team because I was just testing it out and I think I paid them two or three cents or something like that and they would message me back in like three minutes with an answer and at the time it was amazing and I'm just reading their their page now it looks like they actually had raised up to $60 million and that and they had something like 1.7 billion questions a month of people that that people were asking and it was like magic back then because we didn't have Google on our phone I didn't have a smartphone and I remember this being amazing and eventually it went out of business because Google's just better but I just don't know if it could ever make any money I think I paid like two cents or something like that a text message well that's that's the beauty of it you don't need to actually pay for an expert answer so so like here's some different analoges to this so you have a Kora which is a bunch of more I would call it tech nerd type of community then you have GLG which is highly paid intellectual information right and there's a different customer for that for the customer for that is going to be a hedge fund or uh some sort of investment Baker or something something like that and then you have Google which is the general search and you know Google's market cap today is I think 2.3 trillion and if you think about like search on the internet so the big the general search on the internet Google was 2.3 trillion and then you can like Silo that into different things like searching for restaurants it's like Yelp and I don't know what yelp's market cap is I mean it's billions but it just hasn't grown in years two billion right so you know the search for restaurants and handymen in your area became two billion out of the two trillion and then glass door which was like search for you know good places to work and and then you have search for jobs and then you have search for whatever and there's a thousand tiny search engines and these are all like single digigit billions companies for the most part that got created and so I think and then we have Duck Duck Go which is kind of like the uh for the you know Tech SA person who cares about privacy and likes to not be doing the mainstream thing here's Duck Duck Go and we've talked about them before about how much insane amount of traffic that they have so I think that while search and this kind of question answer thing feels like a solved problem um and even the kind of community questions and answers like you would think well why not Kora why not Reddit dude my wife is not getting on quora and reddit reddit is just like it repels women like dude isn't it funny how Reddit works so Reddit is I don't remember what they are now but two years ago they are like the sixth or seventh most popular website and yet if you asked people do they use Reddit a very common answer was like what's Reddit it's a very strange thing I love Reddit by the way I use like I too it's made for dorks like us right made guys with body odor right it's not made for the millennial mom who wants to go in a high trust place and not get trolled and not get spammed and not get like you know made fun of and not like she doesn't get all the weird memes they kind of like it's just different it's a different culture and so I think that this kind of Reddit for Mom's uh angle which you you couldn't really if you had pitched me that generically I wouldn't believe it as soon as I saw better than Google I thought man if somebody really created an App that's supposed to do this and they seated it correctly the what the beauty of this was it was seated with only followers of a certain type of of Instagram influencer which created a like-minded community of of of members and it excluded the general trolls of the internet if you could find a way to do that again I think that thing would scale and I think that thing would be really really valuable the value per user would be really really high all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

Sam I want to start with an idea today I have an idea that I genuinely believe is going to be big if somebody does it I've tried to convince one of my smartest friends to do this but they're already a little too rich and too happy to to go try something new so I putting this out there to the universe if anybody does this more power to [Music] you the funny thing about this idea is that it's started off on one of our drunk idea episodes which we do from time to time where we take like I don't know half-baked ideas kind of bad ideas but maybe there's a nugget in there that's interesting and we call it drunk ideas where we we both get a little tipsy we pretend to be at least and we we pitch each other ideas what was the drunk idea so the drunk idea was called better than Google do you remember this one is that the Facebook group it's the Facebook group I joined it I love it IED it yes I love it they didn't they didn't accept my request oh man I I'm sitting here pending still so like here's an example uh yesterday there was this woman who like wasn't that pretty and she was like 23 years old and she was like can I or should I get BOTOX now will I look prettier and she posted her face and there was like all these very positive not necessarily positive like you do or do not need it but like you know we're not going to make fun of you but here's the pros and cons the premise of this there back up a second there was a Instagram influencer I think his name her name's Amber Lancaster and Amber Lancaster is a Instagram mom she's got you know a million followers or whatever and she had created this group and I think she kind of like created it but she's very hands-off with it it's not like a very calculated thing that she did and so the group is called better than Google and the premise is inside this group is like 17,000 kind of like Millennial mobs like moms like her audience people who you know because I was asking my wife I was like what is the group and she's like well it's just a bunch of moms who are like we're all kind of like in our 30s we all want to have a good life be a good mom be a good spouse watch good TV shows be healthy like we just have like a certain set of things we're just trying to have a a certain quality of life and in doing so if you put a bunch of those moms together then they could really help each other out it's better than Google if you ask a question here you're going to get better than Google type of answers here's an example question has anyone found an effective way to get rid of cellulite I'm pretty petite and I work out daily but my leg still has cellulite and it has 30 comments of people discussing how they did or didn't get rid of cellulite 100% it's like a media company it's got juicy content just like clickbait like you know click worthy content but there's no editors there's no writers this is just people's real lives so so a woman went on there and she was saying my husband was cheating on me I found out I confronted him about it he got really defensive and I want to file for a divorce but then over the last few days I noticed he was he knew he like referenced things that were in my private messages like my messages to other people like how is he reading my iMessage and then the world's greatest tech support was in the thread where it was like all right you need to log out of your iCloud you need to do this you need to do this he might have a second iPad that's connected to your thing and that's how he's being able to read this and they really helped her out she's like oh thank you I figured it out there was his iPad and whatever that's how he was reading my messages and so now I can do whatever that's a better answer than you would get if you just Googled the sort of same thing and it's more trusted and trust is the key word here so when I originally came on this drunk ideas thing I was just laughing better than Google it's just like a you know what a funny way to create a Google competitor it's like what's better than Google machine learning artificial intelligence it's like 10,000 moms who are bored and scrolling on their phone and it's it's kind of true though the wisdom of the crowds is actually uh you know a very strong force and the more I thought about it the more I realize this is actually a really good potential business idea here's why so I've long since had this theory that whenever one thing gets really popular it creates a craving for the opposite so we see this in many ways I classic example of this was Facebook became the biggest social network in the world and Facebook was basically uh photos but it was permanent and public right you would post your albums there everybody could see them and they stayed there forever well as Facebook got more popular it created the need for something like Snapchat where you would have photos that are impermanent and not public private right and so Snapchat succeeded but it wouldn't have succeeded unless Facebook had already shifted the way that culture was working and it almost created the craving in people for the opposite and I think you see that today where the more the world got woke and you know you can't say this and you can't say that and you have to use these pronouns do this do that and then it creates a craving for a character like an Andrew Tate or even a Donald Trump or somebody who's oh he's a straight shooter he's just gonna call it like it is and those people become very popular because they're a counterpunch to the way that things are going or the uh the the other strong opposition so similarly I started to thinking about this I said man an AI World a lot of shit's going to change and if you're going to just type into you know a box and it's just going to give you the answer and it's going to scrape the Internet it's just going to give you some generic answer that's going to be big for sure there there's definitely a market for that but what's the opposite of that what craving does that create and what I realize is it's going to create the craving for almost like the the Old Village wisdom right how how you can get answers from a bunch of humans who you can see their name in face and they can tell you things that are their personal experience rather than generically the right answer and I think that if somebody made an app that was the same premise the better than Google premise and it was a community of you know 10,000 20,000 moms who were going to answer questions that would be a really powerful app I think it would be really addictive because you would get the type of content like the botox question by the way one key thing is you can share anonymously in the groups you go Anonymous and then you post about the infidelity in the marriage and that's that's part of why it works so I think you would need those features but think about how valuable that would be for a second like if I could pick any one customer segment to have like a rabid community of it would be moms like it would be people that control the household budget in America that would be the most valuable audience segment that you could have and I think this is the way to get it do you remember chaa chaa was that like the old search engine that was kind of like this like Yahoo answers type of thing yeah so I'm just pulling this up right now but basically I remember it when I was in school and so that was about 2008 so it was launched in 2006 it went bankrupt in 2016 and so basically it was a service and I I didn't actually realize any of

so you have a Kora which is a bunch of more I would call a tech nerd type of community then you have GLG which is highly paid intellectual information right and there's a different customer for that

Instagram influencer which created a like-minded community of of of members and it excluded the general trolls of the internet if you could find a way to do that again I think that thing would scale and I think that thing would be really really valuable the value per user would be really really high all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that one can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show let me play the the pessimistic person right now are you gonna Devil's avocado me yeah I'm a devil's avocado you I've built a handful of things and one of the hardest things that I've tried to do that I've not been able to pull off is getting people so like I I own fa I own a variety of Facebook groups some of them have 880,000 there's one or two that most of them have like two or three or 5,000 one has like 880,000 get and when we started them I wanted to do Facebook group because Facebook is where the person already was when I when I started a lot of these it was like 201415 and my reasoning was that getting someone to go specifically to a we site like uh for example let's just say that you had like uh a food uh recipe website and then they're like well let's just create a a community for our readers to talk so getting people to go to myrecipes.com forum and to actively participate is one of the hardest things that I've ever had to do and I've I've never actually pulled it off and so I think there are people who do know how to pull it off I think they're those people are rare getting getting people to come to a destination to type new content and to register for something that is one of the hardest things to figure out I think when it comes to mostly internet based companies I agree uh I'm not saying it's easy I'm just saying I think there's a billion dollar idea here but like most billion dollar ideas it requires threading the needle I'll give you one other analog to this so in terms of shopping you have the big retailers I could go to you know target.com I could go to macy's.com whatever and then Amazon came out and Amazon was like cool we'll just aggregate all the products and Amazon's the the Google of that space right it's the general shopping search then there's Etsy and Etsy is like a complete counter to Amazon it's never going to be bigger than Amazon it's always going to be some tiny fraction of Amazon but a tiny fraction of a giant number is still a pretty damn big number and what Etsy did was they were like cool we will do basically moms buying from other moms so how do we do handcrafted Goods how do we do things that are personalized kind of the non-scalable non-generic products only and um you could see the maker here she is you could trust her she's got a you know her little shop and so let anybody create a little shop and sell to other people who like to shop kind of that same like you know flea market type of uh Vibe and Etsy totally succeeded because it was so different and I think in a world that's going in a hyper fast speed towards AI just tells you the answer it's hyper intelligent this is generically the answer for things I think it's going to create more than ever the the desire for more of the Etsy feel where it's like yeah cool but what if I just wanted hundred other people like me who might have been through something like this to tell me their recommendations so another thing that's really popular in this group will be like hey I got like an Amazon gift card what are your best best finds on Amazon for me here's my waist size here's my my chest size here's whatever like what will fit me well and they'll just be like oh here's really good Amazon finds that are like clothes that are actually like pretty good fitting and actually going to last long but are still good on a budget how are you seeing the stuff are you like hey wife give me your phone and like you scroll on hers or she like saying like oh heyck she show me things right so first it was her showing me and me being like swatting away the phone like I don't care who cares about this like and she's like no like this lady was looking for somebody and then she asked the group and then the group found that person that she had bumped into at the bus stop it was crazy they knew it because of the description of the shirt that he wears and somebody said wait I think I know that guy and I'm like all right whatever who cares about this story and then the fourth or fifth time I was like okay every time I've paid attention to what my wife is really into I'm like early to something that's actually like a very valuable investment what's another example of that I mean the the Ecom brand that I started was was very much in this uh this vein but in general there's like this is not new like Stanley mugs right Stanley mugs now are like all the rage and like two years ago she just kept talking about this and like kept being so excited and wanting to show me about this like jumbo oversized overexp mug that she bought but this is like one of like a thousand examples of these types of things and so yeah anyways this this type of stuff I I've learned that I should not ignore because she is really high signal when it comes to she's a consumer and she's a specific type of consumer that is the opposite of me right I am like an internet native person I I'm the early adopter of products she's the opposite but the things that do kind of pass her filter there's something there are you still us is your wife the same way by the way like is that a signal for you no no it's not why is that I mean my wife is uh a young Millennial or an old gen Z I guess she's uh 31 and so typically it's with like ticktock Trend so like for example remember the hawk tuy thing like I I had to be like dude what the hell is this about like what is this thing she's like your Urban Dictionary yeah if it's like there's some new like singer named like Charlie X some she's like so This Woman's going to be like a a huge deal uh and I'm like why she's like well just all my friends are talking about it and it's popular on Tik Tok and so she we we do it like that so no but not like business stuff like you know like those Golden Goose shoes do you know those shoes those are so stupid like like [ __ ] dirty shoes that are $700 those are so dumb it was like really early on that too on that train and then like uh no cuz she's vegan so that was like another thing that she was vegan like a lot like a lot earlier before the plant-base became like a bigger deal and so I used to be like okay uh you know great high maintenance uh where do we find like milk or butter or like any of the things that you need to do stuff and she would find these Niche Brands she' be like oh I really love Oatley oley's really great this was before Oley was like in coffee shops and all that stuff and O was this it's this brand that's like I don't know it's like a Swedish brand or something something in in Europe and nobody ever heard of it it's got this funky bottle and I remember you know whatever like seven years ago and she was showing me all these plant-based products and then these creator who were really small at the time but they were plant-based creators that are now all huge because plant-based recipes became very popular another version of this was Kayla iin who we talked about on here I don't even know how you say your last name but she's like the fitness influencer yeah so when I was like hey do you want to like do like I don't know like uh like should we get a trainer let work out together my wife was doing that [ __ ] too did she buy the PDF first she bought the PDF I'm like you're using a PDF to work out she's like yeah it's great and I'm like a PDF you paid for a PDF you don't pay for anything and she's like I just really trust her I'm like who is this random woman in Australia like who is this person and then sure enough she then creates the sweat app sweat app then becomes like a multi hundred million dollar app and again I was kind of like dude why are you pay this random Instagram influencer like she's not even like a real trainer like why don't you watch these videos or why don't you go to this this official certified thing but no her trust was in a certain type of person and I kind of wrote that off but then later I learned like actually that's just the way the world is going that's where people are going to get their information that's where people are going to get their trust from in kind of noisier noisier world Sarah was like that with me with em Emma Chamberlain do you watch Emma Chamberlain I I don't but I know about her dude this woman is the best I'm like she's like Casey neistat for chicks and I'm like going back and like watching all of her old stuff she's so darling like I'm all about it um by the way uh are you still using open AI every day as a search engine yeah not just as a search engine can I tell you about a crazy thing that I did with open AI chat GPT basically yeah what this like nobody else is going to care about this but I think uh whatever I give a [ __ ] and I I think you will find this interesting too so I've been playing around with the idea of writing a a movie and so I was but I've never done I've never made a movie before not a filmmaker do a play do a play Never a script never written a screen play I thought about play but I had a specific idea for a movie there's a movie that there's a book that I wanted to buy the rights to to turn into a movie and so I've been like down this Rabbit Hole trying to do that do I know what book it is you don't don't say it but do I know what it is yeah I can't say it but yes you you would definitely know it and it's like the rights of bounced around from Big Studio to Big studio and it just never got made for one reason or another oh co happens and then production dies or oh this this person's on board and then they get cancelled and that the project stalls out and I'm like I can't believe this has not been turned into a movie yet and so um so anyways I'm in this like really like interesting path right now where I'm trying to acquire the rights to like create a movie but along the way I was like hey maybe I should like figure out how movies are even made and like how this works so aside from like normal chat GPT stuff where I'm like how do movies get made what's the name of the person who doesn't know how to do anything but provides the money and the the will to make it happen they're like that's called an executive producer and like I had a a kind of amazing magical experience with chat GPT so here's what happened I've used chat GPT to um like question and answer I don't know this tell me do this or explain this to me what I hadn't used it for was as kind of a creative assistant uh have you ever used it in that way or can should I describe what I mean by that yeah yeah like sometimes what I'll do is I'll upload like I use the I'll download I I got this uh tool where like for example Scott Galloway I love his writing he's got a 100 blog posts I got this tool where it downloaded in PDF all of his blog posts I uploaded it all to chat gbt I called The Voice Scott I'll write something I'll say rewrite it in Scott's voice and I won't use the whole thing but I'll just one or two nuggets I'm like that's a cool sentence I'm gonna be inspired by that so I'll use it a little bit like that yeah that's sick and so I did the same thing and I was like you know who I love I love Aon sorin uh Aon sorin wrote You Know The Social Network and westwing and Newsroom and a bunch of cool things he's known for his like Snappy fast-paced dialogue that's witty and specifically there's like a bunch of like really nuanced things he does where one character says something to the other the like let's say in the the be the beginning scene of The Social Network so the beginning scene is Zuck talking to some girl he's on a date with did you know there are more people with genius IQs living in China than there are people of any kind living in the United States that can't possibly be true it is account for that well first an awful lot of people live in China but here's my question how do you distinguish yourself in a population of people who all got 1,600 on their SATs I didn't know they take SATs in China they don't I wasn't talking about China anymore I was talking about me you got A600 yes I could sing in the OA Pell but I can't s does that me you actually got nothing wrong crew or invent a $25 PC or you get into a final club or I get into a final Club you know from a woman's perspective sometimes not singing in an aqu capella group is a good thing this is serious on the other hand I do like guys who rot crew well I can't do that I was kidding yes I got nothing wrong in the test have you ever tried I'm trying right now to R crew to get into a final Club to R crew no are you like whatever delusional maybe it's just sometimes you say two things at once I'm not sure which one I'm supposed to be aiming at but you've seen guys who were crew right it's an awesome first scene she's still catching up on the SATs in China but he's like moved to the next part and it creates these little misunderstandings this little bit of tension and it's part of why the dialogue really keeps you because it doesn't feel rehearsed it feels genuinely like two people kind of a quick rally conversational rally with the ball back and forth it makes a non fastpac scene feel fastpac exactly the whole scene is like seven minutes or something long it's a long scene which is a long time in a movie for just two characters just be talking to each other that's usually like breaks a rule of film where you want to break it up with action and movement and all these other things to keep people's attention but he doesn't do that anyway so I upload that scene and I say here's the screenplay for that how did you upload it you upload the screen play it turns out all movie scripts are like available online like the actual original script is just there uh online so I go grab the PDF I put it into Chad I say you're my creative assistant we're writing a scene for this movie here's the situation two characters and let's put them in a whatever coffee shop all right first I said explain to me what makes Aon sorin's dialogue so good in this first scene and then it explains it I Sayre using those characteristics write a new scene for this and what it did was so it spits out a scene and the scene kind of sucks but it spits it out instantly and so like there's this trade between speed and quality and even though the quality was quite bad the speed was incredible it would like took two seconds so then I could just start to inch up the quality by giving it feedback and so that I'm like cool but I don't think it's believable that the character would say this for the first line I think it should do this and then it goes sure I've taken your suggestions wrote it again I said okay cool but like maybe instead of coffee shop put it in a in a restaurant and uh changes the restaurant because I want the waitress to say this and then it does it again I say cool but give me an alternative just like no not that bad I don't really know why just give me another alternative it gives me another alternative and I say okay cool but make it faster and snappier and actually I want the one character to be a little bit of an [ __ ] try does it again and I what I realized was I was doing this and I just kind of Step stepped back for a second I said wow this is amazing it's what do I have here I have a OnDemand creative collaborator it was 1:00 am when I was doing this I could have called somebody and be like hey do you want to just wake up real quick and just uh start writing with me so in the moment inspiration struck I was able to like instantly have a genius creative collaborator Who had who spit out instant first drafts which let me not have to have the blank page which is the biggest enemy to any Creator right instead of being the author I got to be the editor so now chap gbt is the author I'm just the editor who's like no something else uh try again tweet this a little bit this way give me another variation with this happening and it would instantly instantly give me another one back and I thought wow the difference here would be let's say I had a human doing this a they wouldn't have been online let's say they let's say I caught them the next day when inspiration was half as much as it was in the middle of the the night there then I would say can you write a draft of this that would have taken a week then they would have come to me after a week again my my I'm out of flow I'm now worried about 10 other things in life and then they would have given it to me and now I would have to as you say bubble wrap it for them I'd have to give them feedback but I kept bruise their ego they just worked so hard all week giving me exactly what I asked for so now I have to say hey I really like part of it but I just think maybe we could like would you be okay if we tried something like this not to say this is bad but I just want to try just for you know and I'd have to do all that and then I'd bubble wrap it and then I'd give them the advice then it take another week to get the second draft and now on the second draft I have to give half as much feedback because if I really push it even further or if I say nope still try again bruised egos so I'm like wow you have a on demand creative assistant who can instantly mimic and learn from any input I give it like write this in the style of this write this in the sty of this pretend this person is a director has no ego takes feedback instantaneously and creates the revisions instantaneously and by the end of it I actually had a dope scene that was written a dope opening scene to a movie and I'm a guy who's never written a screenplay before for me to have done that without AI would have been I don't know a hundred times harder so I thought that was pretty cool how was the output the final product the final product is pretty good it's like I mean of course it's not you know Aon toin but like it's a hell of a lot better than Shawn so you know I I got a superpow to be able to do that and I would say it is on par with like the average or slightly above average from a a professional who I would have paid tens of thousands of dollars to write me a script man that's like I guess when I watch a movie I kind of take for granted that someone had to sit down and write all that crap out that's so much work like that's so much work and that would be so much when and so when we tell that story of Sylvester Salone doing how fast did he do Rocky he wrote the first draft and a half days that's insane to me that's insane but also if you watch Rocky you're like okay this is not rocket science the script is not like super sophisticated either it's still a lot you're making a whole world but let me tell you two other things so on that note so you had um so writing the thing that the the other cool thing I got out of it you know when I wasn't writing I was watching like videos of Erin s talking about his process and one of the things he says is he's like people don't understand to get one good idea he's like my brain is a Rolodex flipping through 50 thousand bad ideas and he's like I have just exhausted so many deadend paths that this could have gone to find the One path that kind of works and I thought that's such a good analogy for how all creation works I'm sure you feel the same way about marketing ideas or business ideas like your brain flips through 50,000 permutations of what you could work on and how it could work what the business model could be and then in the end it pops out and it's like oh Hampton's a great idea dude you know like congrats it seems like it just worked right away it's like yeah it worked right away because my brain went through the idea made on a speedrun and I bumped into so many walls and I flipped through so many ideas and permutations of what this could and could not have been until I finally figured out one that that would work yeah and it's like magic how it comes out and it's crazy that the you know we talk about the uh shower thoughts and it's like it is weird how I spend so much time thinking about something and all the permutations and then when I'm out on a bike ride it just like wait why didn't I think of that you know it just kind of all it is like a magical process and if I had to do that for a script for money that would be very hard um do we have to do a show real quick yeah let's do it speaking of writing speaking of writing speaking of writing if you're trying to get your writing out there the way that Sam did it the way that I did it the two businesses that we built that we sold and and uh probably I don't know some of the the simpler easier would you say simp the simpler easier businesses that we ever made the simplest the simplest was a newsletter business and if you're going to do a newsletter business back when we started it well back when you started the hustle for sure you built a bunch of things three Engineers on staff I had three Engineers on staff and we had to build everything and then I had like two or three growth people and they spent half of their time filling out Excel sheets to try to just track all the information right or build a referral program or uh you know go and then you had 20 people in ad sales right like going just try to generate Revenue oh you have we have uh I think we had like 15 people in ad sales and then we had like three people supporting them all just so we basically when we sold the company we we were going to do about $20 million that year in revenue and we had something like 35 people but only two writers and it was insane it was insane like it was actually only two Riders one rider was just in case the first Rider got sick B yes it was 1500 words a days it it was not that hard and so we had to build all of these tools it was a pain in the ass let's do a little bit of math on this just real quick so do you remember what your Opex your payroll cost roughly were for writing that one newsletter that had two writers but had 18 you know had 33 other people in the company we're doing all the other functions so two Riders probably each made 150 so add about 20% to that for healthcare so we'll just Round Up to $200,000 so $200,000 for three Riders is $600,000 and then we had roughly 30 people Beyond those guys so what's that like eight million yeah something like that so eight million bucks and just even just the engineers part right because I remember you were building like a tool that would segment the audience you were building an AB testing tool you were building all these little features to to be better at your newsletter you lived in San Francisco at the time a San Francisco engineer even with the S par special Scrappy find somebody convince that this is the dream 200 Grand each right so you're paying basically 600 Grand just on product cost and the products weren't even that good like you know like I'm not a tech company but I had it was hard not your cor competency well instead how much does beehive cost a month I think beehive is like 99 bucks a month or something like that and they got like a free plan too and so instead of spending 600,000 a year you could have spent $39 a month that's the that's the price of the most popular plan the scale plan and with that you get the ad Network so they'll they'll do your ad sales for you you get subscriptions so you put a pay wall in and you can actually do subscriptions you didn't have to build that feature you get a website builder you get all the email automation so that when somebody signs up you know 60 minutes later you send them this and one day later you send them this and then after they refer a friend it automatically sends them this you have the referral program which was huge for you huge for us and required basically like one and a half to two people to run on our side you you didn't have an engineer did you we didn't have an engineer because beehive was out when we started the milk road so we just used beehive but half of these features didn't exist when we did the milk road so I remember when we were building it we were like hey do you have this automations feature do you have analytics that will do this this and this do you have surveys or polls so at the bottom of the email we would always write how was it and it was five stars three stars or one star and we use that to basically give feedback to the writers on like what worked what didn't um in each newsletter and we could actually measure the quality of the writing the quality of the of the content and now they have all those features so if you want to do a newsletter today no-brainer use beehive it's beehive.org um all right let me tell you a quick story about someone who I spoke with the other day and it was kind of a life-changing conversation so for Hampton we have this podcast called MoneyWise where we get people to come on and they explain all their finances whatever Spill the Beans about the beans you know what I mean yeah I'm stealing that one thank you that one's now mine uh and they like break down their whole portfolio whatever but this woman I talked to have you heard of this company called solid core no I've been described as that person but never at company level I bet your wife has heard of it so her name's Anne malum so an is probably 41 right now and so let me tell you her story because this was like mindboggling to me so an started uh her career at the age of 25 she started a nonprofit because she was out in a run and she ran by a homeless shelter and she was like you know I would love to figure out a way to help these people running has helped me get over a lot of issues in my life I should start a running club for these guys and if I make them get up or if I encourage them to get up early at 7 a.m. to come to this run maybe that's going to encourage them to make the rest of their day better and hopefully they'll get jobs whatever so she starts this thing called back to my feet and it's a nonprofit that does something like $6 million a year in Revenue so which is like uh in like corporate sponsors she does that over the course of 5 years so at the age of 31 she goes to LA and she takes a pilates class so have you ever seen like a reformer pilates it's like this weird like machine where it's kind of like yoga on a machine sort of it's I've heard I've never done one but I've heard it's like incredibly challenging it's awesome they're they're they're really awesome it's mostly what women do and but after talking to an I'm actually going to start doing it because it sounds pretty great and she's goes to this class and she's like a pretty intense Runner and I think she did weightlifting and she kind of got was like I get every six months I just I just expect that that's part of the process of being an athlete she starts doing these classes and she's like this is awesome and the class was really cute and darling whatever and she was like I want to do this and so up until that point she had saved $175,000 and so she moves back goes back to her hometown of Washington DC and she goes I want to start a studio and I'm going to retire from my nonprofit which a lot of people called they're crazy because they're like why do you want to start like a gym like gyms suck they're horrible businesses she's like no no no we're going to to do a studio business so she quits her job I believe in August and by November she started her Studio she started with $175,000 she said she transferred her $175,000 in savings put all of it into the business account and spent basically all of it except for 10 grand over two months building out the studio and so she launches it and solid core that's the name of the business it's like that Pilates thing but it's kind of has like a berri's kind of edge to it you know like Berry's boot camp where it's kind of like cool like all black letters the music is just like 40% too loud yeah yeah like it's like it's like int like a nightclub yeah yeah it's like cool and she starts this thing and in month one does $90,000 in revenue and the reason she started it was she was just doing the math she's like look like the way that this business can work is I have my Pilates instructor I don't even need like a front desk person the front desk person doesn't need to be there because we have classes going throughout the day and if I have like 15 of these reformers and I do eight classes a day that adds up to $3,000 a day I think I could fill this up seven days a week and get to 90 grand and she does that in year did she tell you how she did that kind of 90 grand month one was there like how did she get the customers to come to this new new place yeah just like flyers and stuff just like telling all her friends like it was like super Grassroots and if you do the math it it's it wasn't that crazy I think her math was something like I need 15 people in every class or something like that and it wasn't that crazy and she also was really good at branding so these women would go to these classes and they're like this is aw awesome I'll see you guys next Tuesday you know what I mean like they wanted to do it over and over and over again so in month one it does $90,000 in Revenue she says that she kept growing it and by year two she goes I was able to pay myself a million dollars in salary she goes this thing took off because my costs were so low I basically just had to build out the studio which wasn't terribly expensive expensive and I had to build buy these reformers which are like the machines and she's like our cost basis was awesome we we a very efficient operation and so by year so we're in uh 2013 she launches launched it by year 2016 she has 11 Studios still to this point has not taken any outside funding keeps growing it by in 2020 [ __ ] happens where like everything hits the fan Co happens they have to pause the whole business for a couple years however leading up to that she had taken a little bit of funding and along the way she had taken PE where she took a little bit of money off the table so I think it was something like she was paying herself like $2 million a year but then took off I think she raised $18 million of which six went to her and then she raised another like $20 million and then another 10 went to her and then finally after 10 years she eventually has sold the whole business for something like $250 million and across all of the rounds she had taken off the table something like $90 million and so This Woman's like crazy successful however the big takeaway that I had from this lady and I have never met someone with such a great growth mindset and let me give you an example after I sold my business I was interested in real estate I learned everything about real estate or at least enough to kind of feel confident investing in it I start investing into it and I get scared I got real nervous I'm like man I just put down a lot of capital like this isn't exactly working like I thought it would be working like it's not always up to the right and I got bail and I got afraid and I bailed and I've done this many times have you done this where like you learn about something like you'll learn about like let's say Fitness and you're like well if I do this for six months but then you're like in month one and you're like this is never going to work she did not have that I've never met someone like her that trusted the process so much and she would tell people like in year two or three she's like I'm building this business to sell and so we're going to do this and then by year five we're GNA be here year eight we're going to be here year 10 I think we're going to get like $200 million and here's an example of what she said when she originally took out she had saved $10 million she bought a piece of land and developed a home in the Dominican Republic for like 4 million bucks in total sold that property after like 2 years to Albert poolz for like $9 million and I was like that's crazy you did half your net worth uh on this she's like yeah well I just like studied a bunch of experts I read a ton of books and I just like felt like I knew how to do it and I've never met someone who has such faith in the process and I was so inspired by that and now she's got over 100 million ion or around $100 million and she's investing in all these interesting deals and she's like yeah well you want to allocate 10% of your portfolio to this this and this because I need a little bit of a high-risk stuff in order to off balance my conservative stuff and that sounds very logical and academically that makes a ton of sense but when 10% is $10 million and you're doing $2 million bets or whatever that's a very nerve-wracking thing but she was so good at dividing her emotion from like her logic side of her brain and trusting the process I was incredibly inspired by this woman you have to follow some of the stuff that this lady has to say she's so interesting also she looks very cool got a cool haircut she's like a walking brand she will kick your ass is the vibe that I get from her she's a very strongl looking uh woman yeah very cool so crazy story I didn't realize how big this was I mean it's crazy there's a fitness chain this big this successful that I just never heard of dude it's even bigger now by the way uh I believe what's it KKR I think KKR bought it and now there's rumors that they're going to try to sell it now for $800 million so her business I guess it's not hers anymore she sold it in 2024 the projected to do 150 million in revenue and 50 million in profit and an on the Pod she was like I have the most profitable Fitness Studio because we do uh we just kept it lean like we just don't have too much excess stuff well it just seems like they must have figured something out on the marketing side that's uh they're just not spending a lot of M marketing right we should they'll be like and of course the annoying answer everyone oh I just got a lot of Word of Mouth it's like God damn it word of mouth is like the worst answer to hear because you're like great um nothing I can do about that right like I have to go back to the drawing board and create a more viral concept I have to create a a more remarkable concept I have to make my product so much better it's like the the last thing you want to hear as a marketer is yeah it's just really organic it's like saying I I I was genetically blessed uh unfortunately that's how it feels to me at least on the other side whenever I hear that well we don't on with the MoneyWise podcast we don't talk too much about like getting customers and all that stuff but we should have her on here because I would I I did like off air I was like how did you do that and she goes I am world class at branding and Community that's what I do I know how to do that I I was built to do that and so she didn't tell me all the tactics but I believe that's how it grew that stupid answer of Word of Mouth but we should actually have her on and ask her all about this she's super fascinating and if you Google her name she um she's very transparent about finances because she's like young women aren't taught this and so I'm just going to like be transparent about this so like she's under talked about she's not talked about a lot I never heard I never heard of her never heard of solicor so super good I'm glad you put her on my radar this is really cool the question I have is it seems like your takeaway was I've never seen somebody have so much what did you say like so much Faith or what did you call it like first you said growth mindset then you said trust the process but okay the business made $95,000 the first month the process was trusted what do you have to trust it's working right away like to me trust the process is it's not working it's not working it's not working it's not working and then month 29 it finally turns the corner that's trust the process but that's not how people truly feel in reality so like with my with the hustle when we were doing when we cross a million dollars a month I still felt like fairly uncertain if you talk to uh I mean I talked to you talked to a lot of people I talked to a lot of people like you could have a big business and you're still like it's still tatering I don't know if this is going to work out you know what I mean you still have you you still kept going it's not like you abandoned ship right so I think it's pretty even if you have doubts doubts to me of course you're going to have random doubts that creep in or you're going to have some uncertainty will you know will this work if it starts working will this last those are natural questions I I guess like uh I think a lot of what she did is awesome and in fact the first thing you said about having a growth mindset to me made a lot of sense as in she just had had the confidence and faith in herself to go do something completely different put her entire life savings into it and trusted in herself that she would make this work I think maybe that's more what you mean no I mean that and like when I was asking her about new initiatives and things that she would get into like she was like well I wanted to learn a little bit about Stock Investing and like so I started I studied all the earnings per share and I learned what all that meant and like I bought Nvidia a while ago and it worked out and so I guess what I mean is she was quite good at acquiring information and then trusting that that information was good and trusting that the way she learned was good and trusting that the process that she learned about would give the outcome that hopefully she wanted okay that makes more sense to me okay yeah I like that in fact I had a kind of similar idea so I'm writing this essay by the way you you had this in one of your emails your uh uh what's it called Tuesday Tuesday yeah where that guy Hoffman his last name was Hoffman um where he said something like no good business is a good business or what did he say Orin Hoffman yeah he basically was like got the exact wording of the Tweet but it was every business looks like a [ __ ] show on the inside the successful ones and the unsuccessful ones right when you I think he said there's no such thing as a good business on the inside yeah every business looks incredibly messy and like upside down on the inside and I found that that's true at least in my experience like I've never been a part of a company where I'm like wow it feels buttoned up it feels figured out it feels like this is just firing in all cylinders this is just a well-oiled machine you didn't feel that way with twitch dude no twitch was twitch honestly and this is g to sound a little bit bad but you know when when Twitter started getting big and suck came out and it was a little bit of jealousy or hater aid but he was like they drove a clown car into a gold mine that was twitch wait Z said that yeah you never heard this no that's awesome it's one of the one of the first non-politically correct things he ever said which is like just the honest thing which is these guys are driving they drove a clown car into a gold mine and twitch very much was the same way which was twitch could get a 100 things wrong internally but it didn't matter because they had a network effect they had a moat and they had basically once you build a marketpl once you get a Marketplace to work you can now screw up so many things and they just got more popular as gaming grew so it was like I would see just [ __ ] going on internally just wasted wasted efforts here wasted efforts here bad strategy here and then Co it happens and everybody's at home playing video games online boom business takes off and you see you know we're trying this thing to create growth trying trying this to create growth nothing is even working nobody has any [ __ ] clue how to grow this thing fortnite becomes the biggest game in the world played by everybody and twitch grows like crazy on top of fortnite because what EMT and the team had done early on they got right and even then probably I'm sure I wasn't there but I'm sure many things felt broken or unfigured out at that time but they got the core thing right which is they created the biggest Market place of supply and demand of content creators for video gaming content and consumers and that gave them the the the privilege the right to be wrong so they got to fire so many shots on goal after that that didn't even have to work out didn't have to be well executed because the more popular gaming got the more people were online stream you know online uh being content creators the bigger twitch got and and so they were just then the analogy we used inter internally was we don't create the waves right when every time somebody did the growth analysis it's like all the things that caused growth were not out were exogenous factors it was not some feature we created that drove growth necessarily it was the popularity of a specific game or it was a new device gets released and now the new PlayStation drives you know a big boost in whatever or the new gaming PCs or the chips get better which make it easier to stream while you're playing because the graphics cards can now handle both and so there was always these exogenous things in the analogy we used internally was we're we are the surfer we are out there paddling waiting for waves and when the w comes it's our job to be ready to Surf it and not wipe out but let's be clear we don't create the waves and internally we all wanted to create the wave because you want growth to be a button you can push but in that business that's just not how it worked and by the way a twitch di hard person would totally disagree I'm sure they would be you know shaking their fist saying no no no we we were great internally and you know we improved the conversion rate and the discovery rate and the retention rates and that that all causes growth so there is like a counter argument to it but I think on the ho I know what I saw I I I know what was going on inside of there it's not like I by the way that's what I thought I would find I thought I would go from my messy startup where I'm an idiot and I created a huge mess over here and I got 20 people and I don't know how to do anything oh I'm gonna go to this company that got bought by Amazon it's a multi-billion dollar company with seasoned Executives now I'll go learn how a business is supposed to look on the inside and instead I was like man this is not not it we're on a tangent what were originally were you going to say do you even remember oh I'm writing this essay called who's your Elon and I I wrote this because I have this philosophy that you are what you admire so pick and choose what you admire because you will your body will start to gravitate towards that and I think as Founders the default the factory setting that you get wired with when you decide I'm going to be a Founder is cool then you should want to be Elon Musk or Steve Jobs right those are the that's the North Star would you agree for most people like it just the default factory setting for for entrepreneurs yeah and before Elon it was Zuck and before Zuck was Steve Jobs and before Steve Jobs or Bill Gates or whatever like that's kind of like the the the transition here and so Elon today he's the goat and it makes sense he's built badass companies that change the world Tesla SpaceX PayPal open AI even actually he helped create start uh he's the richest entrepreneur in the world he's the most famous entrepreneur of the world he seems like a badass because he goes after these hard problems in these big markets uh and he's just doing cool [ __ ] electric cars launching rockets that will land themselves on on a tiny boat in the middle of the ocean like he's incredible Ving dozens of women to have his children and then convincing the rest of the public that it was cool that he was just doing his part to save civilization instead of like just impregnating everybody around them um so so he's incredible but also I don't want to be him right because like his family life is a mess he seems super stressed like his schedule is not the schedule I would want like if you want those trade-offs great more power to you it's not the trade-offs I would choose and so I think it is you see when he tweeted out where Zuck was uh doing like the surfing thing on Fourth of July and Eli was like that's cute I'm busy working yeah I pref that's he can have his parties on his Yachts I prefer to work oh my God that was the lamest [ __ ] I ever heard also somebody replied with a great tweet great thing they they posted the analytics of how much how many tweets and likes he had done that month and it's like I prefer to work and he's like tweeted and likes like a thousand times that month it's like bro you're not working yeah um anyways I I think that uh Elon is great in many ways if he's your if he's your North Star more power to you uh but if he's not it's important to pick who is your North Star and I guess uh you were talking about this woman an and how we kind of admire that she was able to just like fearlessly go in and learn new things have the confidence learn just enough to be dangerous but also move on and like have multiple chapters in her life I realized that that was that was my answer is somebody who's more of a polymath somebody who has they walked into Disneyland and they said I want to ride all rides they don't spend all their time just like perfecting one ride they were like I only have a certain amount of time on this Earth I want to I want to go ride all the rides who are examples for you so like the historical example is like Ben Franklin so Ben Franklin like you know has his he had his scientist era he invent like he invented the bifocals the Franklin stove and then he created the best newsletter of its time right he invented a newspaper the the Pennsylvanian Gazette and then he was a founding father and he was in politics and he helped write the Constitution and then so convinced many women to have his babies of course that's a prerequisite um he then was the CEO of the US postal system for a period of time and then in music he invented like a musical instrument he he had like he he influenced many people Mozart Beethoven said that Ben Franklin influenced them what a guy right like what a what a [ __ ] Legend and so I hear that and I'm like dude that sounds that sounds epic like if I could think of what what is the top of the top like that's really cool and there's okay modern day examples we had Jesse itler on the podcast and when Jesse's episode you can go watch it it's uh I don't know what episode number but go just go on YouTube and WR Jesse Isler my first million this is a guy who was like I'm gonna be a rapper he's a white Jewish rapper and then he becomes a corporate jingle writer then he's an entrepreneur creates a coconut water brand and a private jet brand then he's like [ __ ] it I'm going to get really into health and fitness and running and he becomes an endurance athlete he lives in a monastery with monks he has David gogins come live in his house he wrote books he married Sarah Blakeley he's got four or five kids seems like a good dad when I called him to prep for the Pod he was like ra you know wrangling that hurting sheep trying to get to the soccer game or soccer practice that day and uh you know I just find that really interesting people have had these multiple different arcs and careers in different zones and genres um there's a guy Neil centurio who I really admire he's in San Diego how do you spell his name uh Neil and then centurio senen Tu r i a he's got a great book that it's not popular but I met him and he gave me a copy of his book it's called I'm there for you baby and um you know Neil stories like he was a Hollywood script writer then to try to make a buck he's like dude San Diego's booming and he got into the real estate development game and built helped like kind of fund and build a skyscraper in downtown San Diego and then he met a kid in an elevator who had a good startup idea and he invested in it and became CH and then he started a dozen companies and some of them worked some of them didn't some are in biotech some are in consumer like he started a whole bunch of different things and into art he's you know he's got multiple chapters and when I met him we went to his house he's like oh yeah I'm writing this book now about this woman who created the biggest Ponzi scheme and I think this should become a movie and he was like this guy's in his like 70s and he's he's still going he's still got ideas and energy energy and his zest for life and he's like doesn't count himself out of any Pursuit and I think I like that I I think I like people who don't count themselves out who don't feel like I can't do it because I haven't done it and that limiting belief is just one I don't want in my life if you Google this guy there's not a lot of news or information out of him but there is a San Diego uh Tribune article and its title is why having fun is good for the soul yeah it's about him I'm down with that I'm down with that I'm very down with that are you have you seen the uh Ben Franklin TV show on Apple you know I watched the trailer of it and then I just didn't feel hooked is it good I should I watch it if you're a history nerd it's awesome and okay but he just [ __ ] partied he was like like they were trying to convince the French chill like join the American Revolution and do you know that scene in the office where Michael Scott and Jan go to this dinner at like an apple Tuesday con to convince that man to do their business and Jan wants to get down to business and Michael like Mich talks for like two hours right yeah he's like hey you guys want to get some baby back ribs and he starts singing the baby back ribs song and they all get drunk and he's partying and then at the end he does the deal and Michael's like I [ __ ] told you Jan this is how it works right that's what Ben Franklin did he basically went over there with James Madison and James is all buttoned up and they're like let's do our thing and he's like no dude we're gonna party let's go to the parties and they get wasted and like there's scenes where like him and other diplomats are like pissing together on a uh when they're like drunk at a party and like while they're peeing he's like hey so the American Revolution you know we could use your help like it's things like that like you see that he was like a pretty smooth dude and it's pretty awesome um it's a great show um and Al I thought his biography by Walter isacson I thought it [ __ ] sucked I'm one of the few people that thought was suck his suck but his autobiography is pretty good but yeah Ben Franklin's all right he's the man um okay what else we got uh I'll do one more quick thing this is just a quick funny thing ah I don't even want to say it's funny interesting so Rejuvenation Olympics do remember when we talked about that is that the uh steroids allowed Olympics is that what that no that's the enhanced games which is also got mix up which is this is the reverse this is the reverse aging Brian Johnson thing yeah so the leader board we originally found Brian that I take pride in that I've said that many times we kind of got we were on a couple people early Brian's one of them dude you keep saying it and it actually destroys the value that we had in finding him early because it's kind of like Jason calanis the third investor in Uber it's like it would have been cool if you're like you know Jason was if somebody else says you know Jason was actually the third investor in Uber but when Jason says you know I was the third investor in Uber a thousand times it's like dude we get it it's to you're now you're overcompensating I think that's what's happening here with uh we discovered Brian Johnson look don't have that many discoveries so I feel good about this particular one uh but Brian Johnson we talked about him a bunch of times we had him on the podcast you went to his house uh really interesting guy originally when we talked to him we brought up the Rejuvenation Olympics and we talked about it and this website was super janky but now if you go to it's much better it still honestly sucks I just dm' them and I'm like dude your website like I don't know how to use it but it's a lot better than before Rejuvenation Olympics is this leaderboard where uh before or he didn't have a partnership but he would say like go and buy this like $800 blood work and upload your results here and do it if you do it three times we take the average and we're going to create this thing called the Rejuvenation Olympics where they use this one blood work to decide how slow you are aging and so the people who are aging the slowest based off this TR I think it's true Diagnostics uh based off of their test uh they have this thing called like a dune Pace score and it like measures let's just explain the simple thing Norm you would expect in one year of chronological time you would Age one year of biological time so the idea with the Rejuvenation Olympics is in one year of chronological time so one calendar year do you can you age less than one year can your body age less than one year of kind of like cell damage basically yeah and the top guy here his average pace is 0.56 so every year he's only aging half a year yeah and and so it's like an interesting thing and it's actually a super interesting business for a few a few reasons one he actually has a partnership with true Diagnostics but in order to do the to be verified on Rejuvenation olympics.com you have to take the average of three tests each test is very expensive and then in order to stay on the leaderboard you have to like continue doing averages so you have to like do this freaking test every quarter so actually the expenses uh add up but well true Diagnostics $500 living forever Priceless well it's has a price if you look at some of these guys because if you look at like the you what I I got curious and I went through the list of the people who are top on the Rejuvenation Olympics and most of them are like like you'll see like what's that dude's name Peter diamandis or whatever you remember like some rich guy Brian Johnson is near the top rich guy it's all like these like healthy people or like healthy rich people or who are spending a lot of money or it's like a biohacker so like someone whose like job is to do this stuff and they like blog about it and they make money do it I'm just going to say this right now Brian I love you but I will not use this website until you link their names to an Instagram this website is useless to me unless Craig McCall I need to be able to click and go see who this guy is I can't use the sign until that happens that is the only feature I need we are on the same page my friend because if you look at the Instagram of the link so there's a woman named Julia Gibson Clark so roughly 8,000 people have like done this test and uh and she at the time when I was doing research if you go to view all rankings let's see is she still up top she's like in the top eight yeah okay was number two I did research on this woman she's just a lady she's just a lady who's like fit and someone else picked up on this and they're like who's this Julie Gibson Clark woman and they did this article about her she's like I make 100 Grand a year like I exercise five days a week but like and I just eat vegetables but like I'll just go for a walk sometimes or a rug like I just live like a decently healthy lifestyle and she's like number six or number seven on this list and I thought it was awesome that this 57y old woman who's not a very wealthy person who isn't like a professional at doing all this [ __ ] she's just living like a pretty well balanced it seems life she's number seven and she's kicking ass and if you click on some of the photos very attractive woman like she looks like a very healthy woman doesn't look like she's got any like plastic surgery she makes 100 Grand a year she uh eats uh vegetables for snacks so like instead of eating like potato chips she'll just eat carrots sticks and she takes just a couple vitamins in the morning and that's basically it and she actually she lifts weights twice a weeks twice a week and she goes for runs twice a week and then the other day she's just walking a lot right and she's killing it by the way I have to apologize to everybody I did an interview with Brian Johnson probably like a year ago now I don't know how long it's been it's been like six months it's been like a year I went to his house I did a three-hour interview with him we had professional cameraman it was great and I was so excited about it we came back I started editing all I did a bunch of interviews in LA and I started editing one by one and I you know I edited five of them we released them and the Brian Johnson one was kind of like my finale and I was so excited about it but I was also like it's a kind of like higher stakes and um higher Stakes almost because I thought it could be great but it would require more time and patience in the edit partly because of the way we filmed it with multiple cameras and whatnot and I put it off I got busy and I started doing other things and then I just didn't do it and I didn't release the episode and so this earlier this week I asked Diego I said Diego um it is now out of my hands I said I'm giving you this episode you are going to edit this and we're going to release this even though it's been a year um better late than never and I said do matter if it's a year away I have been the Blocker of this because I initially I was a perfectionist about it which is weird because I'm never a perfectionist I just really wanted it to be good and then later I was like well now it's been seven months this some of the stun things he's talking about don't even make sense anymore uh but but whatever I'm gonna I told him I said you don't have to ask me about it just edit it and make it good and then we're going to release it so I will I will write my wrong and uh better late than never here dude no one would like no one cares or would know that it's a year old right well there's some things he says maybe he's like oh we're gonna launch this and it's like it's actually been launched now or whatever like you know a year later uh you know he's reversed aged he looks younger now so you know it might throw people off ah would you want to look like him um would I want to look like him yeah just shredded like when you say like exactly like him like I don't look like me anymore or just like my body your body oh hell yeah dude all he needs is a tan he looks so shredded that he's got an insane body he just needs a tan but actually it's smart that he doesn't do the 10 cuz like what I've realized is that Brian Johnson is a marketing IUS and um no [ __ ] whoever he's hired to run his Twitter account which I don't think it's him cuz his personality is he's a really nice guy but he's not like super he's not like super memey but his Twitter game is now like really good and smart and like memes well I think he hired a meme dealer and he's got somebody doing his Twitter uh because it's very smart what he's doing um no he seems like a guy who could like study it and like Implement and by the way I'll put one thing in the ground I might be fooled by this who knows but uh there's a lot of people who are like oh he's just doing this to make money no no no he made a lot of money he I believe he did this because it gave his life purpose after he had already made a bunch of money agree and it gave him a purpose a higher Mission a more ambitious thing to do and he got really into it um and I think he's 100% genuine and even if he releases products that are associated with it I think it's only to help this cause like and I'm normally very skeptical like when most people do things and they say they're Mission driven I'm like oh is Mission code for money driven like what what are you talking about here um in this case I actually think Briant Johnson is one of the few truly Mission driven people in this and I think a lot of people the more popular he gets more people will want to tear him down um and I'm just going to put out my position which is um I believe that he is super genuine about everything that he's doing I meaning I I believe he's genuine in his intent and I believe his um he is actually Mission driven when he's doing this that's does anyone doubt that oh there's a lot of people who are like you know like you he named his olive oil like snake oil because so many people were like calling him a snake oil salesman because they're like oh you're just trying to sell us supplements and pills and um and blah blah blah you know the one thing I think that might happen is I don't think he I think he might be more experimental in everything that he's doing and not publish everything um I don't have any reason to say that I just I wouldn't be surprised if that was true because I think he's truly G to be on The Cutting Edge and also there's some responsibility in what you put out there to others and maybe he waits until something is proven to be effective or safe before he tells people he's been experimenting with it I think that might be true I just think that you have to be really rich to tweet out how many boners you're getting in the middle of the night and like he does this whole experiment where he's trying to uh improve how much erections he gets in the middle of the night only wearable worth wearing have you seen the wearable it's like a ring it's like a little like Fitbit that's how they measure cuz that was my question when he started putting the data I was like is there someone watching how do you know how are you measuring this and then he showed the device it's like a little rubber band around a stack of Dimes exactly like uh that's cool but why is it so big I don't think I'm gonna need all that is there one that a baby car yeah is this is this a bracelet to put this how does it work when you measured on my wrist yeah exactly well if you made it this far you got one of our uh rare dick jokes um all right is that it that's the pod that's it all right all right [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I was sitting in a meeting and there was somebody who was prolific like if Kendrick Lamar wore a suit and sold B2B software that was this guy this guy had lyrics he was lyrical with his corporate slang and it got me thinking about epic corporate slang and some of my favorite greatest hits of corpor slang and I just started thinking you know we need some more and so I wanted to play a little game with you so I'd like to play a game I texted you this I said I want you to think of this think of corporate slang that doesn't exist but it should because we're innovators here on the podcast and I want to come up with some slang I think it would be a fun claim to fame if we could just make something stick uh with corporate slang so I say we go back and forth like a rap battle with this is Corporate slang that doesn't exist but it should all right you have more than me I didn't I I came with about four or five you you have a bunch of them this is right near wheelhouse so let's see what we can do though all right so the first one is going to be this the first one one man's Thanksgiving is another man's Thursday and this is for any situation where you are uh when somebody's really excited about something that you to you is just normal or even lame but hey it's their Thanksgiving it might just be Thursday to you but it's their Thanksgiving so it's kind of a way to throw shade in a corporate setting when somebody's overly excited about something that's actually just normal or average and you just say hey man one man Thanksgiving is another man's Thursday and you just plant that seed and you just leave it with them and they'll realize later that they just they just had shade thrown at them and that's a phrase that you need to use and when someone is like wait what and you're like wait you don't know what that means yeah like it's just one of those things they say yeah like when I was a kid I thought it was uh go out there and break an egg not go out there and break a leg you know what I mean so we'll make that a phrase or uh instead of catlike reflexes I thought it was Cadillac reflexes uh this not even corporate like these are just um like stutters that you had yeah yeah so I used to say for years like you know go out there have fun break an egg uh so we that's how you need to use this phrase um all right I got one all right we're g to call it bubble wrap as in when someone like do you have any employees that are overly sensitive and when you bring news to them you have to be like how are we going to phrase this so like we got to bubble wrap this yeah like all right we have to we have to tell this guy about this thing but we got to bubble wrap his ass and we got to Bubble Wrap This phrasing and we got to figure out how we can deliver this so it doesn't like totally crush him instead of just saying uh hey we're not doing that anymore your idea sucked we gotta bubble wrap it so we gotta bubble wrap it okay so it's actually like a a it's like I like what you're saying you're right but we're gonna need to bubble wrap that before it goes out yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so you have to say in a more sensitive way not to uh freak uh particular person out because that person when you talk to him you got to bubble wrap him before you talk to him so we're g call Bubble Wrap like I like that that's that's strong all right I got another one alohamora so making email intros sucks I hate doing it it's like oh can you introduce to this person I gotta say hey Bob meet me Sean he's he's this guy he's this guy I'm I'm sh to one word we're using the Harry Potter word Ura for the spell that just is like unlocking doors so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to go to an email thread I'm just going to say sam Bob aor voice H Hora fellas I've unlocked the doors here go on through and that's it I'm shortening it to one thing what uh but what's that word from Harry Potter it's a it's the spell he uses to unlock any door oh my God all right that one's extra nerdy um all right I've got another one all right so you know how in the Google Calendar the default is typically 30 minutes MH I hate that so we're going to call this we're going to say um so we're going to use this word when it's like hey put something on my calendar and let's syn storm it we're just going to syn storm it so it's a by default it's a five minute meeting so let's just syntor uh you know and people say like let's let's sync up and it's always either default 30 or 60 Minutes no [ __ ] that we're gonna syn storm this we're gonna get done in just about four or five minutes so hey just put something on my calendar put a little sink storm on my calendar and we're gonna bang this out I love it because the other person's going to have no idea what you mean by that but it sounds like they're supposed to know it's yeah no problem love love s storman it's my one of my favorite things to do and they're going to walk away be like what the hell am I supposed to do here we got a s storm this summer [ __ ] don't it's also nice because it's a way they're like it's it's the equivalent of dating at first date and being like they're like hey let's grab dinner and you're like let's do drinks yeah yeah yeah it's actually that yeah you got a sing stor it um all right what do you have all right we got to crash the boards here so this is a sports one that's that's going to be used in the corporate settings so it's when you're emailing people but you're not following up hard enough so you're you're you're emailing a prospect you're trying to do a sale and you notice there's just no follow-up there's no follow-up email so either you could just use it like you know when you're following up you could be like hey I'm just crashing the boards here or you could tell your sales team be like hey we really got to crash the boards here fellas and they know oh that means we got to really just follow up strong I used to use the word Blitz grig when referring to that and then I realized that referencing uh World War I World War II Germany and their military tactics probably wasn't the the the best thing uh so you're a little too blond hair blueeyed to be using that one yeah yeah yeah we had a bubble we have to bubble bubble wrap Blitz and use crashing the boards that's pretty good you got another um yeah so uh let's do um all right so you know how when you have a meeting and oftentimes even if it's a good idea you still it turns into a vote a lot of times uh where it's like look not everyone thinks that's a good idea so we're not going to go with it even though a lot of times the non-popular choice is the good one and so what you do is you try to like be political and get people on your side before the meeting uh and so like they vote for your idea or whatever we're going to call that landsliding um look we're gonna have a meeting but we gotta Landslide this in advance and we got to get everyone to vote for our side and we gotta Landslide this meeting this idea needs to get Landslide so we're gonna call it Landslide that's powerful I like that all right this is when you got an employee who it's sink or swim you got somebody new and you need to really figure out what they're made of it's are we boiling eggs or potatoes here and it's a way to ask about somebody what they're really made of cuz when you like a potato starts out really hard but if you boil it it gets soft but an egg starts out soft but if you apply some heat it gets hard and you want you want eggs you don't want potatoes in your company and so that's that's where you put that out there and it's when times are getting tough and people are are wilting they're they're folding under the pressure under the heat you just got to ask are we boiling eggs or potatoes here that's a good one I think that's an old phrase from the south haven't I heard like grandpa say that have you ever heard that I have not but maybe I got I've been told I have an old soul so maybe that's that's that's a good one um all right this is the last one that I have um we're gonna call all right so you know you were just in a meeting where uh a guy was saying a lot of jargon or oftentimes you'll be in a meeting and like people are lying they'll be like well we're doing great uh it's like well we're not really doing that great and so for that we're going to use the phrase [ __ ] Bingo it's like hey are we having a meeting about what we're going to do or are we just playing [ __ ] Bingo and winning right now uh this is this meeting is just a game of [ __ ] Bingo and we're killing it and so yeah it's like Sean look you're telling me all this nonsense nonsense I think your board is full uh for [ __ ] Bingo uh this is just nonsense and so we're call it [ __ ] bingo I like that one it's a way to call someone out but because it's an alliteration it just saw it just bubble wrapped it just enough Bubble WP is the real winner here it sounds like all right I got one last one this is similar to um situation where somebody's we're trying really hard but we're working on the wrong things feels like we're just massaging elbows here it's when you're working on a problem and you're working really hard but that you're working on something that doesn't really matter there's not enough meat on the bone there and so you're just massaging elbows it's the wrong place to be applying the effort I like that one I like that one but you have one more that I think you should you should finalize with the one about a tree yeah so this one came from Diego uh because I was brain soring with him and he goes it's when you have an employee uh okay so the phrase is I think we're trying to teach a fish how to climb a tree and it's when you have an employee and you're putting them in a position that's not really their core strength they're great as a fish but they need to be in water and you put them in a position maybe it's a a technical person you got them on sales calls and it's we're trying to put a we're trying to teach a fish how to climb a tree here and you'd just be better off putting them in their natural environment and letting them succeed there than really just working against you know the laws of nature have you used any of these phrases yet I I'm going to start this this was this was a brain this was a sink storm and so now I'm ready to start all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

all right I've got a thing I want to fill you in on and this is something I've been thinking about lately and I think that you actually you're going to bring more application to this topic than I am and so it's my theory but I want to hear how you would apply this idea that I have all right hit me so did you see that blondhair woman she had that song that was like looking for a man in finance 64 whatever yeah what was it what was it blasphemy 65 bro 65 is finance trust F 65 eyes or whatever dude have I seen that has there been 10 minutes in my house where either me or my daughter is not singing that song my four-year-old daughter by the way hits very different when your daughter says it my dad hormones kicked in and I was like you ain't looking for what are you looking for you're looking for your Barbie your toys get you're looking for Legos this what you're looking [Music] for there was really funny follow-ups where people are like let's do the math on that by the way how many men are are 65 it's like 0.1% how many people live in New York City how many have have a trust fund and it was like you know and they're single it was like there was like seven guys left yeah yeah it's pretty funny but that got me thinking and before I tell you exactly what it is I have to ask you a question do you know your Mother's or Father's cell phone number by heart I do not so for the life of me I couldn't tell you my wife's phone number I could tell you the the area code but I couldn't tell you her number which is like a big deal however how many commercials from the 90s do you remember I want my baby back baby back baby back I want my baby back there yeah or a Hot Pocket like you remember some of these songs five $ five we know we know what comes up to after that I don't even have to have known you right you could be a complete stranger but if I'm like five five the guy's gonna stay foot long at the end of that so I got really interested in Jingles because I don't remember my wife's phone number you don't remember your parents' phone numbers but I can recite all these jingles in fact I follow Instagram accounts where it's like commercials from the 90s the '90s at because that's when we were kids for and for a lot of listeners that was the Heyday of these jingles and commercials and in my opinion we need to bring that back and I want to tell you I'll give you a little little bit a short history of of Jingles so in the 90s something like 15% of commercials had Jingles now it's closer to 1% so in the 20s this company called General Mills came out with this thing called weedies wedi cereal and it wasn't that big of a hit early on and so they were like let's write a song about it and we're going to create a commercial on the radio for weedies and it's the first time that there was ever a dedicated commercial for a product and the weedies wasn't really doing that well for the first three or four years that song comes out in year five or so it takes off and now weedies is like a huge brand that we all know and I just I I think that we need to do more of that in the '90s it kind of kicked out because when we were kids there was what like 50 or 60 channels so there was less channels and the key to a jingle sticking and like a something remember is you need to hear it tons and tons of times so when the wed commercial came out they ended up playing this uh song something like 300 times a day on a variety of radio stations and and back then there weren't actually that many radio stations and so repetition is important however once YouTube Facebook whatever it came about we have so many different channels however when you run Facebook ads you can increase the repetition the frequency I think they call it right you can increase frequency and so you can see like am I hitting the same person 20 30 50 times a lot of times with ads it's just a photo right it's usually a photo for like there's little silly trends like for a long time it was pointing an arrow at something or zoom in on someone's face there's like little silly trends that you'll see one successful brand do everyone copies them yeah one we had was we would write the ad in the notes app on iPhone take a screenshot of that so it looked like someone was sharing a screenshot from notes but it was actually just an ad yes and I remember reading or seeing this short video it was launched at Sundance actually it was like a featurette in 2016 maybe You' saw this but it was about people who have Alzheimer's and they were like really bad you know their elderly have Alzheimer's and they they were just out of it all the time and so these these doctors played music that the the people would have listened to when they were in their 20s and 30s and all of a sudden it clicks and they start singing the song and they're like oh I remember this song I was in the Army doing this or whatever and that's when I met my wife and and then they like have the next three four five minutes they're like speaking normal and it kind of like made me realize music is really important for that reason but particularly for advertising Brands and products and I've been trying to think about what does a jingle have that makes it work and so I have it down to a few things and this is a little bit for the modern day Le what it needs the first thing that I think it needs is it needs a little bit of cringiness I think with ads we be like this needs to be cool like it needs to be a little bit overly cringed that's the second thing that you have to have is it has to be incredibly repetitive for example do you remember that song Don't You Wanna Fanta Fanta Don't You Wanna like you need to say the brand many many many times like Chita banana yeah so the Chita banana ad is actually interesting so that ad it was like a sexy banana dressed up as like a Cuban lady dancer and she was like singing and dancing and it was all and it was all about when do you know a banana is ready to eat and so she was singing about like you can you should peel me back when you see a little bit of brown like whatever it was kind of like sexualized and awesome and that ad would play hundreds of times a day it was awesome I love what people sexualize stuff by the way my friend Neville had a had an ad for why you should buy this set of font from him and he was like when I whisper Janda does it make you weak in the knees if so this is for you and so I love when they do that and the last thing you need is a call to action so do you remember this song where it's like call JG wwor 877 cash now do you remember that song yeah you can remember full phone numbers when it comes to a jingle right was you can't you started this by saying can't remember your your wife or your mom's number but we can remember some Company's phone number 1800 whatever if they put it in a jingle and so this whole kind of rant is I think we need to bring them back now the problem is is that I don't exactly have like a consumer brand to do this on you do and you work a little bit more consumer stuff why can't you do this for Hampton by the way I could and I should so that was a [ __ ] excuse yeah thank you do you see this working with your stuff in consumer well I would say in theory I'm all there with you as in Jingles work is a is a non-debatable statement would Jingles work for my brand well why not Jingles work so we're back to swear one do Jingles still work yeah I'm pretty sure it's still works I think you might have to tweak the form factor maybe make it a little shorter or whatever you know like uh McDonald's like what they do now is they have their whole commercial and then it's I'm loving it right just they just hit that at the end as like a little 5-second hook at the end which was shorter than maybe how how Jingles used to be where it was much more of the whole commercial so I think there's maybe some tweaks that people are doing to them but they they for sure still work so I'm with you and I'm also with you that I'm surprised that they've declined because the brain has not changed in fact there's a thing I think people called the phonic Loop or something like the phonetic loop I forgot how they call it but it's like the the people who study the brain and the ear and there's like neurologists there's even somebody called like a musicologist they basically try to figure out why is it that when we teach kids that they learn easier through nursery rhymes yeah there's like a nursery rhyme to like learn your your home address like have you ever seen those dude I could tell you karacas Venezuela Lima Peru right I can tell you like the capitals of South America that I haven't thought about in 30 years but when I was 6 years old some teacher taught us the song right or all of the states right they I could teach my daughter of the states much faster than I could teach her numbers because I could turn it into a song and so there's something in this right and I think they call it earworms it's basically the what they call it when the a small repetitive snippet of a song or a slogan or a jingle just gets stuck in your ear right and and it that's called an earworm and so using this to improve recall improve memory and even make your brand associated with something that's kind of fun or upbeat or positive definitely has value now the question is why why don't I or you or any of us kind of modern marketers use this and I think really most people would say well it doesn't work anymore the form form factor changed people got over it blah I don't think any of that's true I think it's just like fashion I think it's marketing fashion trends I think it's out of out of Vogue right now and as soon as somebody brings it back in it will become a thing again remember that piff that was where like mixtapes were it was like rappers so this was I it was like little Wayne would put out like a rap a day on that pip and he would just turn these suckers out I think you need a certain creative type of person to be able to do this but we can definitely churn these out in a relatively fast way and see what works which is different than a commercial but one of the reasons why I think it went away is so the things that you and I liked when we were 9 or eight years old by the time we're 15 25 that's like that's lame that's no longer cool but then we get in our 30s and we're like oh I remember that that was awesome you know that was so cool like it's kind of like the feeling that you get when you see a surge like a surge drink like a soda you're like oh I remember that that was so awesome I remember I was a kid and you get like this Nostalgia and so I think what we can do is look at all of the past things that worked well with the brands that we liked when we were younger I really think you can replicate them within like the the law and actually not copy and the reason I think that is because the $5 foot long song and McDonald's songs they're coming back and so they're reusing a lot of these songs now because once your customer base is a bit older you can reuse the same stuff and it becomes cool again because it's nostalgic I'm subscribed to my million on YouTube there we go well we could Workshop that if you want the to be memorable which we all do then using one of the most sticky things which is like a a jingle it's com it compresses several things together right A Feeling a position positioning right $5 foot long Nationwide is on your side right like compresses a position plus a feeling into four seconds 5 Seconds 7 seconds and in a package that is now easily transmissible right you can sing it you can hum it you can tell it to another person as well as um sticks with you so like of course that's a that's a good thing if you can do it all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show I got something that's kind of interesting totally different angle but I think you'll like it are you familiar with poly Market is it is it gambling for crypto well that's one way of looking at it it's a prediction Market which is yeah yeah sort of an AOL lean situation with gambling and you know reframing gambling but it actually is a way to go bet on a prediction that you believe will happen so if I go to poly market right now I will see the top bet two $237 million has been bet on who will be the winner of the 2024 presidential race and right now Trump is a 61% Joe Biden 19% you know odds comma is 10% Etc and so you could see for any idea you have there could be a betting market for it so like you know you can go to sports and right now the I think the Euro soccer cup is happening right now and Spain is the top top favorite bet with 34% or you can bet on Wimbledon right now but you can also bet in like scientific things like there's a BET right now what will be the June 2024 temperature increase and it's like you know more than 1.09 less than 1.09 you know you could bet on will this hurricane hit the United States yes or no and right now that bet has played out where like you could see that when it started it only had a 18% chance of yes night right now it's a 99% chance which means it's about to hit or almost certainly hit so that bet is played out or playing out right now and you could see the top betters so there's a guy named revenge tour 1984 who's bet $2.3 million this week his if you go to his profile so he's the top better on the platform right now so he's got 1.69 million 1.66 million uh in bets placed basically his positions that are out there he's got a p&l where where his profit and loss is he's up about a million dollar so far on poly market and he's traded $169 Million worth of of bets so like right now for example he's got a bet out will JD Vance win the 2024 Republican VP nomination he bet it when it was at 6 cents it's currently at 31 cents he could just sell that position today and Bank The Profit even though it hasn't happened yet so you can win even if your thing doesn't win as long as the odds go up so a couple of years ago I got on poly market and I got really addicted to this thing every day I was going and I basically had like a $10,000 slush fund that I was just betting on poly Mark and I think I ended up five or six grand and then I cashed out because now you can't do it in the United States they like ruled against it basically so all of this volume this they're doing about 50 million a month in volume which is huge probably the most popular crypto app right now is poly market and so they've done 400 million this year in betting volume so they're on Pace for almost a billion dollars of betting volume this year what did you bet on I used to bet on all kinds of things so I would bet on like Tech stuff so you could bet like will Tesla stock be above this price in J on July 31st it's like easier than buying the stock was just to go and bet do you think it'll be here or will they announce this at this time I was betting on sports stuff so I would bet just like a game there's a game on a Tuesday night and I could just bet here easier than I could bet uh you know at a Sportsbook because the way this thing worked was you would just sign in with your metamask wallet you didn't have to do kyc you didn't have to do a bunch of things who makes the odds there's no there's no odds maker so this is like a what's called a um automated Market maker so basically the the bet gets created and then it's based on the betting volume so if more people start betting no then the odds of no go down because that's a more popular bet if everybody thinks yes then buying yes will have less upside for you most of these don't work like an order book there's not a buyer and seller it's a it's the same way that a lot of the the dexes work or the nft platforms work where it's it's a amm a lot of the bets are weird so will Taylor Swift be pregnant in 2024 yeah 30 30% chance right or something like that 21% chance will Andrew Tate be found guilty of human trafficking in 2024 but then there's weird things like Will trump say the word MOG in 2024 I don't know what that word isog but can't he just say that then and win the bet and so that's one of the controversies of betting markets is that uh okay the easy example is oh wow if I'm Trump I could theoretically go place a big bet and then just say the word but there's a couple problems with that one the more I like let's say something like that it probably has very thin volume so for example right now $24,000 yeah $24,000 so if he went and tried to bet $100,000 he would swing the odds himself to yes to the point where it wouldn't really be worth it there's not much action on the other side so basically the yeses when the money from the nose and the nose when the money from the yeses depending on how the BET plays out right there's no there's no third party that's involved so you would have to do it in one of these that has like really big volume if wanted to make a lot of money it says uh will Travis Kelce go for ring number four and get engaged this year yeah exactly uh there's you know Elon tweets how many tweets will we have this month there's uh Will T will Tik Tok get banned in the US in 2024 right now only eight% chance so if you thought that Tik Tok was GNA get banned if you're Pelosi you could go and start betting yes but that bet only has 29,000 of volume so you can't bet too much you can't make too much of a profit on something like that the controversy the thing that people have always said about prediction markets is that prediction markets become assassination markets meaning if there was a bet that like will this person win or will this person live and let's say there was hundreds of millions of dollars on the line you've inadvertently created a giant bounty to go and assassinate somebody and this is the one of the one of the controversies around prediction markets is that it could become um you know problematic in that way but these are not new like crypto is a new way of doing it but these have been around for a long time like historically people felt that prediction markets were more accurate than uh polls right so let's say you wanted to say you know who's going to win the election they would go to a poll you have a very small sample size people might say one thing then do another which is like what happened with uh when Trump won I think 2016 was he was um polling far less than than what actually happened when people went to the ballot Bo because they didn't want to admit where where they stood whereas prediction markets because you're putting money on the line it's just more predictive it's more accurate vers versus just general polling and so this used to be a really popular thing there was in fact even like on the stock market you could go and bet this way Wall Street was like a hub for uh for prediction bets but then after World War II there was kind of a social stigma around it newspaper stopped quoting it and they they shifted to polls but I think that I think it's swinging back where we're going to go away from polls and back to prediction markets and so my prediction this whole thing is that poly Market is going to be massive that um in this presidential election it's going to have just like a huge runup this year because already you can see that when every When anybody is writing about the odds of something about let's say the election they're referencing poly market and they're embedding poly Market in their articles they're doing that now or you think they it's already happening it's already happening it's why it's got this huge surge I think a couple months ago they had over 100 million embedding volume and it was because it's made for TV It's Made to be embedded in articles and in fact I think they should take this further and make their little their little betting widget much easier to share and much easier to embed inside of Articles inside of news news things because they're going to need to quote what the predictions are around interest rates around presidential uh stuff it's just going to continue to grow that way and so I think poly Market is actually sort of a media company a decentralized media company where it has really interesting data that every other media company is going to want to reference and that's going to just drive this Surge and they've also had just really viral bets so right now one of the the viral bets is obviously the presidential election stuff but when remember when the idiots went down to the Titanic and the submersible that was one of the most viral bets I think they had like $60 million bet on that one thing of like what's going to happen with the submersible so you know they they can go viral like just yesterday it had 5 million in volume and so businesses booming for poly Market who started it and when did it start this guy Shane uh Shane coplan I think is his name and he started in 2020 so this is not a very old business this you know pretty pretty recent three four years it's been out and um he I think it's like his first thing he his LinkedIn when I was on it earlier was like he was an intern at Rap Genius he was an intern at some other place and then he created poly market and he's been doing that for four years now did they raise money yeah they just raised a big round so it was pretty it was pretty under the radar and actually sort of um you know seemed sort of sketchy before like when I was betting on it people I remember tell like were telling me like what are you doing dude you you put real money onto this thing and I was like yeah it's awesome and they're like who runs this is this legal I was like I don't really know you know I'm not sure it just it looked like a very thin thin app at the time but they just raised $75 million from Founders fund and Joe gbia and vitalic and a whole bunch of other Heavy Hitters and so it's obviously become a lot more legitimized I hate talking about gambling because I'm like I don't want to sound like my farts don't smell type of guy or what like I'm better but I am because I hate gambling like I don't I don't like gambling and I don't particularly love products that make it more popular which is weird because I have vices like I love nicotine and [ __ ] like that so I would be bummed if no one made that stuff but I feel weird making this more popular you know what I mean I understand I don't know obviously I enjoy Bing I've bet on many things I have a bit of a bing problem I would say the well it's like porn we consume it but we're like you know that's disgusting that you would do this for a living that's disgusting zip yeah like all right so but but I I I think there is actually a lot of value in this so I think that the wisdom of the crowds has always been a phenomenon I've been interested in and I think it's just a more pure form of information like I think that it is very easy for the news to tell you one thing or random polls to be quoted and claimed like I like things that are more ground truth and I I don't know like more ground truth is a actual betting Market on something that is what people actually believe and the wisdom of the crowd it is very hard to beat the the wisdom of the crowds when it comes to betting I don't I don't know if I buy that yet mostly because I'm ignorant to these predictive markets in 2016 what did whatever existed before poly Market what did it say about the election um it wasn't as popular back then so they there's been like augur and a couple other crypto prediction markets but they were never mature enough they didn't have enough volume or the people that consumed were only crypto degenerates and so only crypto degenerates skewed one way it's almost more like a poll in that case so I'm not sure what they said then all I know is that all of the polls were wrong 538 was wrong all of the sort of like data science around polling was so wrong during that and I know that also that the other unrelated data point is that one of the things that helped FTX take off back then was Sam bankman freed was one of the first to put political bets on his platform I think in 2020 and it was a big accelerant for FTX was um letting people bet on Election election information back then and people around the world wanted to bet and so it was a way to attract a lot of liquidity to FTX at the time what was his like philosophy SP SPS philosophy it was like what was it called altruism yeah effective altruism but doesn't him having betting on his website go against that no not at all effective altruism doesn't mean no no sin no Vice effective altruism basically means make as much money as you can the highest impact way to give and contribute to the world is to first like do something that's going to accumulate a huge amount of capital so you can reallocate it to getting them adct like addicted to things that they spend all their money been freed right you're more you are more value like you you have two choices you could go work for a nonprofit or go volunteer in a soup kitchen and pour pour soup every day day but that's a pretty low leverage way to give to contribute versus if you become a billionaire and you give give away a billion dollars you have done more good that way and so effective altruism is basically working for the purpose of accumulating as much Capital to give away as possible now in his case he turned out to be you know a liar and a fraud on many accounts right so it's not I think he sort of Tanked the brand of effective altruism which probably is a little unfair he also tanked the brand of crypto which is a little unfair people are like oh crypto is a scam it's like no this dude scammed crypto he tricked he lied to the crypto Community basically he was taking money and not like you know somebody would go try to buy Bitcoin on his platform and instead of buying Bitcoin he would just tell them he bought Bitcoin take the money and do something else with it altogether he was he was deceitful is very different than than saying crypto is deceitful the New York Times had this podcast the other day about this woman who got addicted to DraftKings or FanDuel or I think they're the same thing and what she told this story about how she was like a $150,000 year earner and she got addicted to it and one of the reasons why she got addicted to it was hey she just is is an addict whatever but B they assigned a an account manager to you just like you do when you want to upsell software and they're like hey I see you're uh spending on this we've got this new game called this this and this I'm willing to give you like a $500 Credit in order to get your uh you can wet your whistle a little bit and and try this out and she was like telling the story and I'm listening to this I'm like hey that's the same tactics we we did to like get people to buy ads like you like say like hey you know you're a new customer we'll hook you up this time and hopefully you get addicted to us you want to give us more money but they were doing that with this woman when she was in she eventually got into $350,000 in debt and she so she got divorc it was like a whole issue and she was like they're still like I I they're still sending me emails trying to get me to like try these new games and I want to try them so bad like they sound so awesome uh God and so it kind this whole online gambling thing kind of the bad taste of my mouth particularly because now you watch I UFC is the only by the way same thing happens in like you know bunch of different fields but also just the entire Mobile gaming Market things that look very harmless Candy Crush these all these game all the mobile gaming companies work the same way they're all hunting for whales the whole business is you go try to acquire 100,000 users and you're looking for the few users that are going to spend $100,000 inside dra and are people doing that with games where they spend 100 Grand of course yeah there I mean candy and the entire like casual Mobile gaming thing that's looks like these silly innocuous free-to-play games they're based on there's you know women in the midwest who are going to dump tens of thousands of dollars into each game that they get hooked on and those are what they work for they work for Wales they're trying to find whales whales are obviously the most profitable customer and in that you can't even win anything right it's not even like gambling where there's nothing to there's no there's money there's no money to be made in it it's just money to be spent you had friends in the gaming industry uh at least you knew them better better than my friends uh who work in the gaming industry how many times did they say they had a customer that would spend $50 or $100,000 on a game we mean how many time that's I guess like I guess how how big is the scale of of people willing to spend that much it's very large dude this is I this is how they make these games make like a billion dollars in Revenue right so there I thought it was like everyone buying like a $20 a month thing not no no no it's most players spend nothing right vast majority of players will spend nothing thing then there's a segment of people that are going to spend a small amount and there's a very small segment of people that are going to spend a huge amount and the total thing Blends together where you're like oh our po our average revenue per customer is $7 or $10 but it's not every customer spend seven to $10 it's that most spend zero a few will spend $23 on average and then a few will spend $23,000 right that's more of how it how it looks when you look at the distribution of these things that's insane Ben used to work at FanDuel and he was like yeah dude part of the program I had I think he was like employee 30 or 40 at at FanDuel he's like you know I basically oversaw this program or he was like associated with some program that was like the whale VIP White Glove service it's like oh if you're betting and losing this much money or winning even winning it's just you'll eventually lose it so if you're betting a certain volume guess what it's the Super Bowl we want to fly you out you're gonna you're gonna come visit hey we're in New York we want to invite you to this private dinner and there's a whole VIP program white white glove program where hey we got you tickets to this game and they're going to make you feel like a rock star uh degenerates sitting around the dinner table like hey what do you want to bet that the meal's going to be chicken yeah and these are willing participants these are adults now I I would say Obviously some people ruin themselves they get addicted to gambling just like people get addicted to everything social media and drugs and vape and you know there's a ton of things that people get addicted to and it's not good for them I I definitely agree with that that is that is for sure a thing and you will always see news about that because a it's happening and B it's makes for good news big company ruined this person's life right that's always going to be a thing guess what Robin Hood is designed the same way Robin Hood is literally designed like a mobile game to get you addicted to trading to get you to try to trade as much as you can they make money every time you make a trade they don't make money by you buying a lowcost index fund and holding it for 20 years they make money by getting you to buy Robin Hood gold to trade options and be day trading and so Robin Hood which is this like name of like the we're gonna steal from the rich and give to the poor is doing the exact opposite it's basically steal from the dumb and give to themselves and and that's that's what Robin Hood is so I'm gonna place a bet on this I'm gonna that's what I'm saying I'm gonna bet that Jessica Bieber is going to be having a baby boy you can't you're in the US you're not gonna be able to make a bet you can't and how do they how do they how do they track that I think it's just like your IP address right now I don't know what else they do God this is horrible and awesome I like this web I can't believe this

something earlier about Jingles catchy things and uh I was sitting in a meeting and I was sitting in a meeting and there was somebody who was prolific like if uh Kendrick Lamar wore a suit and sold B2B software that was this guy this guy had lyrics he was lyrical with his corporate slang and it got me thinking about epic corporate slang and some of my favorite greatest hits of corporate slang and I just started thinking you know we need some more and so I wanted to play a little game with you so I'd like to play a game and I texted you this I said I want you to think of this think of corporate slang that doesn't exist but it should because we're innovators here on the podcast and I want to come up with some slang I think it would be a fun claim to fame if we could just make something stick uh with corporate slang so I say we go back and forth like a rap battle with this is Corporate slang that doesn't exist but it should all right you have more than me I didn't I I came with about four or five you have a bunch of them this is right your wheelhouse so let's see what we can do though all right let me get my phone all right so the first one is going to be is the first one one man's Thanksgiving is another man's Thursday and this is for any situation where you are uh when somebody's really excited about something that you to you is just normal or even lame but hey it's their Thanksgiving it might just be Thursday to you but it's there Thanksgiving so it's kind of a way to throw shade in a corporate setting when somebody's overly excited about something that's actually just normal or average and you just say hey man one man's Thanksgiving is another man's Thursday and you just plant that seed and just leave it with them and they'll realize later that they just they just had shade thrown at them and that's a phrase that you need to use and when someone is like wait what and you're like wait you don't know what that means you know yeah like it's just one of those things they say yeah like when I was a kid I thought it was uh go out there and break an egg not go out there and break a leg you know what I mean so we'll make that a phrase or uh instead of cat like reflexes I thought it was Cadillac reflexes uh this not even corporate like these are just um like stutters that you had yeah yeah so I used to say for years like you know go out there have fun break an egg uh so we that's how you need to use this phrase um all right I've got one all right we're gonna call it bubble wrap as in when someone like do you have any employees that are overly sensitive and when you bring news to them you have to be like how are we going to phrase this so like we got to bubble wrap this yeah like all right we have to we have to tell this guy about this thing but we got to bubble wrap his ass and we got to Bubble Wrap This phrasing and we got to figure out how we can deliver this so it doesn't like totally crush him instead of just saying uh hey we're not doing that anymore your idea sucked we got to bubble wrap it so we gotta bubble wrap it okay so it's actually like a uh it's like I like what you're saying you're right but we're going to need to bubble wrap that before it goes out yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah to say in a more sensitive way not to uh freak uh a particular person out because that person when you talk to him you got to bubble wrap him before you talk to him so we're gon call Bubble Wrap like I like that that's that's strong all right I got another one aloh hamora so making email intros sucks I hate doing it it's like oh can you introduce this person I gotta say hey Bob meet meet Sean he's he's this guy he's this guy I'm I'm shortening to one word we're using the Harry Potter word homora for the spell that just is like unlocking doors so that's what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go to an email thread I'm just going to say sam Bob aora Bo boys aora fellas I've unlocked the doors here go on through and that's it I'm shortening it to one thing what uh but what's that word from Harry Potter it's a it's the spell he uses to unlock any door oh my God all right that one's extra nerdy um all right I've got another one all right so you know how on the Google Calendar the default is typically 30 minutes I hate that so we're going to call this we're going to say um so we're going to use this word when it's like hey put something on my calendar and let's syn storm it we're just going to sync storm it so it's by default it's a five minute meeting so let's just syn storm uh and you know and people say like let's let's sync up and it's always either default 30 or 60 minutes now [ __ ] that we're gonna sink storm this we're gonna get done in just about four or five minutes so hey just put something on my calendar put a little sink storm on my calendar and we're going to bang this out I love it because the other person's goingon to have no idea what you mean by that but it sounds they're supposed to know it's yeah yeah no problem love love sing storming it's my one of my favorite things to do and they're going to walk away be like what the hell am I supposed to do here we got a s storm this summer [ __ ] don't it's also nice because it's a way that like it's it's the equivalent of dating at first date and being like they're like hey let's grab dinner and you're like let's do drinks yeah yeah yeah it's actually that yeah you got a s stor it um all right what do you have all right we got to crash the boards here so this is a sports one that's that's going to be use in the corporate setting so it's when you're emailing people but you're not following up hard enough so you're you're you're emailing a prospect you're trying to do a sale and you notice there's just no follow-up there's no follow-up email so either you could just use it like you know when you're following up you could be like hey I'm just crashing the boards here or you could tell your sales team you're like hey we really got to crash the boards here fellas and they know oh that means we got to really just follow up stronger I used to use the word Blitz Greg when referring to that and then I realized that referencing uh World War I World War II Germany and their military tactics probably wasn't the the the best thing uh so a little too blond hair blueeyed to be using that one yeah yeah yeah we had a bubble we have to bubble bubble wrap Blitz and use crashing the boards that's pretty good you got um yeah so uh let's do um all right so you know how when you have a meeting and oftentimes even if it's a good idea you still it turns into a vote a lot of times uh where it's like look not everyone thinks that's a good idea so we're not going to go with it even though a lot of times the non-popular choice is the good one and so what you do is you try to like be political and get people on your side before the meeting uh and so like they vote for your idea or whatever we're going to call that landsliding um look we're going to have a meeting but we gotta Landslide this in advance and we got to get everyone to vote for our side and we gotta Landslide this meeting this idea needs to get Landslide so we're gonna call it Landslide that's powerful I like that all right this is when you got an employee who it's sink or swim you got somebody new and you need to really figure out what they're made of it's are we boiling eggs or potatoes here and it's a way to ask about somebody what they're really made of because when you like a potato starts out really hard but if you boil it it gets soft but an egg starts out soft but if you apply some heat it gets hard and you want you want eggs you don't want potatoes in your company and so that's that's where you put that out there and it's when times are getting tough and people are are wilting they're they're folding under the pressure under the Heat you just got to ask are we boiling eggs or potatoes here that's a good one I think that's an old phrase from the south haven't I heard like grandpa say that have you ever heard that I have not but maybe I got I've been told I have an old soul so maybe that's that's where they that's a good one um all right this is the last one that I have um we're GNA call all right so you know you were just in a meeting where uh a guy was saying a lot of jargon or oftentimes you'll be in a meeting and like people are lying they'll be like well we're doing great uh and it's like well we're not really doing that great and so for that we're going to use the phrase [ __ ] Bingo it's like hey are we having a meeting about what we're going to do or are we just playing [ __ ] Bingo and winning right now uh this is this meeting is just a game of [ __ ] Bingo and we're killing it and so yeah it's like Sean look you're telling me all this nonsense nonsense I think your board is full uh for [ __ ] Bingo uh this is just nonsense and so we call it [ __ ] bingo I like that one it's a way to call someone out but because it's an alliteration it just s it just bubble wrapped it just enough rap is the real winner here it sounds all right I got one last one this is similar to um situation where somebody's we're trying really hard but we're working on the wrong things feels like we're just massaging elbows here it's when you're working on a problem and you're working really hard but that you're working on something that doesn't really matter there's not enough meat on the bone there and so you're just massaging elbows it's the wrong place to be applying the effort I like that one I like that one but you have one more that I think you should you should finalize with the one about a tree so this one came from Diego uh because I was braing with him and he goes it's when you have an employee uh okay so the phrase is I think we're trying to teach a fish how to climb a tree and it's when you have an employee and you're putting them in a position that's not really their core strength they're great as a fish but they need to be in water and you putting them in a position maybe it's a a technical person you got them on sales calls and it's we're trying to put a f we're trying to teach a fish how to climb a tree here and you just be better off putting them in their natural environment and letting them succeed there than really just working against uh you know the laws of nature have you used any of these phrases yet I'm I'm gonna start this this was this was a brain this was a sink storm and so now I'm ready to start nice uh there was this Tik Tok I saw where it was this teacher and he goes my new favorite thing is to talk to my genz or whatever uh students and to say phrases and then Gaslight them that they don't know what they are he's like I just make up phrases and I think one of them was uh Pebbles he was like pebbles is like the opposite of a mountain or the opposite of a boulder so it's like hey why you crying over this problem this is a small problem it's Pebbles baby like you don't have to freak out about this and he would just like throw these phrases inck actually Pebbles is a good one and I think another one was he he was like parked so it was um it was uh when the day is going really slow or something's not moving so for example uh man it's uh we it's only lunchtime now like this day is so parked and like it's going so slow and so he would use in this Tik Tok he's like I use these phrases and I just and they look at me and they're like what does that mean and I'm like you don't know what that means like nerd you know that's what we have to do with bubble wrapped or teaching us fish how to climb a tree we're like how do you not know what that means we just have we have to act like it's normal and so had potential like first of all parked and uh Pebbles I think are Elite I don't know I I think bubble WAP is pretty Elite to be honest uh but in the YouTube comments let us know which one was uh which one you're going to actually adopt which one was was ready to go we have to have some like uh buttoned up billionaire guest or something on on and just like we start using them we're just start using them and we'll use them so many times and just like for example uh do you remember that movie Super Troopers where they're cops and they're like hey you want to play the meow game and so instead of saying now they use the like give me your license right meow uh they're like let's see if we can play let's let's see who can save me the put here uh that's what we have to do with our next guest is like so like uh dares did you like were you able to give it to him blunt or did you have to bubble wrap it you know what I mean just see do they react or do they try to roll with it yeah um are we gonna wrap up here is is that it are we are we gonna was this podcast a six storm yeah I think we got I think we got to end it there all right that's a pod dude I got a shoe horn you ever used a shoe horn is that to put your shoes on I bought like not just ASU horn but like the most intense like just for scale this thing's bigger than my torso so good so critical such an amazing I've never done one thing in my career as important as inventing the shoehorn that's my new goal I thought you were like a Crocs type of guy though what type of shoes what type of shoes are you wearing why when I try to put shoes on then it seems so difficult cuz I've just been in flip-flops all day right have you been following die workware on Twitter I do watch him why what did he say about shoes he just is inspiring me to dress better like he's just his content is so interesting and I think he's inspiring a lot of people to dress better he's just awesome is that why you have this green t-shirt from Haynes no uh it's a little bit challenging when we do the Pod but uh because you only see like nips up nips up so well we need our own Twitter account fashion for podcasters I know um best 12 garments you can buy nips up yeah it's all it just nips up it's hard to like kind of be flamboyant like some of his stuff [Music]

all right so here's the deal I have an update on a story that we talked about about two years ago partially I want to like tell you something cool partially I just want to nerd out with you on this topic because I'm shocked by [Music] it so the pandemic hits in what 2021 we all go remote and you and I start talking about something that was fascinating so basically there's this weird Vin diagram of MFM listeners there's this [ __ ] and then there's this ambitious person and they overlap to create these ambitious [ __ ] and what do ambitious [ __ ] do during the pandemic when we all go remote they do this thing called overemployed have you heard of overemployment I think is overemployed when you basically one guy has three jobs but the three jobs don't know each other yeah it's like a culture it's like this tactic it's the strategy I don't know what you call it but it's very we and it it explodes and basically a small group of people they go and get multiple jobs because they're like dude I'm working at Airbnb I'm only working 20 hours a week I get paid $150,000 I definitely can also try and get a job at Facebook right working remote was the key unlock right it was the key unlock where they could kind of hide and this story we talked about the Wall Street Journal the New York Times has talked about it's kind of been popular but I have an update on this story and it's very fascinating to me so last week Wells Fargo made an announcement where a couple dozen of their employees specifically ones who worked in the wealth management unit they laid them all off and they laid them off because they found that they were using these devices that you put your mouse on top of and it's almost like a treadmill and it makes it seem like the mouse is constantly moving on their computer and they also did it with keypads where they had this device above their keyboard where it was typing stuff and the reason they did that is because what has happened recently since the pandemic is there's been software that has absolutely exploded where it monitors employees work now this is already existed in remote first companies but now many people are remote and this type of software has exploded to the point where something like 50% of all employers who have remote workers use some type of Spy software that's not the right word but you know what I mean like some type of like productivity detection monitoring yeah Spy software is more realistic but that's but that's like interesting uh but all right and so back to that V diagram of [ __ ] and ambitious people here's what they're doing they're using these things I'm going to tell you all about them were they're exactly what what what the Wells Fargo folks were using were they're like a treadmill for your mouse so they're called Mouse jigglers and they're it's crazy now there's a company called hubstaff and uh teramind I think it's called there's two of them they have something like 5,000 companies amongst them and they are employee tracking software and they did this survey where they looked at a million of their customers or a million users using their spying tracking software and they found that roughly 7% of the million people who are using this software were using these Mouse jigglers or something like it and then the one of the CEOs of the companies they go the true number is actually probably almost certainly higher because they found out that they like were kind of being really conservative about this and I was shocked this Market is so much bigger than I ever thought and I want to tell you about a few people who are winning in this market the first one on Amazon go to Tech 8 so the word Tech and then the number eight USA so tech8 USA this is another mouse Jiggler by the way Mouse Jiggler is my new go-to disc for somebody who works at a computer all day oh he's just a mouse Jiggler it's the best there's this company called Tech 8 USA they're based in Austin Texas and what they do is you can buy these things for like $30 or $40 and you can like add like a cool design to it like what they're doing is they're basic Croc they're helping you to commit fraud or do something a little bit strange and you could add like a cool like USA flag to it or you by the way best sales pitch ever look at this thing the in the product description the last one a thoughtful gift for loved ones our undetectable Mouse mover makes excellent gifts for anybody who spends a long time at their computer whether it's a hardworking professional or a dedicated student who values convenience and efficiency this mouse juggler is a practical and thoughtful present show your appreciation help them stay productive and stressfree it's sort of like it's sort of like when the Vape makers like when I was in high school we would buy Vape machines when weed was still illegal and like they're like yeah it's for tobacco but like they put like a they somehow use like the equivalent of a wink in all of their like description look look at this like picture it's like balance your work life and it just shows someone's computer and the mouse Jiggler just ran like the person's not sitting there the mouse Jiggler is just moving the thing and it says walk the dog relax water the flowers have a party with friends while your mouse does the work for you by the way was there any doubt that the laziness device would be made in America like of course it's made here like we didn't think it was going to be made in China this thing's going to be made here well and I looked up like I was trying to figure out who's the founder and like it's like a weird business where they don't talk about it and I also think it's it'd be weird to be making these devices particularly if your company is remote like the CEO of this company's like yeah not a chance we're not going to go remote but it's really fascinating that this business is I think thriving so Tech 8 USA one of the winners in this category dude they stole your dating profile smart beautiful undetectable how yours how dare they it's pretty funny that that's that that's a thing the second thing that's thriving and this is uh the third thing is the most interesting but I'm G tell you a quick one about hubstaff so hubstaff is a software company that does the tracking to see if you're using these devices the guy started it in like 2019 as like a side project and if you Google hubstaff Revenue by the way not to be confused with today's sponsor C the ad all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show all right we're back so hubstaff the guy if you Google hubstaff Revenue you'll see that he started I think in 19 or 20 pre pandemic and it was like a side project for him oh no way 22 million in ARR yeah and when he started it he's like I just hit 10,000 in Mr I just hit uh 50,000 in Mr and then on Indie hackers he's like I just hit 200,000 in mrr pandemic hits explodes to where now it's doing 22 million in recurring Revenue who knows what's that that's worth but for sure nine figures and it started as a side project and he's completely exploded his business totally boot you know it's exploding because he used to be building in public like he had a bare metric page and if you go to their public dashboard now it's gone it got too big too big to be need to need to grow in public here but this is super impressive so this is 20 million plus AR he started this during the pandemic that is so smart it's awesome right and it looks like it's got you know 15,000 plus Pang customers wow that's impressive by the way would you something like this like for Hampton would you install something like this cuz I'm not going to lie I'm more afraid of this than I am like my wife cheating on me you know what I mean like it would break my little heart to find out that somebody on my one of my teams is just running three jobs and they got a mouse Jiggler all day and that would really make me sad and it kind of makes me want to use something like this to find out if someone's cheating on me yeah I think I'm I'm open to it I like to think that I'm our company is small enough that and we like I would you would know but yeah like it's it's a very questionable like I qu I I I have to ask myself what I be open to this and the answer is Definitely Maybe like I'm not like against it the answer is yes soon yeah so it's interesting now let me tell you the third winner of this whole thing so there was a subreddit called overemployed and overemployed at the time when we talked about it I think they're at 20 or 30,000 members on subreddit on that subreddit and it was basically they had this whole venacular of like my J1 my J2 my j3 mean they're job one job and they have all these like phrases and things like that well the moderator of that subreddit launched a website called overemployed domcom and if you go to that website he talks about his background and why he started it he also refers you to like personal finance tools which is like an affiliate play for him and he talks about like he reviews different Mouse jigglers and things like that which is like a clear affiliate play however he has a community the community is partially free partially paid it costs $300 a year I'm not sure how what percentage of people paid $300 but it's a Discord community he has 60,000 members on his Discord of people who are following the overemployed like lifestyle and I went and try to track this guy down his name's Isaac and he you don't know his last name but his LinkedIn he calls himself a career polygamist and he has a whole blog all about over employed.com and it gets who's the guy Isaac W what's his name he doesn't say so his you just it's just Isaac because he tells the story about how he had three different jobs and he got pissed off and this and it's like an US versus them like founder story but it's kind of weird right because you're not breaking the law probably but you're definitely doing something that you're probably slightly ashamed of or at least as an employer I would be unhappy with and so it's this whole Community this subculture of people that's significantly larger than I ever imagined and they're talking about these things openly and it's very fascinating I went to the website welcome to the secret door to Financial Freedom insane I've always wanted the secret door and uh and he's tapped into my needs this is crazy work two remote jobs reach Financial Freedom that's the uh the slogan for this website this is crazy dude it's not crazy that this like I knew this was happening but the SAR special here was to go back and check back in on this thing that we talked about two years ago and go find this guy's blog and community and hub staff and the 22 million in ARR it's crazy that there's a whole ecosystem ecosystem come come up around this one lifestyle right like you had the 4-Hour Work week which is delegation Automation and basically like 8020 prioritization and now you have overemployed which is like the messed up cousin to the 4-Hour Work Week where he's like look just lie to your lie to your company you're gonna work the same eight hours but for three different companies that I'm s I'm surprised I'm surprised I'm not surprised at the same time at how popular this is and let me give you one more and what I'm about to show you it's kind of like the equivalent of teaching your children about safe sex but really hoping that they don't do it like they don't have sex until whatever and they're like sex sounds awesome I'm going to go do it because there's this guy called the overemployed guy.com and he I I click the about page and he has this long history of like how he got J1 J2 j3 and part of the story he's got this quote he's like I had a bad job and I was upset frustrated I wanted more money and then it wasn't until I heard the host of my first million mention this new trend of people in Tech working multiple jobs simultaneously that I was woken up to this badass community and and this is like the second largest site amongst the overemployed look at this guy's logo by the way it's the dude with three laptops open I think that's one of the the Cardinal rules of this is like you must use one machine per thing because they're going to be tracking you so you have to uh have different laptops and he's wearing a hoodie and a mask in where it's like clearly we all kind of agree that this is a little bit strange that you're doing this and so I wanted to bring this story up because I'm not shocked but I'm still shocked Al also can I get your take on this because if somebody's listening to this this is back to the safe sex thing somebody's listening to this you know we find it fascinating that this is going on but me and you have zero desire to do this zero and maybe that's because all right we kind of already made it in a way we sold our companies we don't we don't have any jobs we don't need it we don't need a job period but if you were young again would you do this like if you were just working at one job and you saw this would you be tempted to go down this path no I mean I would be tempted like I'm tempted to do anything bad like drugs but like at like at the back of my head I'm like I this is wrong no I think it's wrong I think that I would not be career Molly yeah like I like maybe occasionally it's all right but you oftentimes regret it no this goes against my ethical code uh I am not I'm not in favor of this are you are you no not at all not not just the ethical side because the ethical side I think it sounds okay but I have like a relationship with the people I work with you know what I mean like it's not a it's not this nameless faceless giant big Corp that doesn't care about me like I've always worked in you know usually smaller environments where you know we're a team on a mission together and if I was doing some other Mission while we're on our mission that would feel like a like a pretty deep betrayal but that's just I always worked in that type of environment the second thing though is I just don't think it's a good strategy I think it's a bad strategy if you are willing to be clever and and hardworking enough to figure this out like dog just just either start your own business or crush it at one job and you'll make more money and work less than you will having to do this like thing and have to juggle this in your subconscious at all times about these lies that you're living right like living a lie is very taxing emotionally but also you don't need to do this like one great job or one big effort if it's your own company will pay off like go just go up the ladder in your own company or start your own company if you're willing to do all this [ __ ] I I just think it's bad strategy it goes back to the the thing I said other day like the dumbest person in the world is a professional blackjack player if you're smart enough to be a professional blackjack player but you're dumb enough to use it on a game that's rigged against you like that's on you you you are the the the wrong middle of the vent diagram of super smart and hardworking and picks terrible games and I think this is an example of that you are super smart and hardworking to to figure this out to set this up but you're playing a dumb game and what's the thing play stupid games Win stupid prizes that's to me that's what this is to me I don't want to J1 J2 j3 that's that's a bad idea I remember in high school I had this uh buddy who basically took a a water bottle like a Evan or whatever water bottle and they undid the logo like they took the plastic off of the bottle and then on the inside they wrote all the equations for the math test that they needed to memorize and it was beautifully done it was the handwriting was perfect the equations were even at sometimes in code in case they got caught that you couldn't decipher it and I was like how long did that take you like it took hours but like I made this perfect thing and I remember thinking like you could have just studied like if you just studied like you would have got you probably the alcome would be the same and it's it's way less risk that's sort of like what's going on here exactly Perfect Analogy Perfect story so that's my story on overemployed I thought it was fascinating do we have a guy by the way today's sponsor who was overemployed a little bit where he had a side hobby was that a good transition that's a pretty good transition all right so we could have overemployed we could have doing multiple things when I first heard about what the CEO was doing I kind of groan because I invested in this company and the company was doing well and then the CEO launches a newsletter and I'm like bro why do you need a newsletter do you really need a newsletter and it's excusable because today's sponsor is beehive they make the easiest platform to create newsletters so on one hand it made sense he was using his own product and that seemed cute but I didn't really fully get it until I talked to him and I tried to understand why is he doing this and so this is the story of um Tyler Den starting big desk energy so basically we've talked about this before there's a great playlist on Spotify if you need work music called Big desk energy and it's this guy Tyler dank founder of beehive and he just made a playlist of songs he listens to while he works and I like music but I have poor taste so I used to use this thing all the time because I was like great I I don't know how to find cool music like Tyler is kind of a cool guy he's cool looking guy he's a young guy he's like a New York Manhattan hip kid yeah but he like he lives in the on the beach somewhere like he's he's a cool dude so I got to borrow his music I was using his playlist but then his playlist became a newsletter okay interesting why and now it has he was like I want to do this because I want to dog food my own product I want to build in public and I want to just live and breathe all the pain points of my customers so that I could be better at Building Product when he said that I realized oh this makes a lot of sense because too many times do the product builders get so busy they get disconnected from the actual product usage the analogy I'll give is every night my kids I don't put them to bed My Wife puts our kids to bed now we have like a new bedtime routine where she's able to do all three kids at once and so the two older kids they want to eat fruit in bed every night no matter what we fed them for dinner they're like can we have fruit okay so I have to do this like 20 minute fruit cutting exercise I'm cutting apples and grapes and strawberries I put it in a bowl I make it look nice I go deliver it to the bed they're so excited they're watching their their little bedtime stories or whatever and they eat the fruit and I've been doing this for like 3 weeks now and then finally yesterday my daughter was just like hey can Mama cut the fruit and I was like what why dad always cuts the fruit what do you mean and she's like well you do it bad like what do you mean she goes well you do it like the way you cut the strawberry like I can't eat it like that they're too big and I was like what do you mean why didn't you say anything she's like well you're not there you're downstairs cutting the fruit and then you hand it to me and like by the time I try to eat it you're not there for me to tell you and so for three weeks I had there no feedback loop I didn't know how she likes her strawberries cut and for too many CEOs that's that's them with their product they don't know how the customers like the strawberries cut and one thing that Tyler did that was very very smart for beehive was launch his own newsletter figure out how to grow it to 30,000 figure out how to monetize it do all of the things that a user of his product would want to do he did it as the CEO and he told me that has been huge for them on their product development because now he could just look at the road map and be like that [ __ ] doesn't matter these things do because he's actually lived it breeds it he knows how the users want their strawberries cut well and he built a lot of this at morning Brew which is they like took a lot of like what they learned there but even then he was just the growth guy he wasn't the guy actually writing the thing sending the thing getting the feedback from customers it's very different when you fully play it out so the guy's cool they've got taste this is awesome oh yeah this is all built in beehive all right this is pretty badass all right I'm on board I just signed up so if you want to create a newsletter or you want to grow your newsletter go to beehive.org business opportunity he goes no it was a magnet because I realized that anybody who has a cool personal website anybody who cares enough to make a personal website you're my people he's like so I just made a tool that was useful for them it's not even that expensive it's pretty cheap I undercut the market price it's not the best business in the world but it was amazing because it brought all these people who I I realize that's the highest like signal thing if you have your own personal website I probably [ __ ] with you like I I like you my signal if I like you is if you have uh an income north of $2 million and also you listen to Kid Rock if you do those two things if you do those two things you're me you're probably interesting um all right what do you got I wanted to read you something so I think here's another little life hack for you one of the great things about the internet is it is such a wide Buffet of content I think a mistake most people make is that they go to the fast food chains of the internet you go to your Facebooks your Instagrams your Tik toks and that's you just make a diet a Content diet of only getting information from big fast food chain social networks I'm a believer that your info diet matters do you agree with that is that something you think about or or care about yeah I my fear is getting influenced by the wrong people and I know that you you talked about this info diet for a long time and it kind of influenced me yeah and I I had this thing I said I'm I'm I'm going on the intentional internet which is basically I'm not going to just eat whatever the algo feeds me when I log in or I open up a tab I'm going to think about like what am I trying to get out of this session right now and then I start opening up Kindle or I start opening up different things it's the intentional internet so I have this idea I'm going to create this like food pyramid of like the info diet so the way the food pyramid was like you know you have your carbohydrates your proteins your dairies whatever I think there's the same thing for the info diet which is there's probably some PL you should have some proportions you should have of different types of information if you want to really like feed your brain in a way that's going to make your brain healthier one of the cool superfoods I'll call it like Kale like these nutrient-dense superfoods is find a baller and then go find their early blog before they made it I love doing that and so I was doing this over the weekend and me and band we were looking up and we looked up uh do you know who Brian coppelman is is he a famous VC no uh there is a Josh cman I think Brian cman is the guy who created billions and oh yeah yeah yeah yeah he's he's like a showrunner in Hollywood yeah and so we were we were talking about Brian cman for this other thing and then we went and we looked up like does he publish anywhere does he post his thoughts anywhere and we went and we looked up and you basically want to find things that are like you know five plus years old and it's his blog it's his old interview it's the that Coursey taught at NYU you try to find something like that so you have to give a shout out to his blog brian.com it's just a plain white and black blog this is an awesome find and they're very simple posts they're not like either the they're not the most mind-blowing things either which is in itself kind of an interesting thing it's like wow this guy who achieved so much it's not like he's writing this Shakespearean genius stuff that I couldn't have thought of it's like wow this is a guy kind of like me that made it in a really unique way so anyways I'm I'm G read you the one post write what fascinates you that's the title so I'm going to read it to you he goes this seems simple right of course we should write about what fascinates us and what we obsess over but so many people approach writing and especially screenwriting as if it could be gamed figured out or strategized and if you're somebody who could do that congratulations rock on although I wouldn't waste that kind of strategic brain power on Show Business there's problems to be solved out there in the real world if you're that type of person go figure out how to Arbitrage energy resources in a way that motivates buyers and sellers to create a more Equitable Market or something I don't know because I don't think of it that way but obviously you do for the rest of us we need to calculate less we need to look inside to find our subject matter or outside at the world we see but through prism of enthusiasm prism of enthusiasm he says meaning we must find subjects that are personally animating inspiring and engaging to us because once we do we have a shot at making them inspiring and engaging for others as well because when the story is important to you when it fascinates you when the passion is tangible the reader senses it and without even knowing why it gives you the benefit of the doubt you have a story to tell of course and it still takes an enormous amount of effort and concentration but the huge collateral benefit of telling stories that genuinely fascinates you is this forcing yourself to sit down and actually doing the work is much easier than when you're writing something because you think it's marketable because you think it could sell or it's in a genre that's in currently in demand so calculate less write your obsessions and have a better chance of a getting something really written and B turning your screenplay into something that excites and engages the reader this is awesome and he did this in 2013 over 10 years ago yes and I think this same advice by the way works for businesses as well there's one way of doing business which is the calculated strategic approach you look at markets you create a market map you try to identify a gap and then you're going to reverse engineer something and then you're going to try to do demand testing and AB testing and you're trying to validate your idea and blah blah blah blah blah and the other is you work on things that Fascinate you either it's a new technology that you think is really cool or it's a new lifestyle that's being you know promoted that you're curious about you're fascinated by and maybe there's not enough products for people who want that lifestyle or maybe it's a problem that you have that you kind of get obsessed over you're like wait a minute am I crazy why am I the only one who's not okay with things the stat quo here like that's where the greatest companies get built and the greatest successes is and it's actually easier it's easier because you're excited about it and it's easier because you actually care about the problem you're gonna actually figure out the solution and so I just thought that this was awesome advice for Content look at today's podcast like I'm telling you about a you know 11-year-old blog post and you're telling me about a subreddit that's popping off and this these these bloggers that are overemployed like the reason this podcast works because we talk about what fascinates us and it's because of that it's not something any anybody could compete with because nobody else has the same weird taste palette that we have but if they did their weird taste palette they would find Their audience and it's really hard to stay unique as you get bigger whether whatever you're doing as it gets more successful everyone wants you to tone it down and it's incredibly challenging to not give into that we have this right now you've seen it me and slack I'm on a rampage because I'm like dude our titles and thumbnails that are on YouTube are too YouTube optimized they're calculated it's this is going to get somebody to click instead of this is how we want it to feel or this is what would make me interested it's like no no what would make the mass populace interested well it's like maybe we don't necessarily need the mass popularist maybe we need the type of people that we want to attract because they're the ones that are going to actually like the podcast because they're the ones that actually will will resonate with it and stick with it and I think that we have made a mistake in in part of our world which is I don't think I think we kept the content pretty pure and sacred to what we want but I think the packaging we've sort of tried to sell out and calculate try to like maximize clicks and Views not trying to roll that back yeah I agree with that by the way and that's also why I like a lot of YouTubers because there's not a committee usually it's just one person where he's like this is my show I'm gonna do whatever the hell I want to do right like there's this guy followed named whist and Diesel he's this guy he's not a kid anymore but he's this guy in Indiana and he does the stupidest craziest stuff and he's hilarious but he's a representation of like the most interesting YouTubers who don't really EV they don't really sell out and they keep it real and it makes them way more successful yeah I love it let me give you an example of a person who fits this mold wonderfully so you and I are a fan of Peter levels he fits this mold perfectly I saw that he shared something recently and I went down this Rabbit Hole so there's this guy I'm G to struggle to say his name big time I I believe he's French I I don't know exactly Clement P I can't say his name dude look at his name do you see it honestly I was gonna make fun of you but that is not any picol Piccola picap I think his name is pilipa so listen to what this guy did so I looked at his website his website is kind of hard to figure out so he was a or he is a DJ like a DJ in clubs but I guess while he was DJing and trying to pay the bill bills he was also a software developer where he would like make random software he just released something two or three days ago that's amazing so this is sick yes so let me tell the story a little bit so we talked about photo so photo is a free basically um I I'll call it a clone of Photoshop but I don't know if it's exactly a clone but it definitely started that way so photo is a free version of Photoshop created by this guy named Ivan and Ivan was he's one of these Indie hacker guys where he was really open about it so he built this uh Photoshop clone which is obviously Photoshop is huge and it took off right away and I think in 20121 he posted that he made a million dollars in Revenue 90% of that being ads and then 2023 he said that he was now making close to $300,000 a month from this photo website and it's huge it blew up it has 15 million visitors a month yeah massive massive massive massive and for all I know it's just one person well this other guy we're g to call him CL because I can't say his last name what photoed did to photoshop he did with Adobe After Effects and he calls it pey move or pey mve what do you how do you think he pronounced that I have no idea [ __ ] Mo I don't know [ __ ] mo so you'll have it's p i k i m oov and you have to go to this website so basically this guy he posted it on Hacker News and then he posted it on Reddit and Twitter and it blew up on all three of those places and he said basically he was like I'm on this uh Linux machine and I've been trying to like use the photo after effect and it wasn't really working and it wasn't doing what I needed it to do so for the last year I basically just built this version of it for myself and it's free and now I'm letting the world use it and he was very underwhelming with his announcement he was like so here's this thing you guys can use this on Twitter it gets something like two million views Hacker News it's the number one post Reddit it's massive it's completely blown up and it is so awesome that one person built this thing so you went to the website what did you see it I mean it looks like after effects and it just says free free alternative to editors such as Adobe After Effects web based nothing to install works on Windows Mac and Linux you can do everything you can do on after effects and your files stay on your computer they're not uploaded to a server when we talked about photop I think we've talked about photop a few times it was one of the earliest episodes of this podcast you you had showed me photo or I showed you photop I don't remember what it was but that was a kind of like a miracle looking product these are like the um radioactive Indie Indie hackers like the Indie hackers that got bit by the bug and now have superpowers where one man can recreate all of Photoshop like every feature of Photoshop in a browser and it actually works and he's willing to give it away for free and just maintain it himself for the rest of his life and now somebody's doing it with After Effects this is super impressive impressive it's incredibly impressive and he tells the story where on Twitter people are like this is amazing how on Earth did you do this and he's like I just did it on nights and weekends by myself and I figured it out dude this is sick by the way look look at this so somebody in Hacker News the comments they go as a motion designer I'm curious what feature what features does this have that after effects doesn't and then somebody came in and says I'd say the main feature it lacks is that is a subscription payment requirement so good it it's awesome and it was a total underwhelming launch in that he didn't like overhype it he just said he put it out in the world but it was one of those products that you go to it and you're like it's sort of like seeing like a huge Lego setup where you're like yes yeah what a great analogy the fact that you spent a year putting this together I'm impressed I don't have to know anything about this but this is just epic just for being epic right do you know what I mean instant instant internet respect for for this this is so impressive I'm never going to use this because I don't use After Effects anymore thank God but this is awesome this guy has my eternal respect and uh I'm glad we're sharing it here I'm going to Tweet this out also this is so sick it's really awesome and if you Google his name you can't find photos of him so most all of his photos they're not even like avatars they're just like silly they're like I think it's a a sharp or a whale or something it's his Avatar like you really can't find a lot of pictures about this guy and if you go to his website there's nothing there he barely explains who he is and so this is like a true oneof one these rare individuals that I particularly love and I know you love too where it's like these this almost it's almost like a hacker but they're not doing anything wrong you know what I mean right it's it's like a weird subculture of people that I'm obsessed with where they're they're artists who know how to uh program is basically what they are and you can't find anything about this guy he like he's doing it almost For Art's Sake how long did it take him to make this do you know it he said ear 2023 so that would be a year and a half a year very talented that's cool it looks great I don't know anything about after effects because I don't use it either but I go to the website and I'm like this is special do you know what I mean okay oh wow okay all right I'm impressed this is great okay what do you want me to do I have two topics you pick the Ryan Sant show or my self-driving car experience self-driving car for sure okay so self-driving car uh so I went into San Francisco last week for a couple meetings and the new way Mo wh app is now open for everybody so I don't know are you like fully in the loop on what's going on basically there's there's actual self-driving cars that just drive around San Francisco like taxis and it's happening and it's not like limited or fake in some way it's not a demo you push a button it shows up it's got your name written on the top of it you push unlock it opens up there's no driver in there you get it and it takes you to your destination it is Magic I think it's awesome it works super well I would have been pretty nervous to get inside this but I had so many friends who've been using because they were in the ba the private beta that were like dude this thing is so good it's so good it's better than Tesla's autopilot by far this is this is really really good so I got in I feel like here's a couple of thoughts on this I don't know exactly what I want to say but I just wanted to come to you with a few few random thoughts you tell me you help me make sense of this so the first thought is just I can't believe this is happening like I can't believe in my lifetime this is just going to happen where we're just going to shift from like nobody drives cars and it's so obvious the first time you get in one like I had to take an Uber back and literally it was comical it was like the worst Uber experience you could have it was like 100 degrees in the car he wouldn't open the windows and he wouldn't turn on the AC and every time I asked him a question he was like super grumpy and I was like I just never want to have a driver in the car again I just I went from the wayo seamless private you know uh fully iny control autonomous experience to like back to what felt like a ricka in India like it felt terrible and so I can't believe this is happening I feel like this should be a much bigger deal and nobody's really talking about it it's not that it is a secret but I feel like nobody cares that's very strange to me because the coolest AI thing that that's going to happen is that the cars are going to drive themselves and then we're just going to sleep eat play video games and chill inside cars from now on and nobody's going to get in car accidents that's going to be amazing and I feel like nobody's really excited that we're now like right here on the cusp because if this can do this all throughout San Francisco and San Francisco is kind of a complicated place like it's a city Street there's people walking at jay walking everywhere there's construction that's that means it's going to work in a lot of places so I can't believe this happening I was surprised that it cost as much or more than an Uber and I was totally fine with it I thought that the whole point of this self-driving car was going to be that it's going to be cheaper and I think eventually it will but right now these cars are very expensive but I was more than happy to pay a premium to go in the driver list experience which was very surprising to me uh because I thought the reason I would want it was because it's it's less expensive expensive it's just better I don't mind paying more how much more expensive was it like 20 30% more expensive oh that's nothing yeah not not bad obviously there's a little bit you know there's some small hiccups meaning it's like more polite so for example if you're standing right there it won't just stop in the middle of the road block everybody's traffic just to let you in It'll like try to it'll go up 30 feet and pull over and you got to walk 30 feet you're like ah I can't believe I couldn't just stop all of the street traffic to get into my car car so there's like little things like that that are kind of annoying but actually understandable but man I was impressed have you been in one of these no but I'm looking forward to it because I have a Tesla and I hate my Tesla I think a Tesla is a horrible car I hate it which one do you have the X and I think it's horrible but there's one feature about it that makes it absolutely worth it which is the self-driving stuff which you keep your hands on there but I drive that car all the time and I only use the self-driving I am significantly more comfortable with that than my wife or me driving the car I think I think it is way safer so from now on all of the cars that I'm buying in the future are going to have some type of driver assist and it's so much better let me correct you in the future you're just not going to buy cars you're just going to push a button and the car is going to take you where you want you're never going to need to own a car yeah I could see that so there's something like 40,000 deaths in America from car accidents and I I I there people will still die because this but it's going to be drastically reduced additionally if you've ever been in traffic have you ever like studied what causes traffic sure haven't well like it's like a like like if you ever see like those weird gifs or on like how stuff works well you'll be like here's how like a traffic jam starts and you see like one person abruptly stop which causes another person to abruptly stop and then like it's like a train train re train reaction and it's like a really weird it's more of a a psychological problem almost than anything where you're like wait why this person stopping which caused this which this and it's really fascinating but when you think about traffic that can basically be not solved for but incredibly improved upon because your margin of air it's not a human making that mistake you're like no I know I can drive within 10 feet of the driver in front of me because I know that I'm like I'm not just gonna hit the break too late whatever that's going to be solved we're going to Save hours and hours and hours every month because of this type of stuff and let alone the lack of death so I'm like incredibly excited about it yeah and parking you know I think cars have only like a sub 10% utilization rate meaning 90% of the time a car is just sitting idle doing nothing and that's going to change because if a car can drive itself it's going to go instead of sitting idle it's going to go and earn money for you it's going to go drop people off and earn cash and it's not going to be stay parked so when utilization rate goes up you don't need as many cars total because now each car is being used more so now you have way less car car s being used way more which means way less parking which means way less buying cars it's a it's a big change that's coming right in addition to the lifestyle change of we got in a self-driving car and you're talking about like you know you have to keep your hands on the wheel for the wayo thing you just sit in the back you're just chilling the wheel is just turning itself you don't even you don't even look outside we had a full meeting and we could talk about numbers and everything because there's no driver sitting there and we just it was a productive 20 minutes it was great and if I wanted to just sleep I could have just fully slept I could have done anything that that's amazing because I don't know how much time the average person spends in a car but like and average probably not even right it's probably like of the people who really have a commute they're probably spending like two three hours a day in a car versus you know what will become you know e either an incredibly productive or relaxing time to be going from one place to another I I I remember I would explain this to my parents or in-laws and they're like well aren't you afraid that you're in this machine and its controlling thing and I always say well no because at least I'm sitting at the wheel so I can take over so there's like I'm part of the loop but number two it's like well are you afraid when you get into an elevator right like I'm not I'm not afraid when I get in an elevator I trust that that button is going to do the right thing and it's going to bring me where I want to go and it's not just going to drop me I'm also not afraid when I fly on an airplane you know the pilot is sitting there at the seat but it's like an autopilot plane so no I'm not afraid now I I am a little bit nervous because the technology is new but like in 10 years when or a lot of times people like this is never going to be a thing it's like no it's definitely going to be a thing in 10 years it's going to be significantly better than it is now and it's pretty good now so yeah I'm not afraid of it at all and I'm incredibly bullish from now on the cars that I buy on a daily basis are all going to be the have some type of driver assist like you use it on your Tesla and you're like this is the way the world should be at least that's what I think what about this uh which one you want to do you do one more uh let's do the ran show so I binge watch the new um it's called owning Manhattan it's just like a random Netflix show it's nothing like super special no most people wouldn't care about it I I liked it it wasn't like the best show ever but I I happened to binge watch it I stayed up till like four in the morning watch this so who is this guy I just know he's a silver hair guy that sells real estate yeah he's a real estate broker and he was one of the like kind of high-end brokers in New York he got famous because he was on a show called million-dollar listing since I think he was like 25 years old so he spent basically a decade on TV but it was like Bravo TV and it was him and a bunch of other Brokers and what happened is he leaves the show in like the 10th season and he takes a little break and then he comes back with his own Netflix show and obviously it was kind of like selling Sunset was this huge hit reality show and the genre of like real estate reality became like a thing they're selling OC they're selling Miami they're selling Sunset there's like a whole bunch of these like real estate shows so he comes back and he's got one called owning Manhattan and it's basically the story is Ryan Sant who's like the uh Ryan seest of the real estate World he's like this super good you know super good-looking guy who loves to be on TV he's just made for who's got great skin and sells real estate that's the guy and so he takes this show and he's um the quest is basically he leaved he he left his brokerage he starts his own brokerage firm so you know you have SES and you have compass and he's trying to create Sant like his own brokerage and he hires up like 200 or 300 agents now and the show is following him trying to go trying to become the number one brokerage firm in New York and I think they only serve like the New York area they're not even they're not Nationwide but he's trying to become number one in New York which is the number one real estate market in the world and I got to say the show is pretty interesting and it's interesting for a couple reasons number one uh you know he's he's good at TV meaning he's kind of obnoxious but it grows on you he's like obnoxious but then it starts to get better uh but also all the agents you know it's a perfect cocktail it's like you have house porn luxury like luxury real estate you have big dollars flying around deals that are closing or not closing then you have the agents who are like you know peacocking they each have try to have their own brand and personality and try to be the best in their own way and then you have like the drama of like a a soap opera or like a you know reality why is he obnoxious like it's almost like his style like his style is you know he tries to do cocky funny basically I don't know I do a bad impression of it but he'll be like like real estate is hard not for me I mean I make it look easy but for other people it's hard and he like every interview he's doing that and so at first you're just like all right whatever but over time you know you do get to you get to see the guy sweat because the guy you know the way the show makes it feel is that he's hanging on by a thread each each of these deals has to go through otherwise bad things happen which is you know just normal TV drama he gives off the vibe that he's like super Alpha where it's almost like you have a stereotype in your head of uh like a like a highroller hedge fun guy but for real estate yeah and also kind of Metro also so he's not like just Macho he's like he's like kind of got like both sides of it where he's like kind of like got the style and the fashion and the like the the light touch but then he's also like a Cutthroat killer trying to win he's like a wake up at 5:00 a.m. work out eat healthy at the office by seven at you know what I mean he's like that type of guy where it's just like he he's intense exactly and so I wanted to read you so why did I want to share this really there's two things I wanted to share first is hey it's a TV show I liked if you're looking for a TV show you might like this one that's the little thing but the bigger thing would be um there's a moment in the episode so in show so he uh I I'll just give away a little bit of the show so there's one young agent who's basically the kind of like controversial guy on the scene he's talented but he's an [ __ ] right okay that's a great character so this guy who's like fully tatted up he used to be like a model in Norway or something like that and so super good-look super tatted up guy who's super cocky and arrogant he's only 25 years old but he's he's like well why would he's like if you're young if you made it on YouTube or you're a rapper or whatever he's like you don't want to buy from this like and he's like talking about his coworker he's like some like baldheaded used car salesman looking guy in a in a cheap suit you want to buy from me he's like I'm just the Next Generation like people want to the next generation of rich people want to buy with me and so he's uh he's like very cocky and whatever and Ryan believes in this guy because he's clearly talented but he's also like dude why are you such like a jerk around the office like you're making my life hard by being a jerk his name's Jonathan I'm looking at Jonathan he rides a motorcycle everywhere and he's by the way guy is fantastically dressed at all times like I I tried to find this guy's like stylist like who is this guy's stylist cuz this guy's got great style dude he has neck tattoos I'm not buying real estate from a neck tattoo guy but you kind of want to like it's kind of like when the bad boy likes you yeah all of us were like me yeah he's giving me attention there's a certain part of you that wants that dude if you have a tattoo that goes over your Adam's Apple I don't know like I don't I don't know that's the line yeah like I'd want to hang out with you maybe but I don't know if I want to do business with you I mean you you clearly visible in a turtleneck you got problems all right and what about this guy so there's a scene at the end I just thought there was a great quote so uh Ryan is kind of confronting this guy because he's been you know causing a bunch of drama and he says something I thought was just really great he goes you spend so much of your time trying to get noticed instead of spending your time trying to be great if you spent half the time just trying to be great you'd be so great that everybody would have to notice you and I just thought that was just a wonderful line a wonderful quote that I feel like I could have you know forward did that in an insulting way to like 10 people I know in life people who were very active on social media and it's like instead of trying so hard to get noticed just try to be great if you spent half the time just just trying to be great you would be so great that everybody would have to notice you like that guy who did the after effects thing he he could have tried to be you know promoting himself and blogging and doing all this stuff and instead he just did one great thing and we all have to notice him we all have to follow him we want to be be a part of this guy's World versus him trying to push his agenda out there and I just thought that was a great quote that a lot of people need to hear I am going to read between the lines here are you becoming introspective lately is this like a thing are you you're you're are you trying to work through like what type of man you want to be uh because I kind of I kind of like it to be honest I'm doing the work as they say you know uh someone made a comment to me where they said like you know Sam I could tell what phase of life you are in uh because I listen to the podcast and I hear what you're talking about and who you're getting influenced by they were like before you're having children before you even said that you're going to have a kid like I kind of guessed it based off what you're talking about I'm kind of doing the same with you where it's actually exciting to see like the quotes or in this case the quote that you're interested in in you're like thinking like that's how I should live my life a little bit more do you know what I mean of course of course and I think that that's cool if you spot it you got it is the the rule right and it's like I think this is insightful because I have the problem that this Insight cures right it resonates with me because there's a part of this that is true for me and true for people I know that I care about you know that I want to you know I wish I could you know shake them to hear it too and so yeah I'm very into this you also if you read the comments of our YouTube you also have a large fan base of young men who look up to you and think that you're cool which you are cool uh they would be shocked at how basic [ __ ] your TV choices are cuz you you are you so true Sean and my wife will like text about like the challenge or like and I know you're a bachelor guy or whatever the I don't even know what these shows are but you I love that this is the one part of you where you are a mainstream type of person and you're into this stuff I just try to keep in touch with the common folk you know yeah I don't know if this is common folk but I love how simple some of your tastes are look you're a very complex person with deep taste and a and a and a rich personality but this is the one part for your you're just like the rest of us everybody's like that right you like to go build Legos in your free time like when we are when the light when we want to switch the light off we don't want it just dim we want it off it's like when I want to relax I want to go Mindless I want to veg I want to just I want to go completely and indulge in a in a non-intellectual Pursuit because I already do it and even then you could see like I somehow turn that into like podcast content and lessons for life when I'm supposed to just be looking at people's pretty outfits and stuff and uh you know I can't really fully turn it off but I try to I try to go and and just do the stuff that I truly enjoy without trying to make it also be cool and um intelligent this guy Ryan by the way he gives off so I've seen him talk before and I found him I found him very off-putting at first where I'm like I feel like you're like Grant Cardone or something you're G to like sell me something or you're trying to scam me and then I got to know him and I'm like Oh no you're I think you're the real deal you're you're just intense and uh you're you're you're legit he has a company called sell it so sell it.com have you seen sell it.com no so basically it's like a course in one-on-one training business that you give to your real estate agents and that could go one of two ways it it could come off like scammy and and kind of bottom feeder type of stuff when I go to the website I do not get that Vibe at all I get like it's like it's legit so he owns I believe his real estate brokerage term is incredibly successful but this company I have heard rumors that this business is doing something like 30 or $40 million a year revenue and um he's building up like a legit media Empire of courses I buried the lead of why I wanted to talk about the show the reason I want to talk about the show I watched it and I go oh my God he's doing the Kardashian model yeah but instead of selling like $9 lip gloss he's selling $9 million Apartments this is genius and what I mean by that is he is using the Netflix show as the greatest marketing vehicle for his own agency so it's like he he has hit media that creates you know more business and it is perfect content Market fit and I just thought wow this is incredible this is just like the Kardashians have done where they use media to then build their their beauty Empire he's doing this to build his real estate Empire or his sales Empire and the the the funniest tweet I saw on this was somebody goes the greatest sale ran never did was selling Netflix an eight 8 Hour infomercial without them realizing it because the show is an infomercial for him for his brokerage for his agents and it is going to be it's tremendous right it's the way that HubSpot treats this podcast it's negative C this show entertains you and it's profitable for them so it's good media and good business and once I saw this I was like Wow applying that to one of the highest ticket items in the world a home luxury homes at that that is a very very powerful com combination and you're just going to keep seeing examples of this content Market fit happening where people can figure out a way to make really juicy Standalone entertainment on its own that is going to then inherently Market you and your business this is you know an incredible job of that and you and I uh he you're really close to this person he bought his apartment I think from him from Ryan yeah yeah we have a couple friends that I bought from him yeah and I asked my buddy or our buddies uh about the experience and they're like yeah he showed up and he was there like showing me around this $8 million apartment and he was real like he was he was like actually doing the work and so I think this guy's a Workhorse yeah yeah yeah he's got the New York New York energy right the New York hardore overdrive overwork Personality yeah no I I'm a big fan of this guy he's he definitely was one of the types of people who I I learned about him and I'm like I'm not I don't like you at all and then I start learning more and more I'm like oh you're awesome you're legit yeah you come to respect the hustle I respect this guy a lot I think he's the man I think that um kind of like having um I've said this before but it's kind of like having Adam's Apple Tattoo not for me but I still respect it uh that's kind of like what this guy is where I'm like I can't imagine grinding that hard because he gets after it but I love that he exists that he does this so yeah I'm I actually do like this guy a lot all right right on I think that's it all right that's the pod [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I tweeted this out a long time ago I said I have a new hero and his name is Dan Porter you're here and today you're going to show people why that is true listen me I wasn't a gamer and I made a pretty popular game I didn't know a lot about ticketing and I started the first live event ticketing company I like sports I'm not a sports wizard I don't know you just do [ __ ] you're fun of [ __ ] talk to can you talk about a couple of the things that you did intentionally that you think helped build the brand the one second piece of advice I would give is [Music] that I'll start with a few facts number one this is a guest I have been waiting for to come on the podcast for years and the reason why is because I have Dan you don't know this but I've had all these fantasies these entrepreneurial fantasies in my life there's a part of me that's like you know what one day I'm going to make a hit social app and 100 million people are going to use it I'm going to sell it for hundreds of millions of dollars you've done that I have this other fantasy that no no no I'm going to go change education I'm gonna start a big nonprofit I'm gonna be the leader of that I'm gonna help grow that thing I'm gonna help change the way the Education Works in America you've done that part of me wants to go to Hollywood and work with the power Brokers the people who are who are in that world you've done that part of me wants to create a a brand that's like you know part of the culture that uh that you know in the in the World of Sports uh takes off you've done that part of me wants to own a sports League you've done that you have done basically all the things that I've ever wanted to do I tweeted this out a long time ago I said I have a new hero and his name is Dan Porter nobody knew who the hell I was talking about nobody knew why I was saying that I didn't give any context but you're here and today you're going to explain to the people you're going to show people why that is true uh as an amazing intro especially for somebody whose Twitter game is as lame as mine I uh I appreciate that I would some text that with uh clearly jack of all trades master of none well I want to start with the story uh because your stories are legendary you came to our our basketball camp Camp FFM and uh you didn't even play basketball which is the best part you were my favorite person there and you didn't even play basketball which is the the funniest part can you tell the story of uh OMG pop and what happened there yeah so uh OMG pop was a Gaming website built entirely in Flash started with this incredibly creative guy Charles Morman who grew up playing game Boys in his garage and was like I wish the internet could connect us to play together uh and we made a ton of really fun games and we actually had success and it's a weird story because in some ways like we imagine that businesses either succeed or fail but what happens like if you're in the middle and we had millions of people who played our games the problem is that Farmville came out and they 100 million people who played their games and all of a sudden millions of people who played your games was kind of way Lamer than a 100 million people who played your game on Facebook and we we did our thing but then the world changed and it was Facebook games and it was all these other things and so at what point do you come back to the board and you're just like well we're you know we're kind of running out of money and they're like well why do we want to invest in something that is good but not great uh so I remember we went back and we were like Okay so let's say that we cut all the snacks like how much runway would that increase for us um and the answer was one day and at some point you're just like well am I in the runway extending business am I in the business of taking something that is good but not great and just continually taking money over and over over time and so I think at that point you kind of have that realization and the board is sitting around they're like oh we can take we can raise money we can borrow money and you're just like well what happens if like we did some cool [ __ ] it just wasn't cool enough and so yeah we're kind of I just said like maybe this is just kind of the end and we're just going to make some more games and see what happens and maybe we're going to go out of business and a couple million people will be sad but you know not not a 100 million uh and so that's kind of what we did and in that that process I I I just thought like let's make one or two more games and we had this one very big game that everybody in the company that was was working on a more kind of complicated uh game and so I said I'd like to at least try to make the last game that we make even though I'm not a game designer I think I've I've worked here and I've kind of like internalized it and I I think that the cool as a sidebar one of the cool things about working in the gaming space is it it Chang your mindset so that you're kind of one game always you're always one game away from something changing the trajectory of the company and if you're in a website or an app or a product business that's dangerous because you always believe like oh my God I'm just one feature away if I just enable push notos if I just add this other thing then my app is going to be gigantic and that can be an illusion which is which is challenging but in a portfolio Theory kind of a games Company is almost like a portfolio of a bunch of smaller startups in some ways and and even if you look at overtime you know we have basketball we have football we have a meeting Media company and they all kind of roll up to some big Vision but they're also a portfolio of different types of bets in some way and so I think that definitely impacted my thinking but I was just thinking okay like we're gonna make one or two more games let's see what happens how how much time did you have four months five months left damn and did you believe or where was the belief because you know start startups are roller coaster you you have the initial surge where this is going to be awesome you have this the the trough of Despair the trough of sorrow where you're it feels like nothing's working and then sounds like you at the end where was the morale at the time I didn't get up on a Podium and say hey y'all we're going to be out of business in five months so polish up that resume uh and we had millions of users I mean our average time on site was like four and a half hours and people loved us it's just that the scale at which they loved us was not the scale at which was happening when Facebook transformed the gaming business and of course like all the money is focused on you and then they're like oh [ __ ] bright shiny object Zinga Farmville anything that ends in Ville and they all ran over there and you're like hey what's up got a couple million users and they're like cool cool all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different compan and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show and so we're like wow we made these web-based games but it's about social games and it's about you know mobile games and so you know you have four to six months left and at some point I think you hit this point where you're just like maybe it is just going to go out of business like you know whatever they say in Wall Street don't fight the tape and like all we're going to do is do our best like we're not going to mortgage the house and do all these other things like that to stay in the b in business for the sake of staying in business and you know we got a we got a couple shots so we have this big game everyone's working on and I think I'm just like I'd like to make a game and maybe I can make a game and maybe I'm like super arogant or really diluted or completely out of touch but like we have this kind of fun drawing and guessing game that we've been making on the internet and like maybe we could make it as a social game off in the corner so everybody in this 50 ing company is making a game and I'm in the corner with like an outsourced Dev and two people on my team and I don't know a ton about making games but the G the game seems fun and I just have this Instinct that like wow the phone is a Communications device and yet every game that's popular on the phone is basically a single player game and so we're back in this like okay everybody is a Game Boy but they're actually connected in some way so could we we do something social and so I start trying to make like a version of this game which was called drama I thing at that time which I think might have been a little intentionally racy and basically like every Friday we would make a version of it and I would try to play it and I'm really dumb and I'm not good at games uh and I can't read instructions and I have a lot of limitations in that space obviously I clearly can't even hoop really um and so I just play the game and I just be like how can this game be simpler I don't really understand it and I'd recognize every Friday when I played it on the subway home like wow this is really fun and I get it and and this isn't and so we kind of get to that point we rename it draw something and we're like kind of last gasp of the com company uh and we try to promote it to our audience you know to our couple of million people we have hey we got this new game it's based on this other thing and it's it's in my mind it is kind of this Hail Mary but you can't run company and go like hey guys we're going to be out of business in four months and by the way this is our Hail Mary or else literally everybody in the entire company would have a psychic breakdown so they're working on this other game with fighting and all this other stuff and we kind of like release this game and we give a lot of promotions so everybody knows about it and the game kind of like climbs the chart right because on day one like 30 or 40,000 people Mo download it because we've given them free coins on our website to do that and it blips up a little bit and it blips up a little bit more and then it kind of crashes down and you're just like okay so what have we learned Dan Porter definitely not as smart as he thought he was probably not a real game designer and looks like it's not going to save the company uh and that's the nature and we try some other promotion and before the weekend like a week out one of the backend developers comes to me and he says I think there's something broken in the game because like there all these calls being made in the game and like they're not going through and he's like I think Chris and I his name was Jason are going to say all weekend we're going to try to fix the back end of the game uh and I'm like cool like what's the downside of that so they stay and they rewrite the entire back end of the game over the weekend but then we have to submit it to the App Store and at that time you submit it to the App Store and it might take a week or two for it to get approved and so I call a famous investor who uh everybody knows who had written a seed check in us and wrote a lot a lot of seed checks and I said listen I just need this one favor like if they could actually review the game and put it up in a day or two it might be huge for us and he says I I can help you but a you never get to ask me another favor B one day in 12 years when you're on Sam and Sean's podcast you can't use my name so that other people don't ask me so blank blank I'm not using your name uh and I'll see what I could do he does it it goes in the App Store uh he he uses his cloud and all of a sudden it's updated and what had been happening was that the game was actually spreading like wildfire but nobody could download it and they couldn't play it once they had downloaded or they downloaded it didn't work so they fix it whatever and the thing just effing just like blows up it just like goes through the roof and all of a sudden it's the number one game in Sweden and the colors were blue and yellow so people were like oh they must be confused about the Swedish flag I was like I think they're a smart peoples maybe they just like the game um and it it it started getting really big there and then weirdly it's started getting really big in small liberal arts colleges um and in Minnesota and all these other places I think what happened was that we were really successful at two things making a game that was really simple to understand and play and ultimately like Grandma's played like it was super Broad and the second thing was making a game that really had just insanely powerful word of mouth but Word of Mouth Works in a very small Titanic community so it works in a liberal arts college of 5,000 people it works in a country like Sweden you know at a giant University or somewhere else it doesn't and so it just starts to grow and well what's the time frame of this I would say literally day by day like in the first nine days we got to a million downloads and then in the first 5050 days we got to 50 million downloads the only app that was in front of us was [ __ ] flashlight cuz at that time the iPhone didn't have a flashlight and somebody make a mid and every dck came in I was like [ __ ] kill flashlight we gotta be more popular than the flashlight is and this is like uh in 10 2010 or something is 2012 12 yeah of course I played it I mean everyone played that game right I mean how many users did you end up having so it it just blows up it just becomes the number one game in like every country in the world for 6 months straight so I would say on a DA basis we had at least 25 million people playing every day uh which was gigantic at that time we ultimately were downloaded 250 million times uh and all of a sudden it was just everywhere and then everyone came to me and they're like we need influencers to make this big and someone's like I know Cristiano Ronaldo's manager and I was like that's really [ __ ] random but like I'll do whatever and then a week later they come in and they're like Miley Cyrus is tweeting about it and like all these celebrities are tweeting about it it has nothing to do with me it's like if you make something that's popular in culture like everybody does it and I remember I I end up making a game show with uh with Ryan CEST and I was like how did you find out about this game he's like all the all the people who sat in the front of the studio like secretaries and the assistants and the Bookers they were just playing it all day and they were laughing their ass off and I keep coming over and I was like what are you guys laughing at and they're like this game and so in this weird way especially in this influencer world like there's this level of traction that you get where people just participate in it because it's part of culture you were like the Haka girl before uh before she was around congratulations I just imaged to stay around for six months as opposed to like three days on Twitter um but you could tell by watching on Twitter I I actually think that we were one of the first games that ever kind of broke on Instagram because it was so visual if you Google draw something and look at Google Images there's billions and billions of of images around it and there were all these funny things about it number one like we didn't put any sharing capability in it so there was just no way to share and that was like the anti antithesis of what everyone did and so what happened was people just took screenshots of their drawings and they just texted and post posted and in this weird way because you didn't ask celebrities to talk about it they talked about it because you didn't ask people to share they shared it and I remember at some point like I was walking through zinga's headquarters and they eventually bought bought the game and there were a bunch of developers and they were trying to figure out the game and trying to like map it so they could copy it and one of them said to me why didn't you put XP in this game I mean every good game has XP and I thought oh [ __ ] you're right I meant to do that but I hadn't done it and so it was it ended up just being this kind of organic game that we knew a lot about but that was built by kind of a regular person and then just played by Regular People and I'll tell you one kind of like geeky game thing about it is that I understood from our site that if you came onto our site and you played a game if you and Sam played and Sam won 50% of the time you would never come back to the site again so let's say it was even Checkers the first time you lose Checkers you're like F this site this isn't fun and you lose so what does that say to you about running a gaming site where literally somebody's going to lose and then you're going to lose them as as basically as a customer and so in my head I was like I need to figure out this way that you could have a game where nobody loses and that's like some like that's like one of those riddles like which is the door you knock on to get into heaven or hell or other things like that what is a game that has no winners and losers and so one day I was in Prospect Park uh with my son my younger son miles and his friend and they were throwing the football and I was like listen if you guys can throw and catch it 50 times in a row I'll take you for ice cream because basically I'm just trying to get them to collaborate and they were like oh it's like a streak we're going to keep doing it and I was like oh my God there's no winner and loser like they're both winners in this game uh and so I'm just like oh you're going to have streaks and draw something like the more you can go back and forth and everybody's a winner and all this other stuff so it's fun for everyone involved so there are all these kind of non-game moments in life and and subsequently somebody at snap told me oh yeah we took that idea of streaks from what you guys had done in that game and it's not like I was like in some lab cooking up amazing like ideas about internet and the future of gaming it was just kind of like I was just this regular person observing trying to answer some of these existential question questions and looking around me and I wasn't a gamer so I didn't really use XP and I was like looking for the ways that what made people laugh and what made them smile and the biggest thing is listen if the first game was called Draw my thing what do you think people draw in the game like this is not hard well well that's something uh you and Sean actually have that in common you have both owned uh social apps where uh drawing penises were was one of the main features and I remember this like very long board meeting they were like you know we're going to use optical character recognition and we're going to recognize every dick in the game and then we're going to blank it out and this other board member is like it doesn't matter whether it goes to the left or the right we're going to figure it out and we're gonna just get it out and I just thought like wow that was really hard and it's like her lies Dan Porter he he figured on his grave he figured out how to use like early artificial intelligence to spot you know di KS and games and stuff like that and so ultimately I just made this change where it's like you could only play with your friends because I just figured like okay so like whatever you send your friend something like that they either laugh or they're like dude come on just send me a real drawing and it's just kind of like one of these moments where it's like you're trying to solve this problem and the reality is is the solution for the problem is actually something that's like bigger in a way like that like I I'll tell you a really dumb story I had like terrible knee pain and it's like at some point I was climbing stairs and I started wearing like pads on my knees and I finally went to the doctor I went to like an NFL doctor and I'm thinking he's gonna tell me I need knee surgery he does all these things to me and he says listen lie on the table it's like I'm going to touch your heels to your butt and I'm like ah it really hurts he's like yeah your quads are so freaking tight it's you have nothing to do with your knee what you think is the problem is completely not the problem you just need to stretch out your quads and I was like oh my God I just a of avoided knee surgery and be learned one of the greater lessons in life which is you think it's this input output but there are all of these things that are around it it's like not about recognizing you know the dicks in your game it's about changing some other structure around you uh it's about figure out to stretch out your quads I think we found your uh your biography title it's not about it's not about the game exactly hey were you I I know you had a business before this but were you financially successful uh before starting this company or was it like this has to work otherwise I'm broke and I got to start over I was kind of like us I wasn't like in I mean my parents were College professors so I didn't have a ton of money I had been a public school teacher and worked in nonprofit education before this so I didn't really have a massively lucrative career I was average I mean I couldn't stop working but you know I didn't have to eat ramen every day but yeah this this game and this company was the chance to completely change the trajectory of my life and my family's life from a financial perspective without a doubt I think the the insight about uh you know people why do people stop playing my game you sort of invert instead how I make everyone play by game it's why would somebody not play a game well because they lose and they feel bad and so you're like can you make a game where people don't lose and feel bad and the beautiful thing about the streak is let's say we lost well we're playing together we're collaborating I almost feel like I owe you so instead of out because I lost I'm like no I got to make up for that my bad I dropped the ball let's start the streak again and and I I definitely have to play because I'm the one who cost us the streak that was the first thing I also loved I mean this game was amazing dude this was like my flirt game you're you were basically my wingman I didn't even know you at the time I got a girlfriend through draw something because it was such a simple game you download it and immediately it's like draw this the beauty of it was it would show the other person like almost like a a playback of you drawing it for those who didn't play this game it's like I don't remember the exact mechanics it's like you have to draw it'll tell you what to draw you start to draw it the other person doesn't know what you had to draw they have to guess and it would show you like kind of start stopping erasing and it was really funny to see people's kind of like mistakes as they were drawing the thing and you could only be so good like nobody could really be that great unless you're really really talented because it's a finger on a little iPhone screen so the expectations were low too and I just thought I remember the first time I saw that oh it lets you watch the other person draw the thing and that makes you laugh and then that makes you feel connected with this person because it's like almost like both sides are like a little vulnerable in a way right you're embarrassing yourself it's like playing charades um it makes you like each other more and I remember thinking this is genius and this game is so simple there's been so many people come on this podcast to say the same thing it's like well my back was against the wall like we didn't really have another choice I wasn't an expert at this thing but I just wanted to make a game that that would be really fun to play and every week we would make it and every Friday I would play test it and then I just try to figure out what I could do to make it a little bit better than it was just that Friday I'll try to make one tweak and I just did that one tweak at a time and sure enough that actually resulted in a great product it's not this like highly complex convoluted Grand Theory approach to making things successful no totally I mean people used to say to me I'm not I love that game but I'm not really that good at drawing and I was like that's the kind of the point of the game like there were people who had pens and iPads who could draw great things but it should be accessible to everyone weirdly we release a game and within a week there were five games that were released that were similar but we were the only game that had the playback and you know how people always say like the greatest thing about the iPhone is is when they text you that code and it lets you hit that little thing and it puts the code in anything you're filling out like it's just like sometimes there's some aspect of the product that doesn't scene like the core aspect but it's so great and to your point it wasn't just the drawing it was the erasing it made you feel like there was a live person on the other side of it and that that really was the point of it and then there were a lot of other just like really totally random goofy things like I don't think I've ever said this before but like in the beginning there'd be a little screen and these letters would make a word and the word it made was Manu m a n c h u l man AKA CH was one of our developers and we just punked him and just put his name in the beginning of the thing and nobody ever said anything and after Zinga bought it for like two years they left it up there and you'd open it and it wouldn't say like draw something or whatever it would just say Manel was like this just like just put these weird things in there just because because you can and because listen you could say from a strategy look if I'm not having fun how can I make sure that the people who are doing the drawings are having fun and you sold it for you sold it for like what $200 million to zingga yes and that was when Zinga was at its peak that was like five to six weeks after the game really kind of came out and burst like we sold it it happened so fast no way six weeks yeah so that was like the crazy turnaround so they hired two law firms one worked the first 12 hours of the day on the deal and then the other one worked the second 12 hours of the day of the deal and the whole deal got done in nine days and I'm like how like all this paperwork I'm trying to run around and figure out how did it happen so the game's blowing up and what you get an email from Mark pinkis or how did that the game is blowing up and not only is it so big it's literally sucking the user base out of every single other game on the market and so that zingga that's EA that's like everybody else who's about to report earnings and talk about their da and Ma and you know I have these videos of the download numbers and the counter is just broken because there's you know you there's a million drawings happening every 5 seconds and so you know Mark knew somebody on my board they invited me to the headquarters I was a joker So I entered my name as Dr Dre from the company NWA coming in I thought maybe somebody would know I was there or whatever uh ultimately there were five or six companies that were really interested in buying it because it was just the trajectory was so big and I think they were playing offense like they clearly was like these guys are some mobile games saans and I think they were playing defense because they were bleeding all of their users across everywhere and the deal closed 6 weeks after the after draw something went live that's got to be one of the fastest that's got to be one of the fastest close like launch to close times ever it was insanely fast and the funny thing is that I went to GDC which is a game developer conference and the year before I went and like nobody knew who I was and it just so happened that it happened at the peak moment of the game I went and like everybody knew who I was but then I could meet with like seriously like every buyer like in two days because everybody was in San Francisco for that conference and we also got a turn sheet for $50 million which I had folded up and put in my pocket and went to a event and I dropped it and I couldn't find it and I only had the print out so I had a rough idea of what the terms were but it was on the floor of some party somewhere and I came back and I asked kind of like the ogs who had been there for four or five years since they're only seven of us and we were working above like a combination Taco Bell Dunkin Donuts where the smell was different on which side of the room you were on and I was like do you guys want to raise money and like build something really big or do you want to sell the company and they were like sell the company um and I get it they had put five years of their life they were at a pivotal time in their life and it was lifechanging for them um so I think that was a decision and and I think people ask me a lot of times also listen we were really really good at making games and we made a really popular game and we were good at the community management and the social media around it but you take $50 million and you spend a lot of that on building a legal team building a sales team building all these commodity things that I didn't think we were necessarily going to be better than anyone else at so we just wanted to be in a place where we could make games H how did you negotiate the price they the buyers came back and they were like 120 $150 million the board was ecstatic well where did they come up with that number um I think they were looking at probably we were making a ton of money because uh we had so many screens in the game when you go back and forth and back and forth so we're trading ad advertising Revenue you're looking at you know roughly kind of how much is an MA or a Dau interesting to you and so we bring it to the board and the board is ecstatic because we go from being like Oh should we essentially wind this thing down to now we have this thing that's popular and somebody wants to buy it and so they're like great like $120 million I was like this thing is worth $250 million because like anyone I'm extremely high on my own Supply at that time and you know there's this moment where basically the message they're saying to me is like you're the CEO but it's not your company it's our company like you don't control this thing and there's kind of a subtle message from me to them being like well fine [ __ ] sell this thing without me because this thing is worth so much money and that's 50% complete delusion and arrogance and adrenaline and all the other things that happen uh you know when you're in the desert and you have a couple million users and now you have hundreds of millions of users and part of me thinking like may maybe I actually am right and like maybe it is worth more and so they give me this small window and I go back Bluster draw something's the greatest thing somebody tweets like you know y combinator pitch to draw something of X and you know that that matters to all those people and so I go back and I'm like I need this and I need that and I need this and you know it's a it's a gamble but it was right like we got way more money and a way better deal because a segment of the buyers really really needed it because they were you know they were telling results the hit to their stock was bad you know somebody like uh EA was invested in sports games somebody like a zingo was over invested in Farmville you know you have strategic imperative to people so sure you're super valuable but they're all playing a much bigger game and if you can understand that that's where your Leverage is and then boom all of a sudden we do that I come back I'm like the company's sold and it's you know this this whole crazy kind of episode and the funniest thing to me is like I start reading all of these things like why Draw Something succeeded and then these other articles why Draw Something failed and you know when you're an entrepreneur you read a ton of these and you come back and you're like did you see these you tell your team you see this article we need to be doing this and the reality was is that every single article was wrong like it was completely wrong like their analysis was wrong like there was this whole thing about why we failed but they were analyzing our iPad app and we didn't have an iPad app we just had a stretched out mobile app for iPad and then all of a sudden you just realize oh [ __ ] I've been reading these articles as an entrepreneur about why things succeed and failure I've been making decisions and they were probably wrong there and now when it's happening to me they're really [ __ ] wrong but it was this like crazy ride then all of a sudden you know we're part of Zinga and then all of a sudden a year later I'm not working there so it was an amazing rise and fall totally turned around the company saved us and we did a whole bunch of things you know there were a bunch of employees who I had to let go and I just made the decision on my own to rehire them like the day before the deal closed that their options would still vest there were people who had taken more cash than stock because they had little kids and I got a cash component that I could use at my discretion and so I just gave them the money that they would have made this just this chance to do like all this insanely non- capital but like super cool [ __ ] to change people's lives and after the deal closed they had a debt-free club where all the employees who had college loans all paid off their college loans and there's a moment when you have a little bit of money left in your bank account and that's going to go to the other company so I ran to the Apple Store in SoHo they used to love me and I bought a $100,000 worth of iPads and all this stuff and I just gave it out to everybody who worked at the company and every now and then somebody will text me they're like I still have that iPad for 2012 and so all of a sudden you just do kind of all the cool fun [ __ ] that they would never teach you to do in business school they teach you to do the opposite but you can do it because you have this superpower which is not only does somebody want your company but you have this ability to impact the lives of all these people who've given you their all for the last five years and to me that was the coolest part of it Sam you know one of the things I love about Dan is we meet a lot of Founders and entrepreneurs and almost all of them I would actually say 80 90% of them will say it's it's not about money money is not the biggest thing for me I would say most people want that to be true and then you go look at their actions and it's like those people are the most transactional they're the people that want the money the most and they they want to not want the money but they want the money and I I'm guilty of that too Dan is one of the few people I met I believe it who plays a game with money it's not that money doesn't matter to you but he's told me a bunch of stories of it wasn't about the money like he made a decision that was actively not money driven or not even like logical but he just does it for the fun and for the kicks it's like the Joker in Batman right like most people want to be Batman Dan I feel like you want to be Joker where you're just like I just want to see what happens if I do this what if I tie up this this person you love over here and this L who are you gonna go get I can't wait to find out have you read his LinkedIn so his LinkedIn is pretty hilarious so it's it starts with I think you were the president of Teach for America when I when I think of Teach for America I think of like kind of hippie-ish like do good for the World type of vibe then you go to gaming which is in my opinion the gamers are typically like the hardest core capitalist there are it's just like you're practically working on an Excel sheet on how to change things but then so you got this like weird hippie side but then you're also this capitalist but then his late didan so after uh uh selling draw something he goes to work for Ari Emanuel at Endeavor who Sean and I love we love reading about Ari listen what he says he goes I told Ari to pass on five companies for investing that he ignored me and he invested in them anyway all of them are now out of business know what you know my guy he's got this like shitthead vibe that I love that I love and that he's also like does good stuff for America and is also this like greedy capitalist he's the perfect combination of like of being a holistic balanced human being I love it I I I appreciate those nice words I I will say I understand what it's like to you know be average or not have no money but not have any spectacular upside and also I would say like there's two things that really motivated me one was somebody who once said to me he was kind of Oprah's manager and helped her be really big and when I was in my 20s he once said to me the most powerful people are the people who know how to give up power and not a lot of people say things to me that I either remember or have an impact but I just always was like like wow that's so interesting it is like it's not hard to be powerful and consolidate power it's way harder to be powerful and somehow let go of power and I think there's some aspect you could substitute money or anything else like that sure like Zinga said here's $5 million in cash I could have put that whole thing in my own bank account if I wanted to and sure I W do I wish I had that money today sure who doesn't but like to be able to release that and give it to other people and change their lives it's just it's just [ __ ] cool and then I would say to me like and I told this to Safford the whole time the number one thing that motivated me was every day I rode the subway and every day people played games on their iPhone and I was just like I want to make a game that people play on their Ione and I remember there was a point at which the game was so big it was like everybody I knew was playing it it was everywhere and I was walking my dog with one of my kids in um Prospect Park and there was like this couple and they were like canoodling on a bench and they were laughing I'm thinking oh my God I wonder if they're playing Draw Something I got to go check it out so I kind of like walk behind the bench and I look over and and they're playing it and I think in that moment I'm like cool but I of course I can't help myself I tap them on the shoulder and I'm like I made that game and they were like looked at me like I was like a stalker and they were like oh oh cool and then they went back to doing what they were doing but to me it's the same thing it's like I walk through an airport and I see some kid wearing an over time shirt and I just think like that's [ __ ] cool like I made that everyone who I work with we made that and like the fact that you can make something that's out in the world that people love they don't even know you have anything to do with I did a a whole Music Festival when I was at virgin and I remember standing on stage next to Richard Branson and like Roger dotry and the who were screaming and like dads have their kids on their shoulder there's like 880,000 people there and I'm thinking like I was a spark that like made this happen and I'm not interested in these people ever knowing who I am like that's not the point the point is you made something and it existed in the world and it touched people who have no idea who you are and I just can't tell you how [ __ ] existentially cool that is can I ask you a little bit about uh Branson and Ari so yeah Sean and I have been on this Ari Emanuel kick because he's not probably like us at all in that he's significantly more intense go go go take over the world Sean and I care a little bit more about just having an uh our ideal lifestyle but then you've got Branson so youal you said the guy was like it's more about who can release power so Branson seems like a guy where it's like decentralized Ari's like a guy where it's like he's the he's the boss and it's a little bit more dictatorship this is just an Outsiders observation but what can you say about the difference between the two of them and what attributes each person had that made him kick ass yeah so let me say like Ari is an amazing guy and I learn a ton working for him and Richard is also an amazing guy I would say in Ari's case when I worked at WME before they bought IMG before they bought UFC three months into it people were like what is it like to work there and I was like it's the greatest [ __ ] Jewish family dinner you've ever been you just sit around the table and everybody's screaming at each other at the top of their lungs but they actually love each other and I had just never worked in an environment like like that like are you going walk into somebody's office he said listen you [ __ ] schmuck you know what about this and that and they're like that's not true and I'm like wait they're yelling at each other but they love each other it was actually wild and I think that AR's an example of somebody in a number of ways one is he's relentlessly curious like he reads he consumes information there's nothing he doesn't want to learn about and I think that that is this incredible spark for him in within the company to clearly Like Richard but in a different way he has an incredible amount of personal Charisma but he uses his personality to his advantage and in a way the person he actually reminded me the most of who I worked with later was actually David Stern the former MBA commissioner because like I'd be in a room with David and we'd be talking about basketball and he'd look at me and say listen Dan I get it you're good at raising money but are you [ __ ] good at anything else because clearly it doesn't seem like you are and so it's almost like this Catskill comedian style of using humor and your personality that's probably rooted in some like Jewish humor and whatever that says to you hey like maybe you should turn left instead of going straight here but I'm GNA say it in a way that that is funny but but you you get what I'm saying and and that's going to make you love me in the end too and I think that Ari is very very funny and was very good at that by strength of personality and also like he could he could call you every single day that that's how he recruited you right what was what's the story of how he recruited you when he wanted me to work there he just decided he wanted me to work there and he called me every single day for four months and what did he say he would just be like you know we have all this IP we need to do this we should come here and then I'd go to talk and I'd realize he wasn't there anymore and that's the problem with cell phones is wait did he did did he did he hang up without saying bye yeah that's awesome that's what the agents do they roll calls you a list of 300 people hey hey how you doing Larry David good but whatever and then he's on to the next one and they understood it and I was an idiot I just wasn't from that environment so I didn't really understand it so I'd be talking and I'd look and i' just see the time on my phone because he'd have hung up and he'd on to the next call um and I just think there's this incredible personal force and momentum that he has and sometimes I think for some people people they have that but it can lead to a really toxic work environment and there are all kinds of exposures I think he loves life he enjoys everything he's very funny and I think he he could have both of those in a way and he was good at understanding what made you tick and connecting with that I think Richard is really different Richard is very laidback but very cool and I remember going to this meeting at Virgin Mobile in Canada and he wanted to talk to all the people in the phone room the customer support people and people just don't do that and he basically just tells him this story about when he lost his virginity like no pun intended and it's this very funny story where he humanizes himself and he's just this regular guy and he's not talking to the Sea Suite he's talking to all people answer the phone and they just leave that thing and they think [ __ ] love Richard Branson he is like the man and it's just a it's just Charisma it's just different for each of them and it's very rooted in what their brand is their brand is extremely clear and articulated but it's clearly they've understood how to make who they are they're not trying to be anyone they aren't but they've they've rooted that and I think in this world where people become very studied and they read articles and they hire coaches and they do all these other things like that both Richard and Ari had the superpower in that they just knew exactly who they were and they captain in who that was and and that was their brand and maybe you make some comment about my LinkedIn it's not like I wake up in the day and I think I just want to [ __ ] troll everyone who reads my LinkedIn I just think like maybe this would be actually funny and so I think there's some self-realization and it helps to be charismatic and that's really hard to learn and and otherwise but I think in a way they both tap into it and they both are Relentless but not in this grinds set way in this way that like everybody reads on Reddit about how they're supposed to go and grind and grind and be relentless they just have the zest to do something that matters and something that's bigger and where does that come from that's for the psychiatrist couch but again it's it's authentic and it's Unique to them it's not studied and I think that's part of that what makes it so powerful the internet Community or industry whatever you want to call it we need more of that my father is a a small business owner and he does all of his business via phone and I used to to sit in his office and he'd be like I remember he just like would call someone be like hey sweetheart uh look what's money amongst friends right it's just money we got to make some we got to make something work here like just like this like charm sweet talk I remember hearing this or just just like little things like look it's a little early for you to be busting my balls this morning we go let's make something you know just like this like gift to gab yeah we don't have that in our industry it's significantly more formal it's like calls are scheduled every call is like the default calendar length of the Google Calendar which is 30 minutes like it's just different and I I actually love that that type of stuff it's the in between stuff that makes those things happen look Ari was an agent maybe like the most super super agent of all time and he he definitely understood that David understood that he was not a basketball player he didn't play basketball in college commissioner Stern and he came into a thing and he's dealing with basketball players and coaches and China and international and it's just you know there's there's like a a human connection there's humor there's Charisma there's all those things that kind of fit into it and and and I I remember you know a thing that someone else said to me at some point this guy Dick Parsons who had run a big bank and it was some point was the chairman of Time Warner and very very influential and he said listen whenever I do a deal with somebody I always just leave a little bit extra on the table cuz you never know when you're going to come back I want to do another deal with them and like you know the internet is filled with here's how do you extract maximum value from the other person here's how you [ __ ] win in negotiation and the reality is it's like maybe there is enough to go around and maybe I'm going to let you have a little wins because I care about our relationship and maybe we're going to do business in the future and and everything else like that so I I think you know per your dad's story and otherwise that they're there is a bunch of that and and sometimes it makes it easier you know they just sent me this thing they're like what do you think about all these things we're proposing and I just wrote back and I was like these are seriously mid and that's like in front of 15 people so we have this meeting and the guy says to me listen my only goal in this meeting is how can we not be so mid so I'm like okay you get my point and yet I have a cross some crazy HR line and you've given it back to me and so that what is a goal a goal is to actually make something that slightly better but it requires you know trust and humor and may maybe there's a lost start in in in cat skills humor and business and maybe maybe that's going to be my next company after this how old are you I'm 58 years old so you started over time when you were what 50 years old and your partner did I read your partner was 24 yeah when we started Zach was 22 that's that's some Leo Nardo DiCaprio [ __ ] I like it so you I would only doubt dat Fender's under 25 so you by the way the hilarious thing is I saw overtime and I was like man this brand is awesome Sam I don't think you're as into kind of like the uh Hoops mixtape culture of Sam's not about the culture you know like you are so exactly I've been waiting for somebody to call Sam out look more than you know more than you know come on it's all good so we see overtime and overtime just takes off amongst basically like the young black market in America it's the coolest brand it's the shirt everybody's wearing it's the Instagram page people are following I'm looking for the founder of this thing I remember when I first saw it I'm looking for the founder and I have an image in my head of what I think the founder of overtime looks like what what was the image in your head some guy maybe 28 years old he's gotta have some business savvy to him but I figured it was like a 28-year old black guy who used to play basketball or still playing basketball maybe comes from the music scene as some sort of Music promoter or record label exact because there was definitely like a culture crossover aspect to this where it was not just Prospect rankings or [ __ ] like that like not just like a database of athletes or it was not done that way and then I see it's Dan Porter and I meet Dan and Dan actually really helped us out with milk Road Sam I don't know if ever told you told you this but no I didn't know that he was like I don't know how we got connected he was reading the milk Road early on we asked him yo big fan of what you did can we just get on the phone for an hour and Dan's like you got to do this and he's like this is working and I think the instinct when something is working is to kind of button it up and grow up and he's like no no no you're that's exactly the thing that's great about this is that it's not as buttoned up because there I think there was a big Bitcoin conference going on he's like you should host the anti-confederate brand working for Richard you know and he really understood the idea of Challenger brand and I think for me I was really interested in community especially coming from gaming and I was like what is the challenge around being in the media space and you know being tangential the digital media space I'm like it's all content and Views and it's like you're looking on your phone or somewhere else and it's like that's funny but it could come from anywhere and so I was like you know maybe what the audience wants is a sense of community a sense of being part of something you know belonging to something I think that was a clearly a growth hack for religion thousands of years ago like let's get a place where people can get together and make them feel part of something and I think people wanted that and so to me it's a it's just like you start from that standpoint and you just start to observe the world around you so you go you know you go to a British soccer game and you realize like they're singing like Sweet Caroline and you're like what does Neil Diamond have to do with soccer I never understood that and it's just it's such a good singalong song and then all of a sudden you're just like where else can grown men I guess aside from church go someplace and sing in the top of their lungs and like why are people fandom and why do they pink their faces and I I remember I went to a like a little baby birthday concert at State Farm and everyone was holding up their phone and I was trying to make a video to put on my story to show that I was valid and all of a sudden I realized they were all filming themselves I was like one of the only people actually filming the concert like they were all content creators they went to a concert as a platform for them to make content about themselves and I was like I'm not that way but like to me it was so fascinating there's some anthropological understanding of about you know you ask people which way you point your camera and a certain age you're you're you know you're filming other people and a certain age you're filming themselves and I just think I've had this Relentless curiosity about that and to me you can Google brand and you can read a lot of [ __ ] that has a high ranking in you know in Google about how to do this and that but the passion of the soccer team or the passion that you feel for a sports team you think about things like the grateful dead that just gave away their music and let people record it when all it would happen when I was a kid is you'd go to a concert and they'd Frisk you to make sure you don't have a recording device on you and how they understood like well [ __ ] I could let my fans be the distribution and it could grow 10x bigger than anything else like that and then all of a sudden it's not about your song it's like well I have that song you know this show at Nassau Coliseum and I have this show at Hampton and I have this song this version of that and so I think in a way like all of those examples exists out there and I remember I watched the Travis Scott documentary that's on Netflix and it's so interesting to me that his audience is so much more passionate about him they literally cry when they're coming out of the show and he dives into the stage and you just ask there are a hundred rappers out there why is Travis Scott over here and there all the way over there like why do people literally go do people go to a lil ly vert show and cry I don't know maybe they do but I don't think in the same way well what's that answer I I spend hours of brain powered trying to figure out what that is in reverse engineer it because like why is this person or this brand so much more beloved and the other why is Ari so much more effective in his business than other people are I think for Travis Scott it's something about the music but it is something about the fact that he cares so much more about his fans that he is literally able to jump in the middle and be there with him and then when you magnify that the symbolism around that the storytelling I think even for me it's listen I you know sure I'm a guy who is not the same as the people who put on my account but I'm willing to get in there and answer DMS and talk to them and connect them without music and ask them a hundred questions I have this like you know they always have this thing they say if you could give respect you can get respect I don't walk into a room and think that anyone will ever respect me or care about me based on who I am unless I am the first one to give respect and I know that every single person in that room whether they're a 16-year-old Hooper or a talent agent or a YouTuber has something incredibly deserving of respect and my job is to figure out what that is and honor that and learn about that so overtimes Instagram has like I don't know 11 million followers probably I don't know billions of views over the years and it's one thing to say you know I learned a lot from Branson or I've watched how other brands work and I've noticed these two or three things it's like me watching Jiu-Jitsu versus going in there and rolling with you know hoist Gracie you've gone there and you've you've rolled with the Gracies which which means you actually then went and did it with overtime can you talk about a couple of the things that you did intentionally that you think helped build the cult more of a cult Brands so you know for example the hand symbol yeah tell me what's the hand signal and every great gang in the world has a has a hand sign you know and so like we need a hand sign and I was like oh OT and they were like simplify it make the O throw up the O which is hilarious just imagine your CEO sitting in an office and he's just throwing up symbols he's like I'm really working on something today guys it's gonna be big okay what do you guys think do you think the O should be oval or more circular and it sounds silly but I think you even you told your people you're like if you go to this event and you record every video you got to get them at the end to be like put up the O and say shout out to overtime the same thing because I remember S I saw once forgettable saw it twice forgettable once you see it like 25 times and you got the like cool high school athletes to do it it was like now it's a thing I've had people do it to me at TSA actually when they see my shirt and stuff like that I think it comes back to just if you want there to be community and you care about community and that was a premise you have to give Community a way to interact and to share what makes that special with them right so I'm a Philadelphia Eagles fan I live in New York which is clearly not Philadelphia I'm walking down the street and I see somebody in Eagles baseball hat I say go birds and they're like go Birds you've given us this common language to say I don't know who you are we might have nothing in common but we got one thing for sure in common and so being maybe nerdy or cerebral on that thing I'm like what are those things that are going to give our community they're not just going to be like hey my good fellow I enjoy the content on overtime and he says thus I do too do you prefer Tik Tok or SnapChat or Instagram and so instead you give them this little shout out to Overtime or this hand sign as a way to say yeah we're part of this community you know this kind of if you know you know not unlike the secret right it's like somebody it's like my father-in-law is always like I'm going to tell you the secret handshake for our fraternity but he never gives you the secret handshake he just like tickles your finger or something like that a sorry I can't really tell you like you're 100 years old who cares about this secret handshake oh we're sword to secrecy right you know and so you have these things the secret handshake knock on the door what's the password you know I can't tell you I can't let you in you know and I think you create you understand in consuming culture and even pop culture that there are these things that bind people together and sometimes you got to Strongarm them into existence using the superpower of social media as a customer relations platform like a CRM as opposed to a publisher every single DM to overtime and even to me starts out the same yo I don't know why but that is apparently a very popular thing for people to DM large accounts yo and you you go back and they're like yo and the next thing is oh [ __ ] I didn't think overtime responded I mean I was talking to this 21y old kid who works for me and we were talking about going and doing something he's like listen you don't understand like I was like 15 I DMD overtime I just was like yo and they DMD me back and I'm thinking not they you work here we but he's saying they and so I think just figuring out how to connect with people how to use those superpowers what are the things that around religion around cults songs there hand signs there's things that you wear you know part of the reason that I created this like shirt with the O that you know eventually all the talented people work for me made way better and bigger was the people used to steal our content all the time so we'd go and we'd cover somebody and they'd just rip our video and then I'd make a watermark and then they Zoom the video out of the watermark to crop it so I was like you know what if we just made a shirt with our o on it then we have like a permanent watermark in our thing and if they rip our video then that's fine then our o is actually everywhere we've turned our biggest challenge into our biggest opportunity and so all of a sudden there were people with shirts with O's everywhere because people were ripping those videos and you know everyone would say oh [ __ ] how do I get one of those because it must mean you're famous so the biggest thing we did is for two years we we refused to sell it well you can't buy one of those shirts like you have to be on overtime to have that and then eventually you create so much pen up demand and I can't say that was in the deck or the business plan but as you start to get into a dance and a romance with culture you start to observe what's happening and you make some kind of audibles around that and you figure that out but like to be part of culture is to be part of community to be what's relevant to happening around you and you know listen we start a basketball league every single startup Sports league in America has failed pretty much you know and by the way the NBA the NF these are 5075 years old and you can think about all these startup football leagues that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars and it's like why is OT overtime Elite a startup basketball league in its fourth season and every other league has gone out of business well it's because we're focused on the audience we weren't focused on just playing the sport it's like you know what people want they want more football they want more basketball they want more baseball so it's another league and it's like well they just they want to know like why should I care about this why is this league about me who is playing what are the hopes and the dreams of the people were playing there instead it's like well we got a field and we had a bunch of city-based teams and we said here America you like more football but like if you can't appeal to the aspects of culture and community and emotion to them why should they care and and listen me I wasn't a gamer and I made a pretty popular game I I didn't know a lot about ticketing and I started the first live event ticketing company I like sports I'm not a sports wizard I would come in last on a sports quiz show but it's like I am more like the consumer and that I don't want to get sucked in so on so deep so it's like what is resonating oh [ __ ] there's a simple story about that I'll tell you one side thing that made overtime big when we started I was like here's Sean he's like 6'2 he has an eight foot wingspan he plays for George Washington High School he's a point guard he shoots 50% for three and like we put the video up there cuz that's what sports is about stats and all those things every single time I removed one piece of metadata it got bigger down to the fact that it was like Sean is [ __ ] dope boom everyone can love that because as soon as you tell me Sean went to George Washington High School I'm like I don't know where that high school is I don't care anymore you know as soon as you tell me he shoots X from three I'm like is that good or is that bad I don't care anymore so in this weird way similar to the Draw Something game the more you can simplify it the more it's avail able to everyone the more you tell me this wine is from this country with this that and it's docc and it's this grape or whatever I just think like [ __ ] it maybe I'm just going to drink tequila can you do this stuff with nerdy products or B2B products or do you think that it's much harder and only possible for pop culture or consumer products I I think everything has a story at its core I always think of this dumb example from like a business book that I read 30 years ago where you know where they used to like do door to door selling of vacuum cleaners and a guy would go around he would tell the person who answers the door you know the suction is so strong and it's got these things and they sold all the features of the product and he sold 10 vacuum cleaners and then the next guy comes around he knocks on the door and he just [ __ ] sells you the dream of a clean house and every time like you find your own salespeople and they're in how many views we have and this is why our product is so great and I'm always thinking just got to [ __ ] sell them the dream of the clean house and so in a way there is some abstract simplification of the core of what makes everything great and the more you know about it the worse you get and the further away you get at telling that story so it's like we have this basketball league we had the number two pick in last week's NBA draft we had the number eight pick we have four lottery picks in two years X number of people watched it on here you know all these people are playing professionally and at the end of the day like somebody from the NBA is like why do people care about your basketball league I'm like because it's their [ __ ] the NBA that's that's your [ __ ] that's old people's [ __ ] like this is their [ __ ] and I can never forget that I can't get be distracted by the fact that you know Alex went number two and Rob went number eight and now they're on these back contracts and they went to OT and whatever it's like if you can keep that fundamental core aspect of why it matters in mind at all time and not get suck down the vortex I think that that's you know that's the key it's like nearly impossible the bigger you get not to do that stuff Sean and I both love UFC and the reason we like Ari Emanuel is in part because he owns the UFC and what Dana White has done there we love because like when Sean Strickland fights you're like well this guy he's a crazy person who just says wildly offensive stuff and it's really fun because he's in saying or this guy's from Brazil and he's really scary looking and he doesn't even speak English and he wears a red paint painting on his face and it's really intimidating looking they do such a good job of telling a story even though they're a massive company now and they haven't well you know you know what's like I I remember I was a fan at the core of the USC and the core of the UFC was every martial art against each other right this guy's a standup guy this guy's going to take him to the ground this guy's a college wrestler this guy's a judo guy like that is the easiest [ __ ] story to tell in the world you could even look at the NBA finals or the Super Bowl or whatever ultimately we're in these rivalries this City versus that City this boxer versus that boxer but if you could abstract to tell me this is actually a story about passing versus running or this is a story about something else like that then you're just like oh I want to know how that's going to play out like that's so interesting I was trying to tell people I went to the Euro League Championship with all these kind of young people and Greece was was playing turkey in the semi-finals and they're like wow these fans are really passionate and I was like yeah let's talk about the history of two countries Greece and Turkey and it's not clear to them but I'm like yeah there's something so Elemental at the core of the passion I think the MBA finals are amazing I'm not quite sure that Boston and Dallas have existential beef against each other that go back hundreds of years so you've got to find some other core Elemental story in it like these guys bought their team and these guys drafted their team your master he says your karate is better than my Kung Fu if you can stay to that in all those stories and that's clearly a huge aspect of I think what UFC had in the beginning that was so powerful and I think that's part of AR's genius is he does understand at its core like what makes you like Mark Wahlberg when he signs him as an actor what makes these stories kind of simple in a way because as soon as you find yourself to oversell you've lost the cause as soon as you're talking about the third switch on the vacuum cleaner that has seven hepp HEPA a filters you've lost the whole thing that's a great story you're fun as [ __ ] to talk to you got like I I I I could hear stories that you say all day I'm just trying to figure out how all works c d can I ask you like a life advice thing so uh you know if you were my dad so you you did a bunch of things right you you were a teacher in schools then you did Teach for America you worked for these like high-powered organizations like virgin and and uh you know Endeavor with ar manual you started your own company in the gaming space you started your own company in the media space if you if you meet like a 24 yearold you know ambitious person who just wants to have an interesting life want to have a great life they don't even really know exactly what they want what's your approach like what does Dan think you should be doing in your 20s you know what what do you think you should be doing in your 30s how how do you what is like the nutshell of your career advice first of all there's a lot of ways you can learn about the world I learned about the World by being a public school teacher I learned about the World by you know giving guitar lessons like there's so many different ways and I think that so I I have this thing where I I just I really don't like to hire people on to business school and I'm kind of anti- MBA because to me if there's a funnel and it starts when you're like five years old and you ask why is the sky blue why do people walk on two legs that funnel goes through the education system and then it gets to business school and then it Narrows and it closes and they're just like this is the way you do things and then you've lost all that like pie in the sky whatever so I kind of say to young people like your 20s it's like the time for you to get fired from a job the time for you to stay up way too late and go to a club time for you to like take a Euro pass across England a time for you for your friend to say I'm going to do this crazy thing and you're like yes you know the time to just say yes and do all those things and inest and experience as much of the world as possible a because all of those experience come and form you in some way like if I didn't go to the concert or I didn't sing at a soccer show or I didn't do any of these other things like that I don't think I would have ever understood these but also because the world is so big and so vast like if you haven't you know hitchhiked through some other country or stayed in a hammock somewhere or done anything else like that you just have no context and appreciation for that and you you think your job is to graduate and then to get the job and then to be the analyst and then the associate and then the this and then the managing director and now you're on this pipeline but you've youve failed to do all these other things I have a master's degree in 19th century Mexican history that I did while I was working my focus was the cast War of the Yucatan people were like why are you doing that how does that help you in your career and I'm like it doesn't it just seemed interesting and like if you look on my LinkedIn I'll say it never had any impact nobody ever asked me about it I never got ahead by having a a master's degree I don't do business in 19th century Mexico I don't know you just do [ __ ] when you're young because that's the time you do [ __ ] and you just learn about the world and you experience things and you laugh and you cry and you get out there and like if you think it's all about this ladder that you get to this other thing it it really isn't and every single one of those things that you do that has no rationale is really actually about opening a door to something else that's kind of my advice you have to go to your rate your Rate My Professor uh profile your top tag your top tag is inspirational to which I would to which I agree you are you are inspirational gives good feedback just like uh with your co-workers you said eh mid uh you're inspirational you love you love group projects and get ready to read those are your tags for rap my professor that listen I like there is so much from business you can learn from the wire from Breaking Bad you know all the conference rooms in my last company were named after characters in The Wire I just think I learned stuff from books I learned stuff from fiction movies I learn stuff from listening to a song I'm just like you know I remember like the first time one of my kids friends said I went to Irving Plaza and I saw this artist Billy ish and I was like who is Billy ish and he's like I would do anything for Billy ish and I was like whoa and I look and she is like one Spotify stream and I'm like holy [ __ ] like what is going on here and you know what is the thing there whatever she was not marketed she was discovered the audience was the one they were like she is by Billy eyh no executive in a high in a you know Tower somewhere said you're going to take Billy ish now and so they're all just like if you unpack why things work in the world and you're willing to get out there and experience them then I I think that that's the opportunity the the one second piece of advice I would give is that a lot of times you think it's about adapting to your environment I I I had a a student of mine and she went to work at Consulting and she was the only one who didn't get a job offer you know you get your whatever offer her to come back and she's like I don't know what's wrong with me like I messed up and like I got to figure out how to change and they told me I should stop talking so much in meetings or whatever and I said you just shouldn't work and Consulting like you are just you you are the best version of you you're just in the wrong situation and she goes to this startup and they're like you can't talk enough and they love her and she's so happy and I'm like you're the [ __ ] sa same exact person you just got to find the place that celebrates you for who you are and by the way you are you and you got to do the best to be the best you you can but you got to put yourself in the best place and you got to think about your inputs and you know your inputs aren't necessarily like you know the things that you think they are they might be going to the Sri Lankan restaurant in Staten Island and having a life-changing rooty and just rethinking everything you ever knew about the world there's some episodes where in the YouTube comments people are being like uh well I saw Shawn put his chin on his hand and just stare into the screen or or Sam just sat back cross his arms and kind of had his mouth open and he was just staring at the guest these guys have a new man crush I would say this is one of those episodes where uh I definitely do I appreciate you coming on thank you for not only this episode but also helping us when we were doing the milk Road it's not even one specific piece of advice you had but after we talked to you we were like we came away with a very strong sense of okay cool we're just going to do this our way like we don't need to conform this in any way if anything let's double down into all of the like quirks and weirdness and fun versions of what this could become and let's just play that out and see what happens and so that was the the one thing that we took away from from hanging out with you and I hope uh you know other people do that too because I don't think you get that advice I don't think you get that vibe from most people I get that listen I just played a long game if I could be helpful to you and then you're successful and then you buy an NBA team and then it's the playoffs and I want my feet on the hardwood then I'm hoping it days off I got you Dan thank you so much for coming on I appreciate you I appreciate you guys for having me see you soon [Music]

I went to this Tony Robbins event says we're going to play Simon say now this is a room of about 6,000 people the winner gets to come on stage and you're going to get this thing some good prize so the game starts half people get out on the first round within 5 minutes he's down to the winner winner gets up on stage and he had the final 10 people he said stay standing then he called on somebody he's like the guy who's standing you got to the final 10 the guy next to you when did you get out he's like I got out in like the second round did you believe you were going to win and the guy was like no I mean so many people silly game I don't know I didn't even think about it he goes so raise your hand if you when we started the game you believed that you could win only like you know 5% of the audience raise your hand so all of you thought you were competing with 6,000 people the only competition was amongst these 50 people who actually believe that there was a way to win and he's like I'm going to leave you with two ideas number one if you're going to play the game decide to win he's like you don't have to win every game but if you decide to play you should decide to win the second thing is that in life you believe you're competing with a much bigger pool of people than you actually are because the majority of people aren't even playing the game and of the people who playing the game most of them don't even believe that they can win you're only competing with the people who actually believe that there is a way to win

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
[Applause] all right turn on the camera turn on the camera I got a rant for [Music] you I got a call yesterday from a entrepreneur who was going through something that is so relatable they were stuck they're they're at a plateau their business is not growing as fast as they want they were pitching me on all the new things they were going to do new features they were going to add the new project and then they told start telling me about the side hustle that they got going on and I had to stop them and I had to tell them the truth the truth is stop searching for answers we are all guilty of this you know like if I'm fat all of a sudden I'm keto I'm paleo I'm reading books I'm listening to podcasts and I'm not just doing the obvious things the Trap that people fall into is thinking that the answer to their problems is elsewhere that maybe a a mentor has it or a book has it or there's some knowledge that they don't have and that's what's holding them back but that's really never the case if I talk to nine out of 10 people only one might need a strategy change for nine out of 10 the answer is up your level of intensity the best part about intensity is that it's contagious that you can actually create a culture of intensity there's a wonderful story about Peter teal when he was running PayPal so Peter teal was one of the he was a CEO of PayPal he's the first investor in Facebook and I was curious because Peter T's kind of like a sort of a weird dude and I was like he doesn't seem like a classic manager leader inspiring guy super organized button down running you know daily standups it turns out he didn't really do any of that he had a very simple system his Common Sense system was well everybody in the company should fig figure out one priority like you you should have one priority in your brain you're going to do one thing what's it going to be and forcing people to figure out one priority not a to-do list but a single priority was an incredible forcing function everybody had to say something and if you said something stupid it would be like that's your priority and so everybody picked one priority but now that's good but that's just like you know the very very first half of the what's the second half actually sticking to that because human nature is Everything feels important I have my one priority but then there's the second thing that's important too and then there's a third thing that's important too and the problem with this that Peter said was that imagine you have three priorities and even if you you stack rank them you said this is number one number two number three what happens is that we often don't know the answer to number one number one lacks a a clear solution it's a gnarly problem it's an important problem but it's not an obvious problem so what we do is we just gravitate towards the second task because it's much clearer I know what to do there so I I gravitate towards the known right it's that Warren Buffett story where the guy lost his keys outside of a bar so he's crawling around on the ground trying to find his keys and the officer says uh uh sir what are you doing he I'm looking for my keys did you drop them here no no no I dropped him over there well why you crawling over here because this is where the light is and that's how most people operate in their day-to-day priorities we crawl around where the light is we crawl around doing the known things the things that feel familiar to us rather than the important things the things where the solution actually is over there it's just in the dark and so Peter what he would do is if anybody tried to talk to him about something that was not their their big thing their one thing he would literally just leave the room he's like oh you're talking to me about that I thought your thing is this okay see you he's like I'm not going to sit here and try to convince you but I will signal to you that this is not a priority by literally just leaving the meeting or leaving the room or just not refusing to talk to you about anything besides your one thing to teal what he what he said was he goes if you allow yourself to have more than one Focus you've already blinked I love that you've already blinked you've flinched and he says you know you've determined that mediocrity is an acceptable outcome my singular Focus philosophy is that Solutions may not be clear but the paths to Excellence and value are and the path to Excellence and value is to have a singular focus and I believe this to be true I believe that the mind is a very powerful tool I call the brain a answering machine it's just about what question you ask it if you ask yourself a bunch of questions like um why did this person cut me off your brain will tell you because they're an because you've told your brain to focus its attention on why this person cut you off in traffic right you've focused your powerful tool on a silly thing to focus on and um you know the brain can really only handle one question at a time is not a m as much as we think we can multitask we really can't we can kind of solve one problem at a time it's just a question of what are you going to load into your brain and are you willing to let it sit there until it is solved that Peter teal one priority philosophy is a very powerful one and something that that I Implement on my day-to-day basis all right so first let me dispel some myths because I can already hear you in the comments I can hear you typ it away because what you're thinking is probably what I used to think which is dude I don't want to work 247 that's not my goal well intensity is not working 247 that's the first thing intensity is a Formula actually it is focus Times Common Sense times Insanity that's it Focus Times Common Sense times Insanity that is what I mean when I say intensity there's a great quote by the way I saw Conor McGregor and Conor McGregor's story is insane he went from a plumber on welfare to the highest paid richest athlete in the world on the Forbes list to the first two-weight world champion in the UFC and he did this all in like five or six years and there was a video of him after his training session I've lost my mind on this game like Vincent Van go dedicated his life to the his art and lost his mind in the process that's happened to me when that gold Bel was around on my waist my mother has a big mansion my girlfriend has a different car for every day of the week my kids kids have everything they ever want then it will pay and I and I'm happy I lost my mind yeah I'll die a crazy old man and that is the level of intensity and Insanity that you can get to if you really do this at a level 12 and not everybody's going to want to do this at level 12 but you should know what level 12 looks like you should know what it is and then you get to decide how you're going to dial that knob down the problem most people have is they think they're already at a level 10 they don't even consider level 12 they think they're already at 10 when in actuality they're at six and today I'm going to show you how you are at a six and you're not out of 10 because that is a lie it's a dangerous lie we want to tell ourselves the other misconception by the way is oh great I got to do more I'm already busy I'm already overwhelmed now I got to do more no no no it's actually the opposite you are going to end up doing less uh there's a great Steve Jobs quote I'm going to butcher it but it's basically something like focus is saying no to a 100 great ideas so you can say yes to the one exceptional one focus is saying no to a 100 great ideas great ideas are ideas that you could totally make a case for that you would it would seem smart for you to go do but doing a hundred of them doesn't work right you can do anything you just can't do everything and so focus is saying no to the great ideas so you can do the one exception one so if you do this right you're not doing more you're actually doing less you're just doing it better all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show okay let's jump into some examples and I'm going to start with some business examples because there's plenty of like inspirational athlete stories or just kind of like General motivation but this is business podcast I am all about business so let's do the first one so first one is Mark Zuckerberg so there's a great story of Zuck when he bought Instagram and by the way today if Facebook had not bought Instagram Facebook might be dead Instagram like literally ended up becoming the next social network it was going to be his biggest competitor and Facebook bought it well okay that's cool that's just a business decision right it's a strategy decision no no no it was a story of intensity so here's How The Story Goes the founder of Instagram Kevin cam used to work at a place called Odio he was uh actually kind of like an intern sitting at the desk next to this guy named Jack D Odio pivots to Twitter that becomes Twitter Jack dorsy ends up being the CEO of Twitter at one point in time and Jack dorsy is kind of like his mentor so Kevin creates Instagram Twitter doesn't have photo sharing Twitter says we want to buy Instagram and they offer to buy it for something like $400 $500 million and again this is they have the relationship they were first to make the offer they offered a big sum of money so they did what they thought was level 12 intensity but then Zuck came and showed them what's up so the way that the story goes down is Mark Zuckerberg starts texting Kevin Cam and he says um hey I want to meet I wanna I want to talk to you about buying the company and Mark intensity is almost known it's sort of legendary in the industry so Kevin is texting his investor and he's saying should I meet with Zuck I don't I'm worried if I if I go there I don't really want to sell and I feel like if I tell him I don't want to sell is he just going to go into like psycho mode and crush me and the investor goes yeah probably and so he's like okay I guess I'll take the meeting he already has a deal on the table to to Twitter for $550 million he then meets with seoa the number one VC in Silicon Valley and they say you know what you should stay independent Instagram can be big we will fund you at $500 million so same valuation but you get to keep going you get to keep your Independence but he goes to meet Zuck and he goes unlike Twitter Zuck did not take no for an answer so he rejects Zuck first Zuck says no no no just come over my house and talk can you just come over today and he says I guess I got to go over there I don't want to really piss this guy off so he just says okay I'll I'll just go over there so he goes to his house and now this is Good Friday you know Easter's on Sunday he goes to his house on Friday and he walks in and Zuck says the following he says I've thought about it and I want to buy your company and Kevin's like I know but I already said no he says I will give you double whatever you're you're currently raising around at so whatever your price is I'll give you double and that would mean that Instagram would be worth a billion dollars and nobody had ever paid this much for a mobile app before this would be the first deal of its kind Instagram had zero Revenue had like less than 20 employees it was tiny this seemed like outrageously over the toop way of going about things and Zuck said well look I can give you a billion dollars for this but here's the deal we got to do this deal this weekend and he basically pushed him and this was again it's Easter on Sunday nobody's working over the weekend the Twitter guys think that they have a deal in the bag the Sequoia guys think that they have a deal in the bag and the mistake they made was they thought that work starts on Mondays and Zuck just decided to work over the weekend so he basically said look let's stay here and we'll either hash out the deal and we'll make a deal happen or we'll figure out the deal is not going to happen but let's just agree we're going to stay here and we're going to figure it out so he says okay so they basically stayed together for 48 hours Zuck calls his lawyers he calls his Corp Dev guys he says get over here we got to figure out how we're going to close this deal now Kevin calls his investors he's like hey I'm thinking about having this deal and here's the quote one of his investor says I sat back and thought what just happened like holy what just happened how did he pull this off and Zuck had this belief that that if we don't create the thing that kills Facebook somebody else will the internet's not a friendly place I have to act with a certain of intensity when we find a deal that's like this and so over the weekend just to give you a perspective to do a billion doll deal generally takes time six months will go by nine months will go by Zuck his lawyers and the founder of Instagram they they end up cutting this deal over the weekend they do a billion dollar deal in 48 hours and by the time the competition woke up on Monday the deal was gone so that's the the story of how Zuck buys Instagram and by the way this is not the first time he also bought WhatsApp how he bought WhatsApp was the same way and WhatsApp had the right culture WhatsApp also operated with high intensity there's a famous story that the founder of WhatsApp had this sticky note on his desk and they took a picture of it when he sold and it said no ads no games no gimmicks that was their mindset every other messaging app was always adding more and more features they would add games they would add stickers they would add some some ads into it they would just keep adding things and they said the way we're going to win is we're going to do the basic thing messaging and we're just going to do it better than anybody else they were like Chick-fil-A have you ever been to a Chick-fil-A like you don't go to Chick-fil-A because Chick-fil-A adds fish filets on the menu no no no Chick-fil-A decided to have a common sense strategy we're going to sell chicken sandwiches and they just do it with a better level of intensity than anybody else they sell a better chicken sandwich In-N-Out does the same thing In-N-Out it's like we're gon to sell a burger and fries is not a revolutionary strategy they did not pivot they did not innovate in that they just brought a higher level of intensity to it than anybody else was willing to do at the time and so those two fast food chains make more money per location than chains that do 10 times more things that have a wider menu that have more locations because they operate with a higher level of intensity that's the same way that what'sapp and Zuck approached business the founder of WhatsApp always said he goes the FW around here is focus he says uh I don't think about things that I can't figure out I don't think about the future I don't go to conferences and give talks about where the industry is going he goes I focus my brain around the things that I can wrap my head around like this customer's complaining about this thing let me go fix that bug and he said that the reason they sold a Facebook was because Zuck chased them for two years personally he would meet them for coffee then a hike no deal would happen and he would keep inviting them hikes dinners coffees and he did that for two years until finally they relented and they ended up closing the deal okay I want to talk to you about stripe one of the stories I love about stripe comes from Paul Graham Paul Graham was you know running YC at the time when stripe went through it he met the founders early on and these were a couple of teenagers that were basically saying we're going to change the financial system we're going to change the payment system we're going to go work with banks and he's like these two you know redheaded teenagers think that they could do this all right well I'm curious let's see what happens and he noted that stripe was doing one thing very differently than the average company through YC remember YC is the best of the best so these guys were uncommon amongst the uncommon companies and so he called it the cison installation he said most companies when they would talk to a potential customer they would bump into another founder they would say oh yeah here's what we do they would say oh that's interesting that's cool he say oh awesome you're interested cool I'll send you a link uh I'll send you invite to the beta when we're ready and you can sign up that's what most people do he said what the cison would do was very different we started calling this the cison installation which would be as soon as somebody showed any sign of Interest they would say awesome do you have your laptop on you I can just set you up right now I'll do it for you and they would literally Brute Force get customers on board the person would open up their laptop and they would literally install stripe they would explain it to them and they would onboard them on the spot and they did this to the first you know 100 200 customers manually and Paul Graham noted he goes you know I want wonder why don't more people do this it's not like this was some outrageous strategy it's not that it was even like that hard to do he said the reason people don't do this is two things shyness or a fear of rejection um he goes also a misconception he goes they think that big things come from big things but actually big things come from an accumulation of smaller things I thought it was a beautiful way of putting it to understand how a big thing happens is just a accumulation of smaller things and he said that you know many people believe that startups you know take off or they don't take off that your business either works or it doesn't work and he said actually what I've learned doing YC is that startups happen because the founder makes them happen they take off because the founder makes them take off and he goes it's like an engine right you can't force something that's never going to work to work what you can do is if something has the potential to work you can crank that engine manually hand crank it to get it going and then it starts and once the engine started you know you pushed the boulder enough eventually it starts to roll and now you're chasing the momentum of it rolling downhill but at the beginning it felt like pushing it to the top of the hill and I thought that was a great analogy of how stripe operated with a higher level of intensity and if that's how they onboarded customers imagine how they did the 10 other things because how you do one thing is how you do everything the Trap that people fall into is thinking that the answer to their problems is elsewhere that maybe a a mentor has it or a book has it or there's some knowledge that they don't have and that's what's holding him back but that's really never the case so rarely is that the case almost always the answer you seek is within one of the great stories about this comes from Ben Horwitz he has this phrase he goes lead bullets not silver bullets and he's talking about when he was running his company they were at a very tough point there was tough competition the company was on the line it was it going to go go Bust or they were going to figure out a way to make it he go my first instinct was to Pivot to try to find a magical win it's a magical solution a rabbit out of a hat he's like I so wanted to stand in front of my company and say aha I have the answer I I went for this walk I met this guy and here's the answer we just got to do this and it'll all work out he said but that's not really how it worked he goes I I stood in front of the company and I told them I said there are no silver bullets for this only lead bullets they didn't want to hear that but I had to make it clear we simply had to build a better product there was no other way out there was no window no hole no escape hatch no back door we have to go through the front door and deal with the big ugly Glide that's blocking it we needed lead bullets in my experience the thing that's actually come out of this philosophy of there are no several bullets is that actually there are bullets but the only way you discover them is by just firing a ton of bullets that you think are lad and then you sort of pleasantly surprise yourself when you find one idea one experiment one uh tactic that totally works in an outsize way uh you find your silver bullet but the only way to do that is by being the guy who believes there are only lead bullets so that's I'm gonna I'm willing to fire all the lead bullets in order to make this work versus the guy who's going to run around trying to just find the one magical Silver Bullet and really take no action right if you want to look at your pie chart you should be spend spending maybe 10% of your time on the idea or the strategy side of things it is important to get a good strategy but it's usually a very common sense strategy if your strategy is convoluted if your strategy requires multiple new Innovations and leaps of Faith you are likely going to fail you are likely duding yourself into thinking that the pie chart is 80% ideas and 20% execution it's much more like 10 or 20% ideas and strategy and 80% Blood Sweat and Tears and that Blood Sweat and Tears should come from a certain level of intensity right it's not simply about working more hours it's not simply about just burying yourself in the office there are times where you'll do that and that's the other kind of philosophy that you should internalize which is there is a time to Sprint okay you cannot Sprint the whole time you cannot always be running your max speed it doesn't work that way but you should be able to recognize when you need to change years and you need to Sprint one of the stories I love I've talked about this in the podcast before is the story of Sylvester Stallone Sylvester Stallone wants to be an actor and so goes in the auditions everywhere and he can't get a get a role nobody wants to cast him as an actor he doesn't look the part his mouth moves a little funny because he had a problem at Birth and he just wasn't the guy he wasn't the Classic Hollywood face he doesn't give up he decides take matters into his own hands he says if I can't get cast in a movie I will make a movie and I will give myself the role H the problem is he hates writing so he decides well I'm gonna for this I got a Sprint I'm gonna do this thing at the best I can but I will plow through I will brute force my way to this so he goes to his house and decides to write a movie he writes the first script of Rocky the rough draft of Rocky in three days three days most people don't think that's possible he did in three days he talks about how he did it I want to read you this quote this this is sylvest Salone talking about uh Focus his daughter asked him she goes did you really paint your windows black to focus he goes yeah I did paint them black because I didn't want to know what time it was it didn't matter what time it was it was time to write otherwise I would tell myself oh it's time to for time for breakfast and I would immediately myself I would say well I'm just going to have breakfast when I'm hungry I don't need to know what time it is and that was the kind of thing you know I wanted to eliminate all my possible excuses all my possible distractions because I knew how hard it was for me to write I was begging when I was writing please someone just call the phone just please get me to do anything else besides this but instead I unplugged the phone so that nobody could call I painted the windows black he says 100% black windows no phone and that approach of painting the windows black is a certain level of intensity he doesn't do it all the time but he knew there was a time to Sprint so one of the key things in life is to identify when a great opportunity comes your way or when it's time to buckle down this is the moment it's you're going on One path or the other path and that is the time to Sprint that is the time you dial up your level of intensity so I have three actions for you how do you actually go do this first you need to narrow your focus I did a whole podcast on this called laser focus go watch that it's like 20 minutes long it's good so you need to narrow your focus you need to stop giving your brain so many different priorities and so many different problems to think about you need to narrow it down that's the first thing Focus the second thing is you need to write down your common sense solution I call it a common sense solution because that's the check your solution to your problem should sound very easy it should sound as simple as I got to go figure out why all these people are churning canceling their subscription I need to go solve that or I need to make better product I need to make a product so good that people want to share it that's my strategy make a product so good that people want to share it my strategy is I need to make 30 sales calls a day if I want sales to grow I just need to do more calls 30 a day I'm going to take a giant sticky note I'm going to write 30 and every day I'm gonna cross that 30 out and then tomorrow I'm gonna wake up and the first thing I do is I write the big number 30 Again by the way this is something I actually did uh for my companies write a giant number on the wall and that number is the one thing I need to do today if I do that one thing alone I have made today successful so you need a common sense strategy that you can execute so like a no-brainer fifth grader strategy that you can execute at a level 12 and that's the last question the last thing you need to do is ask yourself what was what would level 12 intensity look like at this thing that I'm doing just as a thought experiment you don't even have to do it but just ask yourself that question right if I dialed the intensity knob all the way to 12 what would that look like what would I actually do I'll give you a very simple example A lot of people probably you out there listening to this have had a goal at some point in time of getting in better shape right you want to lose weight you want to go run a marathon at a certain time whatever you want to get into your the best shape of your life and we've taken what we think is a level 10 intensity to this right I did I did the best I could do right I uh I hired a coach or I you I I I wrote down my goals and I I tried it just didn't work out well Jesse Isler a guy's been a guest on this podcast he had the same goal as you he wanted to get in the best shape of his life he wanted to get in the best running shape of his life so what did he do he hired a Navy SEAL to come live in his house and whoop his ass every day he said I will do everything you tell me to do whatever time you tell me to wake up I wake up what however many miles you tell me to run I'll run he would train two to three times a day for 30 days straight he ate exactly what this guy said he drank exactly what this guy said he did pull-ups when this guy said do pull-ups he ran when this guy said run it was raining it was hailing outside it was freezing cold he get out there and he would run that Navy SEAL by the way was David gogins this is before David gogins was even popular he hired David gogins to come live in his house for 30 days he would come into the bedroom where him and his wife were sleeping and wake him up and say wake up we're running now that was level 12 intensity and the sad part is we don't even know what level 12 looks like until we've heard something like this so if I did one thing for you today I hope I just inspired you to go figure out what level 12 intensity even looks like maybe from the examples I gave you today maybe from some people in your life find a way to see it and find a way to ask yourself what does level 12 look like if I ratcheted up the intensity of the thing I'm already doing that's it [Music] h

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
I was making a small amount of money for something I hated and then I started making a large amount of money for something I would have done anyway like it was [Music] fun all right what's up we got our friend at the house Andrew Wilkinson Here Andrew famously is the co-founder of tiny he started off as a barista ended up creating a design agency that was super super successful designed and a bunch of other popular uh Silicon Valley products that you may have may have used started buying businesses read about Warren Buffett read about Charlie Monger started buying businesses now owns like you know a portfolio of 30 plus companies I think and recently took the company public and then stepped down to CEO and Andrew is here on his uh I don't know vacation tour after stepping down to CEO Andrew good to see you man your skin looks great the glow looks good you seem happy you got that non-operator glow enough about talking how much of a babe you are all so Andrew I sent you a voice note you started off as a barista at a coffee shop and you've done very well in business and I said I want to know what were the different jumps like income jumps that actually made a difference and you said there was four levels yeah totally well I think the best money that I ever made was jumping from being a barista to making like 60 bucks an hour well so you go from Barista you start designing websites so you go from 650 an hour to $60 an hour and it sounds like that might have been somewhat happen stance did you was that intentional to make that shift or just kind of you got an opportunity a lucky bounce came your way what made that shift happen so I was working making coffees every day for all the people that come in and there's these two guys that would come in every single day they'd roll in looking like they just got out of bed at 10:00 in the morning they're probably like 5 years older than me so like 24 25 and they would just come in and they would sit on their laptops all day just drinking espresso after espresso and one day I asked them what do you guys do like don't you have jobs and uh they gooh we're web designers we just walk into random businesses we ask them if they have a website and then we say we make one for 500 bucks and so that day I was like well forget this like I don't want to make the espresso I want to be drinking the espresso I want to be these guys and so I went and I bought a book on web design and a couple days later I walked into a place and sold the guy website and within a couple weeks I'd quit my job wait did you know anything about design yeah I did actually because when I was a teenager I had a tech News website and I knew how to use like Dream Weaver like really basic web design and stuff um so it like wasn't rocket science to me like I knew these guys were smart but they weren't you know they didn't have any crazy qualifications it was nothing I couldn't learn and uh so I just kind of dove in and got lucky do you remember who you approached that first one yeah it was a pulled pork barbecue joint and uh it was this place called Pig here locally and uh and yeah it was like I think I got like 500 bucks and some free uh pulled pork sandwiches you know I basically got unlimited sandwiches for a while that's pretty awesome I was making a small amount of money for something I hated and then I started making a large amount of money for something I would have done anyway like it was fun it was fun designing websites and coding websites the first money I really ever made outside of like a college job when I was in school was I actually won a business plan pitch competition and we won $25,000 of cash and they made some NBA some gra business school student work for us for 5K and said we won $30,000 of total comp and me and my two co-founders lived for one year together on $25,000 but it was awesome like we didn't really know how much money a business takes we didn't know we didn't know how much money it takes to live because we just been in college the whole time so to us that was like oh that'll last us a long time and we lived off of it for one year but it was the best money at that time it was it was a big jump because we didn't have to get a job so it was Freedom it's like oh we don't even have to think about money or a job because we got the lumpsum cash up front and um and we got to go do the go go try the thing we wanted to try you know together as friends so that that was probably the F that was the first level and uh like Andrew saying the early dollars create a lot more freedom than the later dollars I think is the way that that you're explaining it and those early early dollars and early freedom matter a lot more than the later dollarss because you only get so much incremental freedom in fact you might actually get less Freedom if you start buying a bunch of [ __ ] that now you are a slave to my first level was almost the same as yours Sean it was $24,000 I think I was 23 or maybe 24 I had a small website that I sold but I still had to work there it was basically an aqua hire but after taxes and everything was said and done I think I had $24,000 at the time I was spending $2,000 a month in living expenses and I said I have a year I have a year of expenses saved up and I felt like I was like let's go to Australia like let's live like let's go take a trip let's go to Thailand like having $24,000 I felt incredibly wealthy by the way that's a powerful thing to do is change the denomination into time instead of money so you know if you have $24,000 or $36,000 or $90,000 it's kind of like Chuck-E-Cheese money it's tokens that you don't really understand what this does for you and what most people do is they uh they just sort of keep working blindly they'll put it in the bank and then they don't really know how to use it what to do with it a more important question is how do I get myself a year of Freedom or 18 months of Freedom where I could either just go enjoy myself purely or go take a shot at creating a new life for myself a new chapter a new A New Path for myself and early on it doesn't take much to get a year like both of us basically did it on $25,000 which I think is surpr it's surprising even for me to hear it right now because my current life burn rate's a lot higher right but you know we slept on air mattresses it's like well why do we need you know and then we got to got to Mattress and headboard money eventually but at first doesn't really matter but a year of Freedom or 18 months of Freedom 24 months of freedom is a good way to denominate things when you don't have a huge sum of money I Ed this app I didn't use mint I used this one app where every time I spent anything I typed it in how much money I'd spent for that so if I went and got coffee was 250 I wrote 250 in there and then I had this spreadsheet where I took the average of the trailing six months and I said that is my monthly burn and then here's how much money I've saved get to 12 months and so I used an app all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium news letter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show all right so you you made it to level two now the next level you said I went from self-employed to boss so what does that mean what I over time discovered was that there was all these online job boards and there was companies in San Francisco posting looking for freelance designers and developers and stuff so I was doing these like little $500 local websites and I found these Silicon Valley startups posting and this was like what like what you would call today like product design or interface design and so I got this project designing an interface for an ad manager for some startup and I did a really good job the guy really liked it and it was like $2,000 for basically no work this is the project I mentioned before so was like maybe five days of work for two grand which ended up being 2600 bucks Canadian so it's very sweet and the guy goes hey this is pretty good um can you do coding like can you do some JavaScript work and I just say yes and I don't know anything about JavaScript I'm like whatever I can figure it out so I frantically try and learn JavaScript and I can't and so I go to my friend who's literally just my girlfriend's best friend's boyfriend who's in computer science and I say hey how much would you charge me to do this JavaScript scpt work and he goes I'll do it for 500 bucks and so I think I'm going to get negotiated down by this client and so I go to the client and I say it'll be a thousand bucks and they say okay sounds good and so in that moment I was like oh my God I just made $500 and I did absolutely no work so that's that crazy transition of going from being a self-employed person selling your time to being someone who can sell other people's time which to me is like the big leverage Point that's great you so you have that realization did you start uh devouring any books or how did you learn how to do that better than uh you know than than being an absolute rookie at it it was mostly trial and error in the beginning and it was really it was really stressful honestly because I think when you start delegating to other people they always do a worse job than you do and so you are kind of panicking and you there's no there's no like process or system or anything and around that time I read this book called the eth uh it's kind of cheesy it's by Michael Gerber but I recommend it to everyone and he really talks about this idea of trying to think of your business as a machine right and I think for me that was the that was a big breakthrough that mental model of my business is a machine and I'm the engineer and all the different people are widgets within the machine and if one doesn't work or something is squeaky you can swap out the people but at the end of the day you have a process you have a strategy and you have people on the bus and if you have the right people on the right bus the right strategy and the right Vision things will go well and that was when things really took off that was when I started hiring um you know I had like a dozen people I was making you know over a million dollars a year personally uh you know I got a BMW I started dressing nice and really that was like the the kind of sloppy like the first phase was like you know okay I can do all the stuff I wanted to do in college I can buy beer I can go for a nice dinner and stuff wait how how old were you when you made your first is that million profit yeah I think I was 20 22 or 23 somewhere in there that's huge oh yeah it was amazing you didn't go to college right or you dropped out I dropped out of college I I went to journalism school for like two or three months so you did a million in profit two years into being an agency I started when I was 19 years old and so probably four years in something like that three or four years in that's massive it was it was crazy I mean it felt like it felt like an absolute fortune and frankly it was and at that point like that was when I was like oh like I'll just buy whatever I want like I would walk into Best Buy and just buy like a crazy TV I would buy you know the best speakers money could buy I would buy video games like whatever an idiot 23y old wants to spend money on I would spend money on that and ultimately $800 you're like okay well now what my taste don't even match my my my income right now yeah it was very it was very kind of empty and hedonistic did you ever read Rich Dad Poor Dad Andrew yeah he has that uh Sam you read that book he's got that quadrant thing do you know about that yeah people hate on that guy I'm not sure why but what what about it well I mean any uh any business guy who becomes popular um and start selling anything I think he sells a lot of [ __ ] he sells like gold he sells like real estate courses he sell a lot of stuff but Andrew you basically just described his thing I remember reading this book and I had this mental model then of what you're supposed to do in your career so basically he's like he has this four quadrant grid and it's basically e is the first one you're an employee you have a job and he's like for most people this is what your parents tell you go to good go to a good school so you can get a good job and they kind of make it sound like getting a good job is the end point that is the like that's the end of the rainbow that's the pot of gold and what he's what he points out he's like you know basically you start as a e then you go to the bottom quadrant s where self-employed so you go from employed to self- employ that's what you describe Barista to solo freelance web designer then you go to B business owner that's when you owns your agency and the last one is I he's like the goal the goal for everybody is to get to I where you're an investor your money works for your money and you do whatever the hell you want um and so and eventually with tiny you became ah you became an investor but like this path going from esbi is one that for me I didn't even really I didn't understand how the board game was laid out I didn't know where you're supposed to go right it's like playing a video game but not understanding you you need to save the princess from the castle um it's like oh once I know that now I start to move in that direction but until I even knew that I didn't really even understand what the hell I was supposed to be doing this one diagram was very useful for me and that was in level two for you was between what a million dollars a year and what was your upper limit yeah I mean I was paying myself 500 to a million a year and I was profiting more than that and I started uh incubating businesses and so I had that classic thing where I had overconfidence the way I would put it is that my first business was a very easy business so I did the equivalent of walking into the gym and I got lucky I picked up really lightweights and it built my confidence and then for the next five 10 years I would walk into the gym and try and deadlift 300 pounds but I didn't know that was hard right and so I started an e-commerce business I started a restaurant I started multiple software businesses that I bootstrapped and lost in one case over10 million do um but it was really fun because I would just be in the shower and I would think oh man that's a great business idea I'll start that right now today uh I had no filter whatsoever and it was really exciting frankly like I was just I was constantly starting new stuff starting a restaurant's an awesome way to lose money though oh yeah and I lost uh I think I lost a million bucks doing that you still have it cat furniture uh restaurant skin cream SAS company you tried uh you did the the full decathalon of like business ideas we had a Blog we had a viral blog we tried to write a book for it um we had a coner service what was the viral blog we had clients from hell it was like really big on Tumblr for a while do you know it we we basically we would we would have all these like um we' go to conferences and meet other designers and stuff and everyone would [ __ ] about their crazy clients and share screenshots of like insane emails they had received and stuff where it's just like the guy asking for them to make the logo bigger over and over again and so we started sharing those and it just went crazy viral and so we ended up making a book dude we need to bring back Tumblr Tumblr was great I love the I love the Tumblr days I I still go back and I'll read old people's tumblers it's awesome I love it I mean Twitter kind of is that now but I felt Tumblr had a better environment and it was uh more friendly and better content I made so many friends from Tumblr and I still meet people like at conferences that know me from Tumblr back in the day what age were you when level three ended or level two ended um I ended that probably like 207 I think that was when I sold my first business what did you sell it for and what was it so I sold it for 7 million bucks and it was the one business I started in level two so I started all these different companies I so I had my original web design company metalab it was profitable I would live off part of that profit and then the rest of it went to starting all those other businesses I talked about the one business that worked was I met Toby from Shopify um and Harley as well in 2010 at a conference and at the time Shopify was pretty small and they said hey we really love your design work would you make some templates some themes for Shopify and I was like oh you know I guess we could do these guys a favor they seem nice I tried to get them to pay me and they actually said said no no no this is going to be like a store like the iPhone app store and I was like uhh like okay I guess so and so we did it I literally thought we were doing them a favor and we put up a bunch of themes in their store and we started making like 10 $20,000 a what a month a month like basically immediately and what year what year was that 2011 probably 2011 2010 2011 all right 2011 you're doing 20 or 30 grand a month is this called pixel Union it's called pixel Union and so I have the I had the original design agency I had pixel Union and that started making quite a bit of money and then I had all these chaotic other businesses and basically what happened was I decided that I wanted to have like a nest egg I wanted to have enough money in the bank that I didn't have to worry about money anymore and because what I what I had had is cash flow I had a ton of cash flow but I never kept much money in the bank I'd spend whatever I needed personally everything else would get invested even though I didn't really understand investing in these businesses I was incubating and so I ended up getting an offer to sell that business for 7 million bucks and it was three million up front one and a half earn out and then the rest in stock in the new business and I remember I went to the ATM on the day it closed and I checked my balance I was in like a strip mall and I saw 3 million it was like 3,00,000 or something like that on the chit and I was like I'm done like I'm rich I'm good forever and that was a big mindset shift suddenly I had money more money than I could use to incubate businesses I'd also incubated a lot of businesses and I realized that starting companies is really hard if you think about my failure rate I probably started 10 different projects or companies and one of those worked really well and so there was a lot of pain and I had to lay a lot of people off and go through a lot of hard times to do that and frankly I felt pretty burnt out and around that time I was like well I guess I've got to learn how to invest but to me investing was something that like guys in suits did like it was super boring I had no interest in real estate or stocks but I'd always heard about Warren Buffett and when I read about Warren Buffet that changed everything for me what I what I ended up doing is I had all the the incubated businesses I actually shut almost all of them down and I'd sold the that business for 3 million I had another one and a half coming and I also got dividends out of that business because I still in 20% of it and then metalab by this point was making three or four million do of profit a year and so I went from burning a lot of cash and living a nice lifestyle to suddenly having a pile of cash and a lot of unencumbered cash flow coming in that just kept piling up so by that point if you think about if you're making four or5 million a year at this point point I buy a really nice house not as crazy I could have gone crazy but I I bought like a responsible nice house I bought uh you know a nice a nicer car I bought myself like a Porsche and I had a Tesla which at the time was like super crazy and I started getting into investing at this point what was this 20% rule you had so basically I was like I I will spend up to 20% of my cash flow personally and the other 80% has to go back to investing and so I knew that you know on 20% of 5 million bucks you know I could live a pretty damn good life spending a million dollars a year I wouldn't go out of my way to spend that much post tax or pre pre-tax so I would I would basically live it up as much as possible but then I also knew I'd always be compounding the rest and that model actually worked really well for me because I didn't have this mindset that so many entrepreneurs have where they're like [ __ ] I got to live like a popper and then I got to become a prince I got to sell my company for some huge amount of money I was just able to live on cash flows the entire time Sam can we talk about some of your popper what the [ __ ] is a poer poer Tendencies you had as Sam chugged at Dr Pepper while you were talking so Sam what were you doing when you were building the hustle how did you live were there any uh cheap skate uh my wife work at Facebook at the time so dinner was with like I gave her tupp Weare containers and she would bring home uh Pudo and cheese CU they always had like shud report so I was dinner was by by met every so we uh we I I was on a Pudo diet because I didn't get old fast the second thing I'm ashamed to say I did this but listen to this so do you guys remember when um uh Uber Eats and door Dash and what were the other ones caviar so these meal delivery services all came out the same time and you would get $20 for free for your first order so I built a iPhone emulator on our computer where we created this ring where we were constantly referring each other to these like new so I basically had like $5,000 of uh free caviar so I would basically people would be like is your startup funded I was like no but we are fueled we're fueled by VC but we're not funded and so I did that for a long time I also would sneak on the bus and not pay and I would get caught all the time but the thing is is if they ask for your ID you just say you don't have an ID and so that was that's not it's not illegal not to have an ID so I got away with like two grand worth of bus tickets yeah there's nobody checks in San Francisco they did I used to get trouble all the time but they would say uh you know do you have your ID I'm like I don't have an ID uh so I'll tell you you know but yeah so hopefully there's a statute of limitations on these things because I definitely broke the law a little bit I was also on I was on a whole food scholarship as well uh let's just say that the uh the the hot bar was right next to the exit so so Andrew you when you were spending uh 20% pre-tax that's like you're spending 40% of your post tax money that's a lot to be spending during that time and then you shifted it you you once you started investing you made a change you're like no no more 20% rule you changed it to some other rule right right what what did you shift to yeah I just kept dropping that percent over time as as the numbers got bigger I just kept dropping it and dropping it and dropping it and uh not because you were spending less no not necessarily I in some cases I was spending more the numbers just got bigger so around this time so so I'll talk about some of the things I started doing so I started Angel Investing so you know I'd meet a friend or some interesting entrepreneur and I'd invest 25 Grand in their company and if I look back like I probably should have bought stocks in real estate like I didn't understand the lack of liquidity in that and just how like high risk it is and crazy so I have a whole bunch of investments from that era I have no idea what's going to happen with them but mostly a lot of that time was actually spent having this breakthrough moment of realizing that I don't need to be the CEO that I don't need to run my own companies and so at that time every single company I was the CEO of it so as me and Chris I'm the CF CEO he's the CFO and we're just jumping around like chickens with our heads cut off between all the different businesses and when I read about Warren Buffett I was just like oh my God this guy has abstracted business to the craziest degree to the point where he doesn't actually do anything except for read and buy like one business a year and the idea that you could just hire a CEO to run your company was kind of crazy like I think a lot of people have this feeling around you know why would someone come and work for me I felt like that all the time I Fel I'm like yeah you're like what are you doing yeah this it's like why like don't you know the math like this doesn't make any sense but then over time you realize like people want stability and they want shity and they want to have health benefits and all this stuff you don't get and so I realized like there's this whole other class of people where they want to run a company for somebody else they want to be a CEO they want to be able to make you know millions of dollars but they don't necessarily need to make like a billion dollars and that was crazy for me when I started hiring CEOs because before I knew it all the businesses started like doubling and the reason they doubled was because I was only giving 20% of my time to all the companies and frankly I didn't know what I was doing and I just started hiring better and better people to run my companies and there's this crazy inflection point where we started spinning out the companies hiring CEOs and then buying new businesses and just putting CEOs in to run those businesses and when we started doing that the numbers scaled really really quickly so you you did a lot of Angel Investing in this period and and I we'll talk about the rest of the stage but have you seen a good return from those Investments because that's that was a good ERA yeah I mean I don't know to be honest the problem with Angel Investing is like I just still I slowed down but I mostly just do it on gut and so I think I have like 25 or $30 million adventure and it's just been this like death by a thousand paper cuts thing so I think if you take that cohort I had one my friend Stuart who we used to share an office with I put 75 grand into his business and then he sold it to workday and I 10x my money there and I think that that between that and a few other Investments I think I've definitely got my money back from that cohort maybe made a good you know a reasonable return but the problem is I've just kept going and I don't really track it like it's all in one big Excel spreadsheet somewhere and I don't mark it $25 million of Angel Investments that's that's a ton maybe even 30 that's an insane amount of Angel Investing what that's that's fiscally irresponsible my friend I know I know that's the problem with 10x is not going to return all that money how do why do you think you've returned $30 million I don't think that's not saying I've returned 30 million I've literally put $30 million into Venture I know but you say you broke you may be broken even right you think you think you no oh no no no to be clear I'm think you full of [ __ ] you're telling me you don't have a spreadsheet that just like if I have 30 no my friend no it doesn't matter if you're a billionaire if you or many billions ofes you track $30 million that's not that's not couch money regardless of who you are no so I actually have I've when I say I return I mean from that cohort so like maybe I invested like2 or3 million over that period and I'm saying I might have got that money back but the rest Mo so much of it was done over the last 10 years in in bursts that I don't even know I don't know where we're at in terms of payback I honestly I don't track it because it's such a pain in the ass to get Mark to markets and I don't trust them and so I'm literally just going either they sell or we get liquidity or we don't and so for me it's all marked at Book value until it I think it sounds crazy but that that is actually uh more par for the course I think for for the way Angel Investing works because I think if you're listening to this you don't Angel invest it sounds insane um and there is a bit of it that's insane that's in that's a very big number to to have to have put into it but these are like 10year Odyssey people stop sending updates even when they raise at upu rounds you don't fully believe you don't fully know if that's you can't really take that and count that uh until it's fully realized and so it is very easy to lose track of portfolio and where it's at because you don't really know where it's at that's kind of reality a company will raise money at some huge valuation and then a year later it's gone out of business and so I've I've I've invested a lot of money in Angel as well and like I track which company and which year I invested in but half of them don't send updates the other half they have markups and I'll put it in there but I don't count it as real net worth and then all the and then another portion when they sell you don't know they're going to sell until when the deal's done a large part of the time I count it as my net worth by the way as the principal I invested but half totally 100% that's how I think about it too I think of it as roulette and I think like this period that we're talking about was about me learning how to play poker right poker has way better odds than roulette if you're good at poker you can actually win you've got you know 60% odds when you play roulette you got 50% odds it's a terrible game and Angel Investing is frankly a roulette table you're just having fun and it's fun to be able to say you know oh I gave this entrepreneur who ended up building this great company 25 Grand along the way but I've realized it's a lot more kind of soulless than playing poker it's more fun you feel smart playing poker you feel dumb playing roulette also the the narratives we tell ourselves it's just like roulette where you're like I knew it I thought 11 was coming because I saw an 11 flash up over there and then that's why and if you if you talk to a lot of Angel Investors it's like you know you bet on two guys when they had a different idea and then it turned you know you you bet on Stuart Butterfield when he was building a game and then it turns into slack and you know did you know you might have known that Stewart was good but did did you really know you know and I think a lot of people uh attribute skill to where there was luck or uh and not not the other way around it sucks that you making your money you're making your money right at the beginning of the greatest bull market in American history and so starting in 2010 or so you're you know what the average returns are for the last 15 years for S&P 500 before inflation I think it's 14% which basically means you double your money every five years so what would that be 1 million become 2 million become 4 milli million so you would have forx your money just doing that boring [ __ ] but that's way more boring yeah that's the thing I think my one of my regrets looking back is I wish that I had bought apartment buildings or something really boring just as a diversification thing and stocks and just been really disciplined there and instead you know I was maybe I I was just shoveling you know $100,000 a month out to all these different startups and then that number went up and up and up over time as I had more free cash to deploy and again like I have winners in there like I invested in SpaceX I've invested in some great funds there's some awesome companies in there but to Sean's Point like unless you're reporting the LPS and making up numbers frankly with u rounds like you just have to wait yeah all right first of all thank you for sharing all those levels because a it's interesting and B you don't have to and most people do not props you for being transparent about it and also the takeaway I have is like it takes a lot wandering and you go through these eras you go through these phases it's kind of the same way you were talking about Tumblr it's like yeah I had my teen emo phase it's like yeah you go and experiment over there and then you kind of learn you have some fun but you kind of learn that's not it that's not the right path for me and it sounds like you had a bunch of those and I'm glad you shared it I want to ask you you have a question on here do you really need to be a billionaire uh what are your thoughts on that I we forgot one level we forgot one level what's the last level so so last level is when I took my company public public and I had tens of millions of dollars in the bank both in my companies and personally and what's weird is i' reached the end right I think that's the goal that so many entrepreneurs think they want and what I realized is even then with all that money in the bank I was still anxious I still fought with my partner I still got irritated with day-to-day life problems like ultimately like it's kind of like travel we all think we want to go to Bali if only I moved to Bali then I'd be happy the problem with moving to Bali is your brain comes with you and it turned out my brain is just really anxious before I had anything I would want to pump my own chest all the time because I felt like I haven't lived up to my potential once you know I got lucky and things kind of worked out I was like you know I'm G to not talk about this [ __ ] anymore because there's more to life now and this burden does feel weird I don't even want to bring it up so I'm just going to be kind of a little more private about this why why not just act like that because I wish somebody had told me it's kind of like um oh money didn't make you happy H kind of figured that meaning you made a bunch of money and it didn't fundamentally change your overall level of happiness or these materialistic things didn't make you happy I think you're probably smart enough to have not been totally surprised by that um what did surprise you well I think what surprised me was the weight of the money right right so you know we I wrote this in the prep doc but like this question of like do you really need to be a billionaire or do you want to be a billionaire but you wanted to be I wanted to be I always wanted to be because I didn't have enough money growing up money was a four-letter word in our house right my parents thought about money all the time and so in my weird little anxious child brain I said Okay I want as much money as possible if I have a lot of money then everyone will stop fighting and I think what was counterintuitive is that it didn't it didn't cause that so it actually caused familial Discord it didn't get me friends it isolated me from other people CU I was unrelatable what's the thing you wish somebody told you so you wish somebody told you hey these things are not going to fundamentally make you happy the anxiety you're carrying you're going to carry it over here too what do you wish that they told you instead the question is like what's the actual amount of money you want to spend each year that makes you happy and just working in Reverse from there and then figuring out okay what is my life's work after that I think over shooting is a mistake that a lot of people make myself included and I think they think okay I need to be a billionaire or be worth hundreds of millions of dollars when in reality that is overdoing it it's like you know look you have you have one you have a belly and you can only eat so much food why do you need 100x that amount of food if you have 100x the amount of food you need well it's actually kind of stressful because a it's wasteful you don't want the food to go bad and you got to do something with the food and so the book frankly is like it's kind of like a letter to myself 10 years ago to say like hey you don't need to go there like just like good things are not where you think they are if money so you're in a weird position where your job is uh you know as an investor your job is you're doing a good job based on your return so you're you're doing a good job based off how much money your your your clients or your you yourself make but if money wasn't part of it would you still be investing did you just get into that to make money or or is this how you'd spend your time regardless I really like relationships and I think business is a great way to build relationships that sounds kind of cheesy but like business is a shared language where if I meet even a like a guy who owns a plumbing company I know I'll be able to get along with him because we speak the same language we can we can get into interesting conversations and through that I can make friends and I've found that my for me like my zone of Genius is like building relationships with people and so if I can build relationships with people people and invest in their businesses or buy buy their businesses um that that like I'm really happy doing that I love doing that so Andrew if you were going to go back and you said you should calculate how much you want to spend every year and then kind of work backwards from that so let's do the math what would you you get to go in a time machine you go back to 25y Old you and you get to have this conversation what what would you write down on the pen and paper to figure that out well I think what you want to figure out is you want to say what do I want to spend every year and then times it by 20 what do you think you would want to spend every year back then I think I think a million I mean okay so let me put it this way so a million dollars you can live an incredible life and have one house go on incredible vacations like you can live an amazing life if you want to fly private add another million dollars so that's $2 million um and then you want a buffer so call it three and that allows you you know you basically go you you get into hobbies and toys and you collect cars or do whatever you want right so called three million bucks so what's three time 20 so $60 million I think $60 million if you've got it liquid that's you know you can live an incredible life and spend three to4 million a year and uh and it's awesome so that's how I think about it that's your target then you'd work backwards from that and you also had these like three steps uh that you texted us I don't know exactly what they mean but you said Launchpad enough and life's work what do those mean yeah so I I think these are these really are the kind of goals that everyone should have so Launchpad is like how do you make 250k year right and ideally passive and if you can make 250k a year passive then you don't need a job and you have the freedom to be generative and start the things that you want past that enough is like what's the amount you what's the what's the number what's that number we were just talking about that you want to spend every year and how do you work backwards from there so phase one might be you start a business let's say some online business it makes you 250k a year passive great that's your Launchpad then for the next five or 10 years you try and build up to that net worth number that you really want to get to call it you know 2030 $40 million whatever that is and then you've got complete freedom and then this is where the hard part comes in which is discovering your life's work it's like what is that thing that you're just intrinsically drawn to that creates meaning and ALS Al how do you take the byproduct of your machine you've now built a money machine right all your Investments and all your businesses and the byproduct of that is money and how do you make meaning out of that money for some people it's compounding in more businesses for other people it's giving it away and doing philanthropy for others it's doing art projects or whatever it is and I think that's the hard part is figuring out that second Mountain they call it Sean have you done the math like have you thought about that for you what's yours yeah I did I did a long time ago before I sold my first business I did this math my assumption was that I would spend $300,000 a year and then I tried to do the four or five% uh assuming that that's four or five% of your total I forgot what it was I remember getting to six million and I uh so what is that math that's yeah 300 that's exactly it so 300,000 a year of spending and I thought 6 million that's the Target and I drilled that into my brain I said Financial Freedom is at 6 million uh 6 million means you know I could spend whatever I want and I made it like part of my like all of my passwords when I would log in it had the number six in it and I did all these things I just kept at that time I was like really focused on it um and I think actually it was like the right it was the right way to think about it uh you know today I probably spend a little bit more than that so it's not like it's it's not like I was way off in my estimate uh but I think round number 10 million is Financial Freedom for almost everybody and 10 million is not that hard to get to if you do if you own a business um you should be able to get to you know let's call it one to two million a year profit a year and sell that thing for you know somewhere between five and five and 10x multiple depending on what industry you're in that's not a hard way to get to 10 million it's hard but it's simple yeah I guess like what I mean is like most people will never get to True Financial Independence where they're like yes I've made it I don't have to worry about money ever again right that's a very lucky few people few percentage of the population like I'll tell you this I did this thing the other night which I'm not really proud of I uh I went on LinkedIn and I searched my college class uh so like okay let me go look at Duke 2010 dude that's my that's my Friday night routine I do it every Friday night at one o' I literally did this on a Friday night I got it on my schedule I got a reminder on my calendar at 1:00 a.m. uh Friday night I got to like you joke this is literally what I did my kids with to bed my wife went to bed and I was like all right dig in baby let's do this I had never done it before but I was like let's do this and I knew at the time I'm doing this for kind of a effed up reason which is I just wanted to feel good about myself I was like I kind of knew I was like I think I've done well relative to the people in my class but I knew maybe skill or intelligence or talent wise or even work ethic wise I was definitely average to maybe below average in my class and I so I was scrolling through it I was looking and and it was amazing man these people who I I know these people these people were smarter Than Me Harder working than me more talented than me um they're doing like just kind of random jobs and I texted my college room me and I was like man it's crazy that like this person this one this one girl I remember I was like she literally could have been president like she was polished she was a phenomenal speaker super hardworking just knew everything about everything and I was like and today she was like running uh she was like an e-commerce manager at some Ecom brand that sells like you know some food product online and nothing wrong with that that's not like a bad thing but I definitely feel like you know the potential was there for a lot more if somebody had kind of sat us down and said look here's a blueprint here's a path that could get you to complete Financial Independence like if somebody our senior year had come and said look how much do you even know how much money you want and need I'm like none of us would have known it's like do the math you sort of get there you think okay maybe you get to five million or 10 million bucks and they said do you know how do you get there and I would have been me as a senior would have said I have no clue how you get there is that do I salary and save up like what am I supposed to do and if somebody had said no no no here's what you do could start a business that gets to this you sell for this multiple that whole thing might take you five to seven years maybe 10 years total and uh by the time you're 31 you might be there right like if somebody had sat me down I would have really felt like thankful and been like wow I don't have to go do that but I'm glad I know what I can I I'm glad I even know what that looks like because I didn't know that my parents didn't do that so they didn't teach me that that's not something they knew right like I saw this great quote you can't ask somebody for directions to a place that they never been and I guess like growing up I I was asking people for directions to a place that they had never been and so therefore they were just giving me all kinds of screwed up directions to places that I didn't want to go and so um yeah I guess like there's a long-winded way of saying I think when I looked at that class thing I guess like the the I went into it trying to feel good about myself but actually ended up feeling bad I was like man I feel like there was a lot of potential on the table and most people took basically safety and Prestige like they had a good job at a great company and I'd rather have no job at my company right that's that's the shift that I wish like you at least 25% of those people could have done that and been in a totally different position yeah I see so many people do this too with startups um where they they go you know my goal is Financial Freedom and then they go and start a venture back startup and it goes back to that roulette versus poker where it's like look if you just started a boring business like a trash hauling business or window cleaning business or whatever it is you get it to one or two million dollars of cash flow sell it or hold it you're set for life and instead they go off and they raise all this money and they don't realize that they really have a 1% you know call it a a one to 5% chance of success and maybe a 10% chance of like an okay outcome where they basically just make whatever they would have made over 10 years in a payout you know if they had just done that or something um I feel like so many people are trapped in that way of thinking and I think there's this other great book that really inspired me with mine which is called how to get rich as the best book I mean that's by far one of the best business books I've ever read Because I read part of it I read like a third of it the book I mean the real the real takeaways it's it's similar to my book in some ways right where it's like at the end of the day the money like ruined the money like ruined him right he became like Addicted to Money and he basically in it goes look all my life I wanted to be a poet and instead I got obsessed with money and addicted to drugs and I wish that I just quit at 35 he said uh he goes he goes I was a I was a punch drunk boxer but instead of boxing it was making money and I ended up spending $100 million on crack and [ __ ] cuz he actually became a he was a crack addict uh and he died uh with a partner and that was uh a prostitute like his his then girlfriend was a prostitute he met um but the book has like 10 or 15 chapters and each is a different lesson but the main take ways that he's a really wealthy guy and he keeps it real beautiful writing and he talks about how uh yeah he got he got drunk on it and he he talks about I mean this kind of thing we've been doing in this episode where we talk about the levels right what are all the different levels of wealth and what do they mean and I remember reading it when my net worth was like 500 Grand and he's saying oh you know if you want to be really if you might think like 50 million is a lot but that's actually nothing you know here's what you get at 250 million comfortably poor comfortably Rich the and and all the levels are quite you read that you get very humbled um are you looking up the levels right now yeah I'm he has two of them he has levels of non-liquid money and then he has levels of liquid money and so he says wealth measured in cash in hand or quickly realizable assets so kind of like liquid is assets and what he says is 100 to 400k that's the comfortably poor 400 to 1 million the comfortably off one to2 million the comfortably wealthy and then it goes the Lesser Rich the comfortably Rich the rich the seriously Rich that 70 to 100 milon what does Rich start at 100 to 200 the truly rich and then over 200 million the filthy and super rich yeah it's a it's a great chart that he made I love that chart yeah and by the way like I guess for what it's worth even though I just went on this rant about like how you can kind of reverse engineer Financial Independence I gotta disagree with one thing that you said Andrew to I think you you have I think am I characterizing this right I think you have a belief which is like you should kind of like focus on these increments it's like get to the 250k get a few million in the bank and then like start start then you start kind of finding your life's work as you as you go right you can decide how much money you really want get to get to your enough number and then figure out your life's work is that correct yeah but I think that if you overshoot that it causes a lot of stress right I had a meeting once I want to tell you guys about my company got acquired by twitch and twitch hires this new guy the guy who's currently the CEO of twitch this guy Dan Clancy and I go into Dan's office and he's my new boss and he's like all right yeah I want I want to do a one-on-one you're one he has like five direct reports on one of his direct reports and he's like uh you know I always with my I want to have a good relationship I want to understand where you're trying to go and then I can help you get there so like you know what's the dream for you you're you're like a l i was like a L7 at the time like you want to get to L8 like you know like the little ladder they create inside the company uh and I think L10 is like the CEO and there's no nine it's like some weird system where you get to eight then you either get to 10 or you don't get there going going clear in Scientology yeah exactly I think Bezos is a 12 or 13 or something like that and like that's the top level so he's like what's the what's the goal and I was like I in my head I was like do I tell this guy I don't really give a [ __ ] about being at this company or do I have to lie and pretend I want to be here when I'm really I'm just vesting out for like the next year I was like all right let's go with the truth so I go honestly like uh I did this deal that's how I got here uh that amount of money kind of matters to me I want to invest that out I want to have fun while I'm here I want to do good work while I'm here I want to meet cool people but honestly like not looking for a long-term fit here um you know there not a one night stand it's like a onee stand for for me and I tell him this and he said okay great he he doesn't Flinch and I'm like okay I respect this guy and he U he goes I don't want to waste my time then trying to figure out like you know your path here but he's like I also don't want to check out on you I was like oh thank you I was like that's my hesitation I didn't want to tell you that because I didn't want you to just totally write me off as like a guy you don't want to spend any time with for the next year because I'm not a part of the long term he's like no no no and he goes um so tell me what is the plan then outside of here and I go you know um and this is where I went to like this is how I used to think at the time I had this insecurity which made me want to say something very ambitious I thought you know I live in Silicon Valley and Sil you know in Hollywood you're measured on your your beauty and your IMDb in Silicon Valley it's how ambitious is your story what what are you trying to change and disrupt and all this stuff so I said I said I really want to start a school like a university so I go to this beach and I tell them this thing and I don't know if you guys have ever done this but you you have your material as an entrepreneur you're saying it to your employees your investors all the time you have these speeches and you kind of know the reaction that you get and if you always get like a nodding like oh wow that sounds great sounds really well thought through that's a great framework for that you start to get used to that so I give him my framework I say to do this you need three things you need skills you need capital and you need connections and what I'm doing right now is the next three years I'm building those three up I'm building my Capital by being here I'm building my skills by doing this I'm building my connections by you know doing this and that's what I need to do the thing I give them this whole speech and I'm so used to people being like oh that sounds really well thought through you know sounds great he's going to be like uh Mark wallberg in The Departed and being like Hawthorn like come on like get that that's literally what he did to me he goes n i don't buy all that and then he doesn't even tell me what I'm just like okay um well that's all I got so so what do you want me to say he goes I don't believe in the Deferred Life Plan he goes anytime I you he's he's like I'm older and wiser he's like you know I just if I ever hear somebody who wants to do something and then they give me a bunch of reasons why they're not just going and doing it right now it tends to be a bad decision to to not go do the thing you want to do he's like it's okay if you don't know what you want to do then sure you you go wander around you try to figure it out but if you know you're he's like you're an entrepreneur if somebody told you they wanted to start a business would you tell them first go to business school read these 10 books first then go start uh you know go go do a practice session doing this go hire a coach no you tell them like start the business and you'll figure it out as you go that's how you how you get good at business by doing business there is no real substitute to getting good at the thing besides doing the thing and he goes if you want to do that you should go do it I don't believe in the Deferred Life Plan and ever since he said that to me um you know there's something good about getting just like served like that just getting owned to your face and you're like huh thank you that was like a real gift that you gave me because you could have just like everybody else just nodded along and said all right sounds good good luck uh and instead he kind of shook me up a little bit and changed my frame on that and so that's the only one thing I would say Andrew is like you have this thing of like go figure out your life's work which is I don't know maybe a better plan is to like start by saying what do I really love doing or you loved designing websites designing products and you might have just been happy you're doing that you might have made as much money if you had just like gone for that versus I think the way that maybe you did things but definitely the way I did things which was first I'm gonna go make the money then I'm gonna do the things I want and actually as I look back now and if I was going to give advice to myself now I would say I don't think you need to do it that way that works that is one way way to work to make it work but you might be better off just going and trying to do the thing if you know what the thing is you know do you know that Parable the the fisherman and the businessman you know that one yeah love that one so good tell so okay so uh there's this like you know Wall Street guy and he's on vacation on a small tropical island and he sees this man who's fishing down by the water and he walks up and he says hey what are you up to and he says I'm fishing um for the morning and I'm G to get a fish and I'm GNA feed my family and the guy goes oh will you ever think about turning that into a business and he goes well how how would that work and he says well first you get a couple other buddies and you fish more you get more fish and then you sell them at the market well and then what well and then you would uh buy a boat and you'd be even more efficient and you could freeze them and you could ship them all over the world you have a great business and then he goes well then what and he says well you then get a fleet of ships well and then what after that well and then you take the company public and then what well and then you could retire and you could just fish all day and so the joke is like the guy is already doing the thing he loves why would he go and build this big business and I think it's like look do you want to chop wood in your backyard or do you want to own a sawmill do you want to be jro from jro Dreams of Sushi or Steve ell's from Chipotle I think that is the ultimate question of like what is your happy place and how can you optimize your life around being in that um yeah I mean I remember one time I told that story and I was like wait what's the punch line you remember that Sean I was I told I'm like I'm not really sure what the takeway is but uh I'm like should I go and uh like fish or I don't know you remember that uh no it's a good story though but um Andrew when um when's the book officially come out July 9th it's actually a great book like I have a lot of friends that have come out with books and never enough is actually one that I sat down and read the entire thing not because I was trying to be your friend but because I thought it was awesome the writing's good what are you looking at Sean I'm looking at the book well I had the same reaction I would have said it's a good book anyways cuz I'm your friend but it actually is a good book I read it in like three nights basically I read on when it was still a PDF there's three there's three good stories I remember from Andrew so there's the the Charlie Monger story so it's basically the uh the crazy way that you actually ended up meeting your hero and kind of almost doing a business deal with him there's the pixel Union sale and then buyback story I thought that was a great one of kind of like your first big win in terms of an exit and you shared the numbers and you talked about how it went down and then like how it went slightly wrong I like that story um and then the last one I won't I won't give away the ending but the ending is dope and uh the ending was so good I was like did he just do this for the book like I was like did he just make this ending so like he needed a good ending for the book so he just did this thing in real life or was that real but it it was it was a very good way to end the book I liked it it all it was all real um dude thanks for doing this again and uh Never Enough what's the best place to buy it a website or Amazon does it matter yeah just go to never never enough.com there's all the link there or you can just go on Amazon and buy it there and that's the pod [Music]

Kevin the interesting thing about you is like you've got this massive newsletter business it's all about farming and agriculture yeah we're proba the 30 to 40,000 range on F subscribers wait did you say like 30,000 subscribers at $600 a year you got to tell me everything what about the other Tech so like I've seen people do these like Fitbit for cows yeah we think that that's going to be prevalent throughout we think you're going to blockchain the farm is what we'll call it in our world what are the things you're excited about now where do you think the Unity is I [Music] think all right Kevin what's going on man we're here so I have I have got to do a quick story on how we met so about four years ago I think we're in Scottdale Arizona at the design pickle conference I just get done doing this talk about how the hustle is like doing pretty good we're at a million subscribers whatever at the end of the talk I just walk backstage or I walk in the back of the crowd you're wearing Ramon's t-shirt and like shorts and you walk up to me and you're like hey nice little talk you did there and I was like oh thank you and you've got this you got this confidence about you and you're like so how many subscribers do you have uh and I was like uh I think a million or something like that and and you go well you know that's pretty nice I got a little newsletter myself uh we're doing okay we got about 30,000 subscribers and I was like oh that's that's a good start and you said well how much do you charge people to read the hustle and I'm like it's free uh I make money via advertising and you're like oh you don't charge and I was like you do and uh you go yeah we charge about $600 and I it takes about 10 seconds and I'm like doing the math and I'm like wait did you say 30,000 subscribers at $600 a year and you're like yeah what do you expect and turns out you've got this massive newsletter business and I was like what's the newsletter about and you're like oh we talked to uh Farmers it's all about farming and Agriculture and I'm like wait hold on man you've got to tell me everything here and that's what my mind was blown and I was like we got to get you on and it took about four years but finally we made it happen I appreciate it Sean what did you think when you met the van trumps and got got around his people man I would just call it a series of amazement and confusion I showed up and first of all it's called Farm con so I think the conference is going to be a bunch of farmers by the way at this point in my life I don't think I'd ever met a farmer uh I I had grown up you know overseas I lived I live on the coast I had never really met a farmer so I thought it's going to be about farming and and and whatnot and um instead it's actually about investing so that was the first part that I was amazing confused about was I walk in and it's a talk going on about options trading corn Futures and and it was so far over my head and I was like Wow wait these guys are actually talking about crazy Wall Street stuff what what's going on here and then over time I met a bunch of people the conference was amazing and they were like well what are you doing here and I was like I don't know I got I don't farm and I don't trade Commodities so I'm not really sure but I'm here to talk uh I have a talk schedule tomorrow and I'm here to just be out of my comfort zone be out of my bubble because I had only been going to Tech conferences when I was doing my research for this pod I learned that you actually kind of did a similar thing which was that there was a period of your life where you wanted to shake things up and you started just going to different conferences or trade shows that were totally unrelated to what you were doing and what you were familiar with you kind of intentionally put yourself in to just shake up your worldview is that right can you talk a little bit about that yeah for sure that's how I meant say I mean we were at this I don't even know what the hell it was my son had called and said let's just make it where we make ourselves go to different things make ourselves uncomfortable get out of our comfort zone he called me and said hey there's this conference in Phoenix mom wanted to go to Phoenix and out there and I said what is it he said design pickle I said what the hell are we they had people speaking out we're doing like hair you know they were at a hair drying business and they had all kinds of crazy stuff I said okay I'll go [ __ ] next thing I find myself walking around the courtyard of this place holding another guy's hand like you know [ __ ] I never do here in the Midwest like mean hell is going on you know they had us doing some weird stuff and uh and yeah and that's where I at Sam and so yeah each year we try to go to different things just to get different perspective different views you know we just believe in in trading and investing it's all about perspective and you know you can get blindsided a million different ways and so I like to be around the younger people to help broaden my perspective because you know we always say in our business it's the old bear and the young bull as we get older we tend to get more bearish just because we don't we don't understand as much as we did when we were younger you know when we were younger we were aggressive and we knew the latest greatest things and now that we get older most of my older hedge fund friends and Traders were more cynical embarass just by Nature it seems like because we just don't understand a lot of the newer stuff so well I'll give you two things that came out of it number one after farmcon me and Ben at in the lobby of the hotel while one of the talks was going on it was another corn futurist talk that was going over my head I said hey let's just hang out in the lobby real quick I just got to get out of here I don't I don't understand what the hell these guys are talking about anyways so we go to the lobby and we had talked to you about your newsletter business and we go you know what we should create a newsletter business around what we're what we're interested in and we were very interested in crypto at the time we had been kicking around this idea but we hadn't really had the momentum the energy to just like create it from scratch to birth that baby and so only in the lobby of the hotel where we like let's do this and we named it milk road which was kind of like a farmy sort of name anyways it all came together in the L and then a year later we sold that business for millions of dollars and so I I got to credit you in a way because we had had a conversation with you the night before and you told us you're like hey guys I got to go back to my room I gotta write the newsletter and we were like you still write the newsletter like surely you've hired a team of people you're like no I I write the newsletter myself um I've written it I think you had written it for like some absurd number like 18 straight years or 20 straight years you hadn't missed it and it was you writing it every single day is that right I have a a girl East word for we can't state bo trade Stacy C she's out in LA and uh she helps me with a lot of content a lot of thing I write corn beans wheed I write the uptp comment she she helps with those and then I write the stories down below so it's her and I usually tag teaming the whole thing to to give her credit and she's been she's been awesome let's explain though a little bit so your main thing is the Van Trump report so Van Trump report.com it's a daily newsletter that is it's a great read I actually have read it for a while and it's talks about I call it for Farmers but it's way beyond that so it's agricultural based information but for Farmers but also for people who are trading Commodities and you have said that uh politicians read it to understand a little bit about what's going on in that world and you've told me I don't remember exactly what you said you told me that it was doing something like 30,000 people paying something like $600 a year and it's basically just you writing it which if you did that math that's true that's like $18 million a year in revenue from a newsletter is that right yeah it's just myself uh there's about four of us on our staff here A friend of mine that used to be a golf pro uh buddy that I went to school with Stacy out in California and my son Jordan on this side of the fence my wife does uh bookkeeping with accounting team but that's really it and like you said yeah I did the newsletter and just you know wanted to write about what I was interested in and and everything that kind of interested me and so you know that's that's really what we do and what we put out yeah we've got several Congressman Senators a lot of big trading groups hedge fund people and yeah about 35 we're probably into 30 to 40,000 range on on F subscribers it's also got like five pages of memes in it which I love because I was like I would read it and the first part was cool is commentary on where you think the Market's headed and it's written the way you talk it's very informal it's it's a straight shooter type of Vibe which makes it fun to read even if it's not your stick and then it's got a bunch of memes which made me laugh and I was like this is hilarious that that you chose to do that was the product we see today is that basically how you started it is that what it was at the beginning and how did you get it off the ground what was the how did you get the initial momentum with that yeah pretty much so I my marry my high school sweetheart we were both from a small rural town here in Missouri I go to work for a group that was contract with the NFL Do cams combines clinic so I'm traveling all around the country got a really cool job making no money my wife kind of lands her dream job in Chicago and you know we didn't come from any money neither one of our parents or anything we didn't have any money really so to speak when we were younger so my wife gets this job she was going to run the Eddie Bower out on Michigan Avenue they was going to be their Premier store and all this so we thought man this is going to be great you know we go up there and I didn't know anything and some of my friends in the NFL are like you got to get in the trading business [ __ ] I didn't know anything about trading and I said I a small real toown farm kid played last Sports all my life and they said well we'll give you this interview I go get an interview of this guy and the guy just kind of looks at me he's like damn you're a big tall guy and I I was probably about 64 350 at the time and they're like you you like the fight and I'm what the hell kind of interview question is it you know I'm like what and I said yeah sure [ __ ] I go out every weekend you know get a rumble or two at the bars they're like yeah you're great we you're high and I said what am I doing I don't even know what the hell I'm doing they're like oh everybody will see you on the floor it'll give us a little Edge and Advantage so you know I started the very bottom they wanted me to be a phone clerk you know and then moved where as in for getting orders off so I meet a few people they start me off I go over and I'm trading Swiss Franks demarks and foreign currencies over at the Merc and then I flip back over to the board I was trading treasuries so wait Kevin this was back when you used to have to kind of push and shove your way with the with the papers getting your trade off and they were like your size was actually an asset yeah dig time the you know they'd hire a basketball guys X football guy there' be fights break out all the time on the floor so all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hous we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and a resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show then we got off the floor where we were arban Min uh e- minis first came out we were arban minis against bigger S smps and then really my strong suit became really uh more people got interested in graines corn because they started using corn as ethanol and things like that so a lot of our big Traders and friends they didn't know anything about the Midwest you know and so it was all just foreign language to them so they would keep asking me questions and then I would go back home to my small rural town where the farmers were playing dominoes in the morning you know up at getting breakfast or caught and you know they'd be like hey City Slicker you know tell us what's happening here in the corn Bean or wheat Market or cattle market and I would do like you said Sean I would just Dum it down to my you know my back home speaking in more of a blue collar and just tell them hey here's they're really meaning or saying and so in ' 07 I just was before that a little bit when the government came out with the RFS that's where they turned Cor in death andol I started writing a newsletter kind of just for myself a journal i' said hey I'm going to be a better Trader and better investor I've listened to a lot of people uh I've been broke twice on a couple of deals and it's like let's do it the right way so I started journaling and I said hey I'm going to send my notes out to friends and then it started circulating back to me it was coming from guys at Goldman and different trading firms it was circling back to me and I told my wife I said [ __ ] we were investing trying to do some um storage units at the time so I thought he I'll send it out for 40 bucks a month it'll be like a storage unit deal let's just see if people buy or pay and it just kind of took off and went nuts from there and we've never advertised and we're about 45 countries now and all the growth was organic then oh yeah we've never advertised one time I love it and then you have the conference the thing that I went into I think it was originally called the Van Trump conference you renamed it to farm con and for those who don't know you are like a god at this thing it was really inspiring to see because you weren't trying to be uh you know the the front center of it but you could just tell you had so much respect from the community people really appreciated this Gathering because they were getting a lot of value out of it and you ran it like a family affair and you got your son there and he's got his swag business and so how did the farm con thing come about and is that like a big part of the business why do you do it yeah you know it kinded well it started off just myself and probably 30 or 40 friends Traders investors we' get together once a year drink some beers and tell each other what our favorite trades or favorite Investments were and they loved coming to Kansas City because it was kind of an anomaly you know where you used to being on the coast in New York or California so they'd come here and it would be kind of fun and so they would start to invite their friends and we all had investments in land uh bigger land Investments and different next thing they had a lot of hunting and fishing guys were coming and just people that own big farms they were flying their private planes in and so yeah then we just kind of blew up and they started telling more and more of their friends and H next thing we started selling out most everywhere we AB of that you know it's it's really cool you know fun time can we talk a little bit about kind of like your Empire and what it is now so you've got the publishing business the newsletter and then you have this thing called a swag which is a merch company is that right yeah look back up to to be clear you know some of the people grandfathered in we started charging $40 left 400 a year or 40 bucks left then we went about eight years ago to 660 and we have some people that white label to report and send it to their uh their businesses and their staff and things like that so that's all in the mix but yeah so I had a friend uh Dave Crum holds he recently passed away he was a CEO of pay lless cashways and Dave came back here to Kansas City he started a business consulting company and then he got hired uh at a place called American identity and I said Dave what the hell are you doing coming American identity I said don't they just sell like hats and chachki stuff and he's like yeah private Equity company bought them and they're going to dress it up they want to have a you know big executive team so they're bringing me in as a CEO and he's like I think we'll have a good exit well about three I think it was three or four years they sold to Staples I believe it was undisclosed but I think it was close to $8 billion they sold the Staples and I said holy [ __ ] I said who what what you guys do over there in American identity and he said you know made hats shirts and Chachi said I said well who the hell are your biggest clients and he's like John Deere ADM Cargill I'm like oh [ __ ] I said I know all those people I know all the you know all the farming a people and uh he says well I tell you you know if you ever get where you guys are GNA start something or want something just under the radar non- intrusive business you know this this would be a great way to get something roll so I told my son Jordan when he got out of college or he's about out I said hey if you ever if you want toy some on your own I got an idea I said I've come up with a name a swag and I said you know we could probably spin this off and take care of a lot of our clients and just provide a lot better service and and be a lot you know more fun and friendly and and give people some great fresh ideas and so we launched a swag and it's you know just a swag company that provides hats things of that nature to people really specifically in the a world we do other things but that's really our Jordan spte now he's running that he's hired an art team he's got about four or five artists uh my daughter came back to help him he's got you know team of logistics people and I think they're going to do he said somewhere between 25 and 30 million this year so you know they're they're growing like crazy and you know every day if we wanted pull slly I can walk you guys through a little bit of the business yeah let's do it you know this is just a simple example you draw you know you have your your scale of uniqueness on the left and your scale of total value on the right and so if you go to your far right you have high value and low uniqueness right and you're asking what the hell would that be and that's like a tire business I always use an example like you know people have to have it so it's not unique but there's high value because everyone you nobody want to kill their family and any damn tires on their car so they want it to be good that if you see your business in that aspect you know you're in a low gross business model mean you're going to have to be a a lowcost provider you're going to have to do volume and you know that's going to be your play if you get up into the upper right quadrant and this keeps me out of a lot of bad business deals here you have low value but High uniqueness um you know you start to ask yourself what you know what is that remember when snap or Google came out with the glasses those glasses or I was one back in my day like a laser disc you know you know you you're going to be cost a lot of money to educate the masses it's going to cost a lot to get it to Market and there might not be any longevity in it so you got to be careful in you know not a lot of value but High uniqueness that's a tough spot to play in now you get over to where Apple likes to play or some of the others you go high value High uniqueness that's something like an iPod 10,000 songs in your pocket you know that was their main stick and it's like that's where you can create high gross that's where you can create high margin and that's where you can make a lot of great things happen obviously lower left corner you're you're an idiot if you're somewhere in no value no so you know and I always say there people by value not price and this was a hard one to understand for a lot of people because if I went into uh Walmart and I put a whole bin of laser disc in there and I put them for sale for 5 cents I mean b yeah nobody's going to buy them just because there's no value to you know what I'm saying now maybe there is a little now because people are looking to sell some of those types of it but I'm just saying you have to be aware people buy price people buy value not price and so you make the price as low as you want to go it was just not good it's not good and I see people get trapped in that a lot in real estate and some other things so you know this is where we try to we try to categorize the business deals when they come down the pipe where this is at and how this is going to play out because it's never the soldiers I send in at first right it's never the first money we send in on the deal it's how many more soldiers are going to get called into duty and uh and maybe never come back home into my bank account or come back you know missing Limbs and arms and so it's like you have to be careful I think in that aspect you know it's it's that because I'm my wife all the time's like my gosh we're writing more Capital call check but we kind of know when if we can categorize in this way we know what we're getting into where we went with a swag what's critically important we believe is knowing your funnel so your light users there's obviously you're going to be able to get more market share on your light users As you move down the customer continue that would be your heavy user so as Sean pointed out that would be John deal or that would be a cargo now we what you have to understand in all businesses you're always going to be pulled to the right so you're always going to be pulled to the high user and low gross they're going to try to get you over there if if people like what you have they like what you're doing they're going to take you over there more to the right and you know try to beat you up on your price try to beat you up on Gross because they say they're heavy used that's why it's really imperative for most people you don't want to get an order from wall you know you don't want to to go that way because it's next to impossible to get your business back to the left and to the left is where you're going to see a lot more profitability a lot more high grow and and so we tried to position awag in the middle away from the John deers and ADM so we've had calls from them wanting their play is for us to you know store all of their merch for the year we ship it out it becomes a logistics business the gross shrinks up to nothing and we've got a you know a real you know you know we're running a real people business business then where we've got a lot of hands and a lot of touches so we tried to stay out of that space as much as possible early on so we can create and build more smaller accounts smaller business owners and people like that where there's more fragmentation for us so you have these other slides that I really like so you had this uh this poker versus chess one that I loved um can you can you talk about this one yeah you know I just think you know they talk a lot about life being like chess or a lot of times you'll hear people talk about those things you know um you know I say lies more like poker than chess just because the cards are face down and a lot of Lu's involved a lot of times so you know he can be the greatest had the greatest skill in the world and I've met some the most brilliant brilliant people but if they don't catch any breaks they don't catch any luck and you know it becomes tough so I think you have to remind yourself and that's what we were kind of talking about earlier if you think you're a genius and you're you're just smarter than everyone else I think you run into a ton of problems and a ton of Roadblock that's where I think you know you have to look at it more like poker like you're going to catch you're going get lucky every now and then and get on a run and get on low heater and and sometimes you know that's when you really have to to push and go all in is is when when your when your Luck's going your way when when you feel like you some of the things are going your way you got to pull way back you know that's not when you double and triple down that's when you kind of hunker down it but the storm clouds pass and then hopefully your luck will shift and turn around a little bit well it seems like there's three three parts to the poker thing right there's the cards are are face down so there's a lot of unknowns unlike chess then you're talking about luck and variance that's the second bar but then the third part was you said that the the amateur players just play too many hands a pro only plays you know 15 to 20% of their hands but an amateur is playing half the hands and so the trick is actually just to pass on the average opportunity to save room for the huge opportunity that's that's the other one and I think Warren Buffett calls this waiting for the fat pitch he's like there's no called strikes you can let 50 opportunities go by and just pass on them even if there were some good ones in there it's okay as long as you just when you do swing you swing at the right ones 100% I I 100% agree I mean you know we use that analogy we use the Ted Williams thing all the time there's Ted Williams has a batting chart and Ted Williams was one of the first persons to go and document all of his where he would hit balls and where he could you know what his percentage was if it was high in outside low in inside and he figured out where his sweet spot was and and Williams would just sit and Wai for his [ __ ] and when he got it he knock [ __ ] out it so it's similar to what yourself you talk about uh luck and you say passing on the average opportunity to save room for the huge opportunity and with your trading uh what have been opportunities that you've thought were huge that you pounced on as well as maybe some that you didn't because you thought they were average yeah tons I could go through those like crazy and uh you know but I I agree with that and we've we've talked about this myself and a lot of my trading friends it's that as we've gotten older we've we've learned we can look back through all of our document tag dos and everything I mean the more trades we made the worse year we had it seemed like the fewer trades by far the better of the year and you know now we're trading even less and less and less and I know I think some of our readers kind of probably get SC they want the action and everything but you know it's like wrestling you know as a great wrestler a high school college wrestler they're super patient they wait for the the market in this case to make a mistake wait for the market to get out of out of aligned or overleveraged or over tilted and then you come in and you try to make a play uh you know most all your money is made the greatest Traders will say all your money's made sitting you know sitting and waiting and and it's incredibly hard to do the decision to do nothing is a decision and in our world a lot of times it can be the best decision you could possibly make so you know and as far as like Sam saying you know we like I said we were early with Bitcoin we were early with Tesla I was trading when Amazon first came out and we had 30,000 shares of Amazon like right out of the hole and I went negative on it I never forget story my wife and I [ __ ] we didn't enough money to pay attention at the time and we were sitting there they I had this position on it went against me and I said man if this thing just gets back to even and Amazon tra like three or four bucks a time it got back to even and I'm blew out and I mean it would have been like you know the craziest trade of all times if IID have stuck with it but I wouldn't have stuck with it probably you know I'm a Trader so it's like you can't you can't beat yourself up saying man if I would have just stayed in that or not stuck with it and I think a lot of people do that to themselves you know it's a psychological game and you just want to try not to beat yourself up and not get down on yourself because that then it then it gets hard to fail and recover so what's the case for being a Trader versus a investor because if you read about all the investing greats they all kind of poo poo Traders a little bit they're like oh you don't want to be a Trader you want to be uh you know a Buy and Hold guy you want to buy find a great asset and then sit on it for a long time am I just only reading the advice from the investors and that's why or is there something to what they're saying no you're absolutely right I mean there's plenty of Trades I've been in that I've become an investor because they went against me and we just kept holding and holding and holding right it was meant to be a short-term trade but turned into a long-term uh you know just ass kicking so it's like no I agree my job though I was a Trader so you know I was at the floor I was at the exchange as at Kansas City Board trade guy you know and so my whole job revolved around trading and fairly quick movements in the market I was never I did own a day trading firm at one time uh and you should have seen you know the success rate on people day trading just a miserable business so we don't day trade so to speak we'll be more swing trading we'll be multi-days in a trade you know the commodity markets are a little different for every buyer there's a loser and they're a little different than stocks and and there's expirations on the contract so you know we're we're more short-term oriented but we're also longer term investors like you would say Sean I do think I advise my kids my own kids exactly what you're saying you know no unless you're going to be full-time and you really want the belly AES I wouldn't advise probably you know trading or trying to time Market movements uh like said I I'm more with Buffett you know I I think you know everybody's trying to beat the indexes I mean everybody's trying to beat theb or than Nas second and year in and year out that's tough to do and you know so I think you know as a passive investor long-term hold is probably a good play for for the majority of most people and that's the way to build wealth how many years have you beat the index how how long you been doing this 20 or 30 years how do you think that you've beat the index you know I mean the years that we beat it need to buy a mile because we'll get lucky in some certain position or some certain stock and year like this year I'm I'm trailing I have decent amount put over into uh you know we're stilling a lot of CDs at five and a quarter or 5% and you know a lot of our wealth building has come from Real Estate that's just buying land farm land or what are you buying buying real estate you know we have everything from commercial properties to single families that we've turned into various airbnbs uh yeah land farm land regular land and those have been our biggest winners has the majority of your net worth come from the income that the newsletter has produced or has it been from Trading so I think there's two ways you can do it with your business you know when you're breing money you can either take the money and reinvest it back in your business which we didn't do that was kind of my play I'm like I'm not going to do that I'm going to take my money and then I'm going to put it out and see and try and invest in other people's businesses and you know and we've we're we're partners with a firm private firm called iselect so we are early investors in agtech startups and some biotech and so we've had a ton of losers but they've all led to meeting new people uh learning new things and then that in turn comes to something else that so you know we try to grow our revenue and then take that revenue and invest it in various other vehicles and other sources what's the uh like sentiment like amongst the people that are reading the newsletter or would come to the conference you know are people bullish right now are they optimistic are there big headwinds or Tailwinds what's going on in the food producer world yeah you know it's it's pretty dark right now over in our world so so to speak the the big jumping rates was obviously a kind of a real pinch for a lot of our AG Tech startups and a lot of the people just in agriculture in general so you've had a big jumping rates and then we also have you know a little bit of glutch right now we have a pretty burdensome supply of core over two billion bual supply of core you know we got about 500 million bushel supply of beans coming down the pipe and sorry that that means that last season overproduced yeah you know we had a good year last year uh South America's coming off a pretty good year Argentine like for example Argentine production doubled from what they had they had a big drought last year had some production problems Brazil's got a little bit they're down from a little bit but China like so China right now hasn't been a buyer of us new CR beans haven't booked any any caros which is unusual so we're worried we got this election coming up anything can happen we're not sure how China is going to play it with Trump coming back into the mix are we going to have a bigger hit on tariff so when Trump was in office we had bean prices go break pretty considerably because we got into a pissing match with China and you know they're the number one buyer of beans in the world so it's we're kind of trying to weigh this thing out here and see how things are going to shake out but we do have some new things on the front we got sustainable aviation fuel so soybeans are now going to be used to make sustainable aviation fuel which is going to be a big bigin were're trying to push to get corn to where the corn production is going to also be used to make sustainable aviation fuel there's a few pipeline issues that need to be addressed and some things like that but we're moving for more food for fuel is becoming more a little more prevalent so we're seeing more countries move to that for cleaner energy sources so we're seeing more utilities and more usage for traditional crops and we're seeing more utility and more usage for land we were just seeing a ton more buyers and biders come in for land people wanting to put in solar you know solar Fields uh to create energy wind Fields uh there's just a lot more utilities being used now for data centers we're seeing a big push through the Midwest on companies wanting to build these massive data centers uh really through the glut of the Midwest and we think it's kind of like Cushings Oklahoma where we store our oil now we think data is going to be kind of the new oil and so we're going to try and store our data here in the US Cally into the Midwest so we're seeing a big push in some Farm ground being gobbled up for Big Data Center my father is a a produce broker so he owns a small brokerage where like let's say that over the course of 20 years he's sold aund Million doar worth of onions you know over the course of 20 years the the the margin is like 5% like so he he'll he'll make $5 million over 20 years or whatever if you sell h100 million do wor of onion so it's a huge quantity but in that space he's a small dog you know really tiny but I remember during during 08 like I remember I was only uh 17 or 18 I was watching the news and I was like you know Dad why are do you seem like you're making more money now than than before where everyone else seems to be going broke and he was like well look at the corner of our kitchen there's onions and potatoes there like people are still going to buy this stuff no matter what and then when the economy is going well like you're going to go out to eat and I'll crush it then too so it's like I'm I'm in a good business and I remember thinking like as I got older I kind of forgot about farming and I forgot about food and Agriculture and I just I didn't really think about it but what I've learned is that over the years that America is really good at two or three things one of them being culture so we export culture like amazingly well so Hollywood is like our biggest export I would say or or culture the second thing that we do really well we are so [ __ ] good at growing corn America is so good at growing corn and I forget how important agriculture is to our to our our way of life in in America so when you're talking about some of these things about what China's doing what Brazil is doing if China's buying stuff from us how big is like this entire industry that you're assoc I mean what percentage of the GD GDP or economic value is it creating in America compared to other things oh massive I mean it's you know one of the and we're seeing more and more of the wealthy get into Agriculture and that's why I'm saying it's a really hot area and you're seeing you know the Gates Foundation Buffett's group uh well War Sun son Howard he used to be a big farmer uh and he had just recently gotten out and uh still own the ground but there having to other people farming and do some things like that but yeah seeing a big big push in more and more people being interested in egg and interested in food and where it's coming from we're seeing Sean we're also see is more people going direct to the farmers now uh just recently in the last few weeks we've seen more ranches come online kind of form a little Coalition there's a group of about seven eight good ranches down in Texas that are now selling direct to the public you know they were getting Maybe they were getting minimal for their beef uh you know and now that they're selling direct they're they're really doing well and people like buying direct and so did you just buy off their website or or there there's some startup that's doing this yeah they have auxes I think it's called bid for beef I thought that was a dating site yeah yeah you know so yeah it could be whatever you're into yeah but you know they're starting to make more traction and we're seeing that across the board with other plays what's going on with like Farms that are kids don't want to take it over what does the succession plan look like and and is somebody solving that problem that's a huge issue and that's being discussed heavily and in the a world that uh you know so you have this this big succession rollover I think I don't know what the number I can't remember off top of my head it's okay 80% of the Farms are owned by people over 60 you know it's it's a really aging demographic and a lot of the the kids you know or have other jobs or went off to Great colleges and great schools and they don't necessarily want to come back so yes there is there is a a big issue and and a lot of the people in the farming World keep their cards really close to their chest and they don't really talk a lot openly with their kids or they don't have a lot of great succession planning in place and and we're seeing that a lot I think uh you know we've tried to be super open with our kids and and discuss everything and show them everything and say hey here's where everything's at here's where you need to know here's where you need to be and uh you know Hally you know we tell our other friends to to similar type things so yeah secession planning is is very important and I think it's you know something that we all have to address as we own businesses so what what do you think's going to happen like uh if if 80% of these are owned by people over 60 and a lot of the kids are going like is this just going to be private Equity owns all the Farms like what what what happens here we are going to see a lot of rollover a lot of turnover so in the farming space or when you're buying acle there's there's two bids that are going to come against you the person whose Farm butts up against you they're going to be willing to pay a big premium because the land may only come available once in their lifetime and so going to be bidden heavily so whoever's in close proximity because as you know driving the combines or driving the hard it it makes a lot of sense to get a continuing piece of ground and now you're also having like California teachers pension fund bidden against you you have other high profile uh fun people bidding against you so yes who runs it they just place somebody to go live on the farm and run it Sean have you ever been on a farm no I don't know where I would go to find a farm where do you they on a map somewhere my uh my aunts and uncles and cousins are farmers in Oklahoma and they have like two or three thousand acres and they are I guess they're ranchers and so they own like, 1500 cattle I believe and a bunch of their cattle are uh Sean you probably never heard this term they're buckin bows have you ever heard of you know what a bucking bowl is I do not so what they do is they uh the PBR which is the professional Rodeo Association they if you get a good bowl a good Bowl can be worth I don't know Kevin what like 50 Grand all the way up to a million dollars and oh yeah more than that some of and these good Bulls you get you make money in two ways you make money because at the rodeo the rider gets paid so if you stay on a a bull for a certain amount of time you win and you get paid but the bull that bucks the hardest also gets paid and that's like a like a ra rating system and so there's like famous bulls that are known as like really hard bucking bulls who's the Michael Jordan of bulls it's bushwhacker I want bushwhacker Bushwacker has been the best for a long time Bushwacker is a famous bull uh the guy who uh like dominated Bushwacker what's his name Jr or something he like just retired I believe right what was that guy we've my son played football with a couple kids that were PBR bull riders you know my cousin and this family this is what they do and so I went and stay with them every once in a while and we get up at like 8 and starting at like 10: you go to the feed store and you buy a huge amount of feed you bring the feed back you call the blls and you throw it all over like the like you scatter it out throughout the the the area and they come up and they eat it and then on the weekends they drive these bowls from Oklahoma to Texas which is like 12 hours and these bowls when you put them into the truck you would think a bowl that you birthed and rais like they will literally be there when they birth this bull but once the bull hits puberty I guess or it has balls it wants to [ __ ] kill you no matter what it doesn't matter if you raise or birth this bull this bull wants to murder you every chance it's gets and so just to get the bull onto the truck it's like a life or death situation every once in a while like this it's a 1500 pound thing that that you got to get into this truck and they would drive these balls all around the country and they get paid I think four grand just to as an appearance fee or something like that to show up PBR and then the other the cows the the females and so they make their money by raising the cows that they sell for beef and then the Bulls they either sell them to get bread or they make money directly from the rodeo and it's like a huge cash business so my cousins and aunts and uncles they'll always have a a w of cash because they'll go to the auction and it's just like a really heavy cash business they get let's say 10 grand for selling 10 10 cows they take that 10 grand and they spend eight of it like that day on more cow feed and so it's like a really heavy I'm probably getting some numbers wrong but there it's a really heavy cash business and it's [ __ ] hard my cousin Sam would drive around and he'd be drinking like natural light while he's driving his truck checking on all the like on all the cows dude it's a it's a hard living and it's really fun I've like spent time on there it's been it's fun for me as a visitor but it is a hard job to do this [ __ ] you are working and walking constantly yeah you're right and you know I lost I lost a good choke of not a big choke but I did what you said some buddies mine K and said hey let's start raising these Bulls to be PBR bulls you know rodeo bulls [ __ ] I I don't think I ever cashed one check I think it was a lot of fun a lot of like you said a lot of drinking Natty light and driving around the pickup checking on him and you know yeah like it's like fun but it is [ __ ] hard and it it's a very Capital intensive business hey I'll give you one I'll give you one that that was a big Miss now a guy came to me Sam we g a kick out guy came to me that was probably 20 years ago and uh 50 you know the internet was just getting going he said man I got this great idea and the guy came in and he was all suited up and I said well he's an English major and all that he says what I'm going to do is I'm going to build his websites and I'm going to hire a couple other English majors and we're going to write really eloquent descriptions of these cattle and these bulls and their stems the stem they call the sperm you know and he's like then I'm going to sell this sperm all over in Japan all over the world I said dude you're nuts this [ __ ] ain't gonna work you know this was early on D blew it up he blew it up what how do you eloquently describe the sperm of a ball what's it what's his website you know the background the lineage I don't know I have not soled him for number year but I remember he came back through and some people were like man this guy just hey I'll tell you one we were at the Louisville Farm Show they had me come down there to speak Us's world largest indoor farmer show and so I go down there be the keynote speaker and there's this little boost setting up next to us they got these coloroids on this little 10 by10 booth tent and I go over talk I said what the hell is this thing he's like it's called farmersonly.com and you guys have seen all of the ad man I'm not shitty Sean we're like all making fun of him and then the next year he comes and he has like a 20 by 20 booth and then the next year he's there and [ __ ] his Booth damn near big as John Deere I mean his Booth is massive and we're like the hell then he's got Super Bowl ads just.com you're looking to marry a farmer you know that thing just blew up and he [ __ ] he turned that into a great deal so when you uh so let's say I wanted to become a gentleman farmer I wanted to go buy a farm walk me through that so first where would I find a farm uh do is this like sold like on Zillow or is this U Brokers only how do people find Farms buy you know some people are now investing fractally through I'm in I'm invested in the company ACR Trader ACR trader.com so we buy Farms we even have Farms out in your neck of the woods Sean um out in we have nut farms uh out in California uh we have regular uh other Road Crop Production Farms through Bakersfield and that area through there um you know and all over the United States you have various farms grow very super products a farmer is selling a fraction of their of their Farm what happs at acre trade we go in and actually buy the entire farm from a family say they're W out or the session planning and they want to leave so we'll buy the entire farm and most of the time we'll have a farmer in that area that has called us about the farm and said hey we don't have the money but if you guys would want to put up the money we'd be happy to farm it for you and do Revenue sharing crop sharing or some type of uh you know split into the revenue we're looking to just hold the ground for appreciation over 10 12 year period the years you have good years you have some really good years some years though you you're going to have some some losing years but over the course of time 10 15 20 years your appreciation on the land's going to be that's really going to carry you forward and that's what the that's what a lot of hedge funds are looking for a lot of funds are looking for that longer term appreciation well what what do these trade for like if I go buy a farm what is the multiple you pay on a farm typically or would it be just price per acre price per acre and it's gone nuts lately I mean my buddy just sold his mom left him with chunk of ground that they had in their family and he said hey what do you think and I said I don't man it's a great time this was about 7 eight months ago I said you know farmers are flush with some cash maybe it about a year ago and he end up getting 20,000 an acre down here outside of Missouri now that's pretty rare off the books you know acreage around here typically go from you five to 12 to 15 but if someone needs the ground or wants the ground and it's a continuing piece of track to their Farm you can see guys get the bidd war and so you get bidding wars and yeah you can go out anywhere look up Farm ground you want to you know there's a lot of things you want to look for like in Kansas you can't drill any Wells any you can't drill new wells and so Kansas and Nebraska there's a lot going on with the underground aquifer and there's a lot of problems with with water using and so you know we we believe though we like C andb gr ground we like ground that's maybe in a flood plane or we like ground that's water deficient because we believe that all the technology and the money from Gates Foundation or Buffett they're they're really putting their money into new technology they'll help grow crops in third world countries that have really poor soil so you know Iowa has the best soil Iowa and Illinois they'll argue with each other who's got the richest soil and they've got great soil and great farms that you really don't have to do a lot to uh you get to some of these peripheral areas though be like these guys you get a biker jacket but you got no bike right that's that's more of my my My Lan so I just need to know I'm asking questions just so I have the lingo in case I ever get pressed so that I I can sound like I know what I'm talking about without actually knowing anything you uh you have to get some land to match that car heart coat that you want to get I I get that well what about the other Tech so like I've seen people do these like Fitbit for cows where they're like uh you know like cow's valuable you know asset and you don't know if it's sick you got to keep driving around keep checking on it what if you could know before it's too late what tech is working yeah we it is and we're invested a few companies to do that and they'll tag them they'll tag the cattle you know because there is a push to have less antibiotics less you know less uh you know shots and things into into our our food supply so if you're able to identify when they have a fever earlier you can get them segregated from the herd get them away from the herd give them the give them the medicine that they need in a more timely fashion so yeah all those are great you know zotis a publicly traded company they're a leader really probably in the animal health space if you're looking for something a longer term like we're invested in zotis I have a business Sean that my friend's working on that my interest you to Kevin so basically he's putting he's put rft RFD RF RFD RFID sorry tags on chickens and cows and you know how like a chicken will uh like when you buy eggs it says free range and you just kind of trust like I guess that means the chicken was just like out walking around which is better for me because it's somehow healthier and it's also like if you're if you care about animals you're like all right at least I know it had like a better life and whatever but free range I think that's a technical term actually where they it has to have a certain amount of space but I don't think that it's actually necessarily always followed and so what he did was he's putting these these tags onto cows and chickens and so you know the beef that you bought the tag number and you could actually go and see how much did it walk around and where did it go which sounds a little morbid and weird but it's actually supposed to be like reassuring where it like look my farm is now you can hold my farm accountable to know that this meat was actually raised in the way that I promised it was going to be and that's like an interesting idea because I think Sean you said this I think you said uh in like some period of time 20 or 50 or 60 years we're going to look back at the way that we treated cows and we're going to be like that was pretty unfortunate like they it shouldn't have been done that way where an animal is just born in a pen and never leaves and then we eat them and I I actually agree with that I agree with that sentiment where like the way that we treat certain animals I'm cool at eating them but it's it's better to better to them have a certain life and so this idea is kind of interesting to me yeah we think that that's going to be prevalent throughout we think you're gonna Block Chain the farm is what we call it in our world you know you're going a blockchain a farm meaning the fertilizer companies and the put companies are going to have to report all that and you're going to know what was put on whatever it is you're eating or you know and the reason they want to blockchain it is just like remember when spol was having those issues several years back you know with some things they want to be able to go right to the field right to the spot and know exactly what happened and what was put on and what time and where it was at so yeah I agree with you Sam I think that's definitely where the world's headed and and you know I think chrisan Farmers make that transition more and more they're a lot more techsavvy than people giving them credit outs in the world they they're Tech savy as a matter of fact and nobody treats their animals I mean my op I have never been on a farm in my entire life that I seen any abuse to animals I mean nobody treats their animals better just because it's generally typically the way they make their own living the way they make their their money and they teach their kids to take care of the you know they love them and show them in 4 hes and go all around it it's sad that they do get it such a bad rap in the media uh when I've personally never come across it and what's your take on the alternative meat movement thing where in Silicon Valley there's a bunch of startups that are trying to grow beef from cells so that you won't have to farm the animal you won't have to harm the animal to to be able to have the same genetic meat it should be virtually identical genetically identical uh what's your take on that movement and is that where you think things are going I think there will be a segment of the space that continues to grow and I think you're going to see it continue to gain market share I think as as population shifts and moves out uh you know as the Baby Boomers continue to age and move on we get more people I think you're going to see alternative types of pro protein be developed and I think as they get more money in the labs they're getting better at reducing the cost and creating better flavor and I think as those two things continue to move forward just like with Tesla and Elon Musk you know it's it's only a matter of time how's everything happened gradually than all at once and you know it's like the electric vehicle I think you have you know a lot fewer moving Parts it's a lot better than the combustion engine I think you're going to see things you know gradually gain more and more Market year well have Farmers taken to like I always read the comments of like in Texas message boards and things like that they it does it seems like it's 50/50 if like the rural community thinks that electric vehicles are are worth it yeah right now at the time no because just the distance travel you know a lot of folks would travel massive distances out in Rural America and so it doesn't make a lot of of sense to them at the moment I think eventually yes I think they'll see it have better torque you know better low end get up and go out of the hole and I think you'll see a lot more transition I like anything no nobody wants to I guess let go of their Heritage and their roots and you know it's same with the fake meat you know a lot of farmers just bash it and want to go nuts about it I I I think there's definitely going to be a place for it and I think there's it's going to be able to gain and grow some arure you know probably you know as they get costs lower and lower I think it'll be you know a way that we see things happen if you were 24 years old again and you had the entrepreneurial energy to go do something what would you be what would you advise that 24 yearold to go to go do in this space where do you think the opportunity is I think there's going to be a big push with air quality air you know just the quality of air from this whole virus just to testing for the viruses and we're seeing a lot more testing takes place in general uh just over the entire space so I think there's going to be a big push in things to do with air and creating good air quality we're seeing a lot more kids that have asthma or asthma related problems and I think you know not just here in the United States but I'm talking globally and taking what's an example solution what's an example solution of that from an agricultural uh uh perspective well you know we're big right now into the carbon market so you know we're trying to reduce carbon Footprints and no one really reduces it much more than the you know giant cornfield corn field plants you know things of that nature and so you know yeah I think there's a big play and a big push into the carbon trying to reduce like I said trying to reduce the footprint anything that'll help save energy improve our water usage improve water Purity you know I think anything to do with the natural resources that are just going to become more heavily relied upon if we transition all this to Electric I mean the rare earth minerals are going to be hard they're going to be scary I mean there's going to be a lot of plays in you know what we see on the uh on that whole side and that whole front so I think you know natural resources things to do with natural resources things to do with air water like I said food quality you know we really love the blue collar space I mean I think we love you know like what Cody Sanchez has going on or some of the other things we like the thought of buying Blue Collar businesses rolling them up and uh you know kind of packaging up and S them why do you like that because they're they're retiring I think they're retiring I think we did see near as many kids go into the trades as we had in the past you know my dad my wife's dad I mean everybody was in trade back then that was everyone's goal to go to college so you know you just had a big lull or a big I guess you know where just a short supply of good skilled people now we think you can go into that space and we've tried it a couple times and you know where we can build out some things and I think you provide people with good quality service and an onboarding process that you know you can cut your customer retention rate down to a feasible level I I think there's just the sky's a limit on growth you know I do you use Kevin do you use Tik Tok I'm on it yeah I see it have you guys seen the like popularity amongst young people and the trades like it's it like people they glamorize it in in a in a in a cool way uh and I think an accurate way which is like I'm making however 150 or $120,000 I just want to trade two years it goes so well on Tik Tok because it's it's like a novelty it's like going to the zoo it's like wow you made that you know how to do things with your hands and that's what a carrot looks like when you when it comes out like that's incredible uh swipe all right on to the next one then that was easy but but I actually think that some of these young people are actually being influenced by this because they're like [ __ ] I graduated with 150 or 200 Grand in debt and I don't make anything remotely like that amount of money and I'm sitting on my computer all day like this might be a little bit more intriguing and I don't have the any data but it does seem like young people are more open-minded to trades than at least Sean and I's uh like graduating classes yeah I'm seeing that as well we're hearing that from some of the younger kids that are often not to go to college and they going in and be a pipe fitter going into Pipe Fitters union or the plumbing Union or electrical union so yeah we're definitely see AI ain't gonna replace plumbers or or electricians or agag people it maybe one day but but no time soon uh and like I do think that stuff's getting more popular and I think that's really cool and fascinating there's like it's also like ripped buff dude so it's always like chicks like commenting like about like have you seen that guy Sean who just cuts wood yeah the lumber yeah The Lumberjack guy he's incredible I love that it's not just chicks I I'll sit there and I'll watch that video twice it's just an Incredible video it's say guy that uses an Axe and he's sometimes shirtless sometimes not and he's just like you know obviously a 10 out of 10 he's just chopping wood and like everyone's like I need this in my life therapeutic um have you been a part of any rollups uh I always find rollups to be a really interesting business strategy it seems like there's a lot of money to be made in in a successful rollup I'm curious if you've been a part of anything I have not personally no I usually either Exit ahead of time or you know get a little nervous or it blames out but I have a couple of friends that yeah that's their whole their whole way they've created all their wealth you got one of the gentleman I'm speaking of right now he's doing it with uh cranes he's buying small crane companies uh that'll have two or three cranes and he's buying them and he's putting them all together and uh you know he's going to sell that out and he's done it with several other things whether it's restaurants or different things in the past so yeah I thought it was interesting on the crane play you know he came me about an investment I we just didn't do it but uh I'm sure he'll hit a huge home run with it dude Sean I think the [ __ ] that Kevin's doing is way more exciting than the [ __ ] that our friends are doing you gonna quit and go do it I no I don't know about that it sounds like a lot of work sounds like a lot of lot of words then if you're not going to go do it you know what means is I like hanging out with these types of people sometimes that's what it means yeah it gives you guys you know I think it gives both of us I like hanging out with your group of people because I think it gives me different perspective and learn different things that you guys have going on that I can make applicable to my world as well and so you know yeah there's a good Synergy there between all and how do you do that practically because I think you do a good job of getting yourself into positions like we talked about going to random conferences that are totally outside your industry that you didn't need to go to but you wanted to go to to to shift your lens a little bit or hanging out with younger people who may be demographically just doing different things culturally doing different things than the guy who made it and is at a country club now might might be disconnected from whatever the culture shifts are how do you tactically go about doing that how do you put yourself in those positions what questions do you ask honestly just make myself I always yelled at the kids and we were growing up so I played Sports at a high level and had several friends at One World Series and you know Super Bowls we always talk you know we you get a bad coach you know everybody get a bad coach or things like that and it's like look man you got to be able to steal something from the guy the guy was great player he was you know you got to go in there with an open mind and you got to be able to take away some things that they've done well and that they've done positive and then use those and put those erors in your quiver so I just always have the kids looking for new crazy weird conferences or things to go to and and from there I make myself go the last couple years I didn't want to go and I'm like but each time I went I'm I I took away several little gold nuggets that we implemented into our business models and Hell we've made big returns on them each one of them and you know I didn't think I'd get anything out of going to the car and I was just like this is going to be a waste but I just sucked it up and did it in you know it's like going to work out or you got a run or something it's like a [ __ ] I guess I just gotta go do it yeah we had a friend when we were going to farm conon who was supposed to come with us it was me Ben and our buddy and the morning of we were like hey we'll meet you in the lobby um you know your flight was you landed like an hour ago right and he basically woke up looked at and he said Kansas City he looked at the flight time then he's like ah you know what and he just bailed and I was like man uh but but of course I I felt that everybody feels that in the moment like God do I really want to go do this thing that I don't have to do that is unknown right it's it's back to your thing about are you willing to Sprint for an unknown distance and um we didn't know what value we would get out of it that was the hard part that was the challenge and doing it when we didn't know what would come out of it was really really valuable um and it's ironic because that same friend he um he gave he gave me a great analogy one time we were talking into a younger friend this guy was the youngest VC in Silicon Valley so 19 20 years old he was investing I don't know10 million into to things he was like he got written up as the youngest VC in Silicon Valley so we we're meeting with this guy but now five years have gone by and it was like you hadn't seen him really progressing at that same rate that you would expect somebody who definitely had that sort of Phenom type of uh upbringing uh where it seemed like he had all the potential in the world and I was like man what do you think he's doing wrong what would you do differently he goes oh it's it's like Windows and Doors he goes he's only willing to do something if it's a window if he can immediately see through and see the what's on the other side of it then he'll do it but anytime there's a door and it's opaque and you don't know what's on the other side of it he's not willing to knock on a door and open it up and see what might be inside he's only looking at doors and he at Windows he's never willing to go through a door and if once he starts going through doors he's this guy's career is going to take off and I remember hearing that and really taking that you know to heart because I thought that was very very wise that's a great analogy yeah I never heard that before so I've heard a lot that's yeah that's a great one there for sure so Sean the reason why you like a lot of these folks in the Midwest and some folks in the in the south is because you love phrases you love phrases like Windows and Doors you love cool things and you know what I love them too and that's why I'm happy I'm friends with both of you guys love we were at a dinner so at farmcon you invited us to like a private dinner at the end it's like 10 people this guy stands up and he delivers two of the coldest lines I've ever heard so he stands up and uh we're doing our intros like a and so I stand up and I give some super vanilla intro hi I'm Sean I live in San Francisco and I'm uh I'm interested I'm a tech founder and an investor all right sit down forgettable this guy stands up he's got a big presence and he goes um I for I don't remember what his his name was exactly but he he said he goes you know uh I don't know a lot of things I don't know I don't know the score of the game right now there's a big game going on he's goes I don't know the score of the game right now now I don't know anything about this and he goes he goes hell I don't know where the remote is in my house half the time but I know deals and I made a lot of deals he's like I'm a private Equity guy and he starts talking about his deal making I was like Wow and he goes I've been around for a long time you cut me open you can see a lot of rings in the middle I was like wow that's one way of saying it he just on fire and he goes somebody go somebody ask him they go what if well what if they don't what if they don't go for it on this deal sounds like you really need them to to say yes what if what if they say no what if you get rejected he goes I'm not afraid of rejection he's a big big old dude and he goes I've stood in front of women in my life naked before I've heard no no no no no I'm okay with it I was like wow this guy is like half comedian half businessman and I loved it but it was just it was just another day at the office for him but for me coming from from our world that was like the Charisma levels and the the the the the gift of the gab was so was so incredible to see I loved it yeah it's definitely why times yeah and you got that too a little bit uh that I like just hearing what you have to say Kevin and uh for the people listening maybe maybe we'll get you some new subscribers it's the Van Trump report.com I I like your uh you always you do something cool where you'll just like have a selfie with you and your wife and you like say today we're on vacation here's what we're doing and you'll say something kind of funny and cute and uh I love it we should just get like a group of 20 of our of our listeners a select small group to go to farmcon and we'll all go together as a field trip next uh next time you guys do it when is it first week in January January 8 and 9th this year coming up how much is the ticket I think this year we're like 12200 bucks or something and you sell a lot of them too right yeah we'll sell out whatever they give us you know I capacity way we sell out the hotel every year yeah we appreciate you doing this you're the man thank you and thank you for uh years of being a cool dude you've always been a great guy to me so thank you yeah I appreciate it good luck to both you guys and your families and that's the Pod thank you very much [Music]

all right we're live Sean I've got a story for you and this story I'm going to take a weird take on this I have a weird take on this and I'm going to appeal to all the young single men out there all right this your specialty young single men let's [Music] go all right listen the story is about Ed Thorp have you ever heard that name Ed Thorp sounds like a swimmer no it does sound like a swimmer but he's not so Ed Thorp I'm reading his biography called man for all markets so Ed Thorp today he's 91 so what does that mean he's born in the 1940s 1930s Ed Thorp he grew up as a math Wiz kid he was like a a prodigy at a young age grew up in a very poor household didn't have a lot of money but as a young kid when he was like 12 and 13 years old he got moved up a bunch of grades and he took uh a bunch of standardized tests and at the time when he lived in California he got something like the highest scores in California for high schoolers when he was like 13 years old and at the time they didn't have calculators but they had like little counting devices and he would take these tests without these counting devices because he couldn't afford them and he still crushed it he killed it So eventually Ed Thorp he gets a scholarship to Berkeley and then he goes to UCLA where he gets his PhD in mathematics and he becomes a professor and he starts going down this track where he's in his 30s and he's This brilliant professor and whatever but then he does something interesting interesting he gets interested in applying his theories to real life situations because he's like reading these academic papers and he's like this is cool and all but we got to apply this stuff and his specialty was probability and statistics and he got super interested in how he could use his theories to beat Blackjack oh this is the gambling guy I saw this guy on Tim Ferris this guy's interesting is because he's done so much more than just these few little stories I'm going to tell but basically you could actually verify this Blackjack is what 51% chance the house is going to win is that right is it like 5149 51 52 something like that yeah so it's a small uh margin but back in the 60s when he was kind of getting going he had this Theory where he thought that if he saw the the cards on the table he could have a higher probability of getting 21 because he basically could count cards changing the ratio of 51% in the uh users uh perspective so he was 51% of winning the house was 49% chance so he creates this paper where he explains all this and inevitably people are like man this is just some academic Theory there's no way that you're going to be able to do this and so Thorp is is is a fun guy and he's like we got to prove it so he builds out this blackjack table at his house and he gets his wife to smoke cigarettes and blow cigarette smoke into his face while she's talking to him and like annoying him and then he has friends come over who like are drinking alcohol and like yelling in his face as if he's at a casino to distract and he spends a handful of months doing this and it starts working and he's like I think this actually can work I think I can do this and he publishes this paper and all these people reach out he gets hundreds of letters but eventually he gets this one letter from this guy named Manny and Manny he doesn't really know it at the time but after a while Ed kind of realizes that Manny is basically in the mob he helped make bootlegging a thing in the 20s when alcohol was illegal and Manny goes hey Ed let's see if you can actually pull this off I'm GNA front you 10 grand and we're going to split the winnings 10 grand at the time in the 60s is something like 80 grand so it was a lot of money particularly for a professor who's making the equivalent of 100 $150,000 back then and so they go and they spend this week this weekend at a Cino in Las Vegas and they make $1,000 in profit and Ed's like holy moly this thing works but he doesn't really want to become like totally a professional gambler but he's really interested in proving his theories and he eventually he writes a book uh on this and if you Google Ed Thor Blackjack book he wrote this book in the 60s that was a massive hit and to to Ed this was all just a big like fun game a way to like prove that his research wasn't just academic but it could actually be used and this book was a massive hit and it was one of the first times that academic research was like used in real life and it went straight to the masses as opposed to him publishing more papers but this meant now that he was known in the casino world in the casino world back then Vegas was just getting going and so it was small enough that they all the casinos could know what Ed looked like and all the dealers would know what he looks like and what his name is and so he eventually goes back every handful of weekends and he has to wear a disguise and he's but he still ends up ends up cleaning them all out and next he goes well Blackjack was cool let's see if I can do this with roulette and so he goes you know roulette is a little bit unlike Blackjack where I don't even know if there is necessarily at least it doesn't appear so there's a lot of skill because it's all like where the ball on this spinning wheel but he has this weird theory that if he can see if he can like quickly count how fast the wheel is going and where the ball starts and where it hits the wheel somehow he's able to calculate 51% in his odds where the ball is going to land and this sounds like a crazy idea right I mean that just sounds uh impossible to me as somebody who has spent a lot of time at roulette wheel being able to figure out while while the wheel is turning where the ball is going to land and it I mean when the ball hits it bounces like in a random Direction based on the spin and the speed and everything like for somebody to do that in their head would be I'd have to see that to believe that it sounds impossible right and that's what interested him is is he was a math nerd and he was really fascinated with the game of proving his theories correctly and so what he did was he took a small uh computer and he basically assembled a small computer and the way it worked is he would have a two-person team and so he would be at the table placing the BET and he had have two people on the side and they had these little small computers and they had little buttons in their shoes and they would calculate where they thought the ball was going to roll to and they would tap their feet in order to keep the Cadence of the wheel and it would help him predict where the ball was going to go and that music the the the Taps it kind of sounded like music would go into his his earpiece that he was wearing and he would make a bet and this was actually the world's first wearable you know like an iPhone or like like an eyewatch is a wearable this was the world's first wear bable and it worked and he killed it he made a lot of money and he wrote a book on this he did it again but now we're going to fast forward to him 10 years doing these experiments he's got some money something like $100,000 at the time which was a lot of money for a professor and he needs to invest his money because he just doesn't want it sitting there and so he spends a few months learning everything he can about investing basically just reading books he just read lots of books and as he said he wanted to understand the math behind all of this and so he start in investing in publicly traded companies and he loses a lot of money at first he said I had to pay my tuition to Mr Money Market because it gets a lot of it wrong but then he discover discovers options and this part is a bit out of my expertise to explain how he does this but it involves both shorting a company and buying the company's actual stock so predicting the company's stock is going to go down while buying the stock but in doing that he studied the the the option that he was going to purchase as well as the current stock price and in doing that he was able to hedge it so he would only lose a little bit amount of money but make a whole bunch of money and for him he actually didn't look at any of the stock information as in what the company was selling so you know you have guys who like do value investing and they're like well I think that this brand is undervalued that wasn't him it was all just a math game to him but after a year or two it starts working and he starts making a little bit of money and so now we're in the 70s and there's another professor at his university who starts hearing that Ed is now investing in stocks and he's doing quite well he's tells of his co-workers he's like I might make more of my more than my salary this year investing it's going quite well and so one of his professors has invested his money the professor's money in this small little fund called Buffet Associates and of course it was run by this guy waren Buffett out of Omaha and this professor was like Hey this guy who I invested in waren he's gonna uh wind down his fun he's crushed it for me but he just wrote this letter saying he can't find any more good deals which in the Buffett actually paused investing for like 5 years he didn't want to invest because he's like I can't find any good deals right now I'm just going to sit and do nothing I'm going to wind down my fun and the professor goes hey look this guy's running down his fun why don't you you know he's got some free time I'm friendly with him I'm gonna invite him over to my house I'll invite you over and we'll just shoot the [ __ ] and maybe you'll have a new friend in the investing industry because you don't really know anyone else doing this I'll I'll help make the introduction Buffett comes over for dinner and Ed Thorp and him get along beautifully hand in hand like pots and pans they're they're really close they become great friends and they love hanging out that day and a few weeks after the the dinner the professor goes hey look Ed I was kind of testing you I kind of wanted Warren to like s like kind of see what's up with you he gave he gave a thumbs up he said you're really smart and that your ideas are good can I take this money that I got back from waren Buffett and give it to you to invest and it's like taking other people's money that's not really what I I've been doing I I've just been doing this for my own I guess I'll try it and so he teams up with another guy and they rais something like $5 million over the course of six months and they have Buffet stamp of approval and so they start basically one of the very first hedge funds ever and particularly a he's a Quant which is common nowadays but Ed Thorp was the first Quant where he didn't really look at the companies he just looked at the numbers and he killed it so over the course of 30 years he made something like 20 to 25% per year which is massive I don't know what what has Buffett made do you know probably something like that but over the course of Buffets is like 20 yeah yeah it's like 20 but over the course of like 60 years yeah for a lot longer all right guys really quick so back when I was running the hustle we had this premium newsletter called Trends the way it worked was we hired a ton of analysts and we created this sort of playbook for researching different companies and ideas and emerging Trends to help you make money and build businesses well HubSpot did something kind of cool so they took this Playbook that we developed and we gave to our analysts and they turned it into an actionable guide and resource that anyone can download and it breaks down all the different methods that we use for spotting upcoming trends for spotting different companies that are going to explode and grow really quickly so if you want to stay ahead of the game and you want to find cool business ideas or different niches that most people have no idea they exist this is the ultimate guide so if you want to check it out you can see the link Down Below in the description now back to the show and so Ed Thorp basically invented counting cards with Blackjack and then made a book on he invented uh this roulette game and the world's first wearable which all these things by the way eventually became illegal they weren't illegal or I don't know if it's illegal or against the rules but they basically are banned in casinos because of him and he parlays all this learning and all this experience into creating the world's first hedge fund and becoming one of the first quants and he knocks it out the park the guy kills it I think he made something like $800 million and then eventually fast forward to today or more like 2005 he shuts down fun because he's like I have enough I don't need anymore this has been fun while it lasted I'm out he's one of the few guys to just be winning and he just says that's enough I'm done so he completely shuts it down so now he's 92 years old he still does push-ups and pull-ups he's really into fitness he does not look 90 I saw him on the Tim FIS podcast that can't have been that long ago he was 89 then on the Tim FIS podc like a he looks honestly like somebody who's early 60s he looks great yeah and here's the part where I promise I'm going to try and weave this into advice to the young man Ed Thorp is so fascinating to me and the reason he's fascinating to me is because I don't know if you'll admit to this you probably will if you did it did you ever read that book the game did you ever read like books on like how to meet women not only did I read the game not only did my girlfriend in high school buy the game for me before I went to college as a goodbye gift was that her breakup gift it's over between us stay together but let me help you out here not only did those two things happen two nights ago I reread the game and I'm a married man I reread the game because I was like that book was amazing back then I wanted to learn the style of it I was like what was great about that book so I went back and I reread it two nights ago so it's crazy you brought it up so that's a great book so anyone most men in their in their 30s nowadays probably read that when they were 14 it was like the Bible because all of us nerds were like I desperately want to be loved how do I Be Loved whatever and there was a lot of [ __ ] in that book the number of times used the cube test like there's not a woman on Duke campus that didn't get the cube test from me which one was the cube test it's like a cold read where you're like I want you to close your eyes imagine a cube it's it's in floating in the desert how big is the cube if they say it's big they're self-confident if they say it's small they have no ego is the cube see-through is it colored oh it's it's kind of see-through well you you don't let people in easily but when you do you really do connect with people at a deep level that's so me and then you just go on so on and so forth about the relationships and about their way they view the world and by the end of it they're like this guy this guy's going to be in the friend zone it's really what happened to me but I think for for better looking people it probably work better than that they are like a cat and you were just holding a string just like trying to entertain them and they're like yeah I'm done with you that's another thing in the book cat String Theory that's actually another principle they have well and this is where it gets really nerdy but one of the parts of that book and that whole movement there was a lot of [ __ ] in that book and then that movement um but one of the parts that I always took to heart was the best way to attract other both men and women is to be an interesting person and what that means is basically people like ambitious people and being passionate about Hobbies is under that umbrella of being ambitious and I remember as a kid I love that because I'm like wait you're telling me I could just like work on myself and I'll attract others that sounds like the greatest thing ever and and and I believe it to be true as I've gotten older I've notied I've gotten less interesting and the reason I've gotten less interesting there's a few reasons there the first is that I've developed higher expectations towards most things that I do or rather I've just developed expectations as opposed to just doing something just for fun like you do thing as a kid just because you're intrigued and you're like I don't know where this is going to go but I'm just gonna I'm just G to follow it whereas now there's expectations for everything that I do and I want to have I'm I'm a little bit more interested in the outcome the other thing that I've noticed lately about me and why I've become less interesting is because I've been distracted with social media just like how you're typing right now as I'm talking to you it's so much easier to be distracted nowadays with Twitter and slack and email and text I find myself getting so distracted and so I don't have a significant amount of like deep thought or like going deep on something it's more so like I'm being on the defense where people throw information at me and I react to it as opposed to like spending time pursuing something that interests me just because it interests me and so the reason why Ed Thorp the reason why I I like reading about him and particularly for young men listening is he's kind of inspired me to just pursue more Hobbies just for the sake of learning and here's an example when he was developing his roulette game he basically went and bought an old roulette table at an auction for like $500 and he just sat at home in the evening with his wife and they're like hey let's just see if we can like count this game it it was almost like what's that one g board game called Settlers of Katan yeah you know how like people just like get into that random stuff and they're like let's just see if we can Master this game it sounds fun and that's exactly how it's started with him a lot of these things that became massive outcomes for him they were just like interesting little hobbies for him and they started very rudimentary have you ever read about Dr Richard fiman of course so fman was one of the guys who was important for a variety of reasons including helping make the atomic bomb and all these things and he had little like weird things about him where he's like why can dogs smell so good he's like well I asked myself that and then I just put my head close to the floor and I noticed I can smell things on the floor and like that's like like it's like really simple ways to like prove or disprove a theory where you start at like very basic principles and you're like let's just see if this works you know Justin Khan used to call himself uh he had some tagline for himself when he was making content he used to say hey it's me it's Justin your favorite Founder's favorite founder and that was like how you always talked about himself your favorite Founders favorite founder and I feel like Fineman is kind of that it's like your favorite gurus favorite Guru or your favorite thinkers favorite thinker it's like everybody who you love their thoughts they love Fineman and the fan technique and they love all fineman's books and his writings everybody you respect respects fan yeah I think Tim Ferris holding company is called Fineman Inc or something like that dude that's actually genius to just be like yeah fan and Ferris Associates put yourself with them just like ah yes this is the purian musk consultancy how can I help you yeah just like borrow from their credibility but there's guys like fan and Ed Thorp is now in that sphere where they just get interested in some things that seem so silly and they do it a very rudimentary level and it goes from level to level to level to level but it starts at level one you know who's exactly like this Jack Smith Jack Smith is like that yeah Jack Smith is he's one of these guys jack is a buddy of ours you're really good friends with him I think you've known him for a lot longer than than I have but he is such an interesting guy he built companies he so he built a company called vungle sold it his whole origin story was one of the very first podcasts on this feed so if you go back Jack was in there and he talked about you know when he was a high schooler what he was doing flipping things on eBay and then how he packed his way into an accelerator then once he was in the accelerator how he figured out this adtech company how the experts told him there's no way son you don't understand how the ad business Works he's like yeah that's my strength I don't understand how this works so when I approach it it's I'm G to approach it differently and what he did was the whole the way the whole ad industry Works was all based on CPM Impressions so it's a billboard how many people are going to see this billboard that's how I charge you and he's like well that's kind of stupid if I was advertising I don't want people to see it I want people to buy from me or I want people to download my app I want the action so what if we just paid for the action and it became CPA instead of CPM and so he reinvented in a way that's a little bit generous I would say there's other people doing this but Jack and his co-founder created vongal sold it for $700 million and it was really based around this mobile gaming ad Network that was going to do things a little differently the way other people were doing them he sold it for 750 million when he was 29 years old like crazy stuff and for example again thinking from first principal so like what should the ad be everybody else did video ads and so you would be playing a game it would stop a video take over the screen and it would be a video commercial and then you'd be like when when can I click the X so I can get back to playing a game and what Jack realized was he's like well the best way to advertise a game is actually just play the game for a second oh it's it's about shooting the ball into this hoop well like let them try to shoot a couple times they miss and they want to make it and they make it and then now they got a sample so they created an ad unit that was just a mini version of the game that worked way better than the video ad and it was again many times over of just thinking from firstman tools how could I do this but now since selling the company he had his Thor enough moment where he did not need to go create another company and instead got really into other things he's like you know I need to buy an office chair he goes and he looks he's kind of uninspired he's like well certainly there's been some studies on the best way to sit so what is the best way to sit and he'll go and he'll read research papers about the best way to sit he'll test chairs and he ultimately ends up building this crazy ergonomic chair himself in his garage over the period of about six or eight months did you see the chair it looks like a dentist chair he's laying down in this crazy position and it's like a a work chair but at any time if you ask him like hey Jack what do you nowadays he felt zero pressure or at least caved to zero of the pressure of having some important sounding answer because he just did what was important to him rather than what sounded important to others so he'd be like um just you know just messing around you're like no what does that mean like what do you do every day Jack he's like well I'm really working on trying to build a chair you know I got really interested in chairs and you know sitting I sit for six hours a day and I just thought well why don't I sit in a better chair and so I started researching chairs so I've bought 52 chairs and I've been testing them and then I've decided you to build my own this the best of each of these that's what he'll do for one year and then the next year he'll do something completely different just off of his curiosity and the cake one year for his birthday the cake that his wife made for him at his party was was shaped like an Amazon box because he'd orders so many chairs or so many whatever things that he's interested in that that he had a room in his home just dedicated to all the boxes yeah he had a small like FBA fulfilled by Amazon facility in his in his Pantry just to test out every single product and at one point they banned him on Amazon they banned him on Amazon for returning too much stuff because he would buy all the stuff to test it out but yeah Jack is perfectly like that but does this resonate with you where you're like I need to just pursue more things without having an big outcome in mind we haveen been talking a ton but that's become the theme of my I don't know the last 12 15 months or so I heard this quote Nal said this thing on some podcast and he goes too many of us live where we're doing things today for some future reward some future payoff I'm not doing what I want to be doing now but I'm putting in the time I'm putting in the work I'm putting in the for some future payoff and he goes that's understandable we all start there he's like but the day you start doing things where the the thing you're doing in and of itself is the reward that's the day you've retired people think retirement is when you stop working you go sit down you chill you do nothing it's not that you do nothing it's that you do the things you want to do because the act of doing them itself is the payoff and you're not sure there might be some upside in the future but that's not why you did it and when I heard that I was like okay that's what I need to be doing I don't know how I'm going to get there and I've many times had little detours off of that where I start to do something opportunistic because oh it's going to pay off in the future but I've just continued to bring myself back to that that moment which was I want this next chapter of my life to be all about I'm doing things where the only criteria is the act of doing it has to be rewarding enough for it to have been worth it and that one criteria eliminates like 98% % of the possible things I want to do because if I'm honest with myself and I say well why do I want to do this it's because it might make a bunch of money or it might pay off in this thing later it doesn't it could be business related it could be relationships related it could why do I want to meet this person or go to this event oh because it might lead to something no no no I'm only going to this event if the event itself is the payoff I'm only hanging out with this person if the hangout is the payoff not because it's gonna lead to something else it can be did you determine what that is do you deter have you that's actually really hard is figuring out what the play is what I realized is it's less of a thing so I thought like you're just asking me this question I thought it's a thing I got to find my thing my new thing that's the thing I just love to do and I'm doing it for the sake of doing it what I realize is it's fundamentally different it's not a thing it's a approach and it's a filter and so actually it's a question that I ask at the beginning of any anything I'm going to do that day which is am I doing this for some deferred payoff some deferred benefits or am I doing this because I actually enjoy doing this and so it changed the way I did everything so for example with my workouts there was a version of workouts that I did because whatever just just bite bite the bullet just do this and you're gonna it'll pay off later when you get fit versus well why don't I just do workouts that the workout itself is so satisfying of course if I do that I'm going to do it more often I'm gonna do it with my full effort and I'm gonna still get the reward in the end so I started working with this like boxing coach or playing basketball different things that I wasn't doing before because I was willing to settle for doing something that today kind of sucks but in the future maybe it's going to turn out great and I realized I had lived basically like 35 years of my life with the this kind of sucks now but oh it's gonna it's all going to pay off in the end I realize it's a false choice you don't have to do that you can just filter every activity on is the act of doing this going to be worth it even if it's challenging it doesn't mean everything is so happy but is the act of doing this the reward or am I doing this only for some future payoff so it became a a filtering criteria not a one thing so for example I told you I was reading the book The Game the other day why did I do that I was I reading a book in the middle of the day especially an old book that I'd already read before that had no relevance to me because I'm not trying to be a pickup artist or or hit on women anymore right that's not what I was doing but it was the thing I was most interested in that moment and so I did it because the act of doing it was the reward because I was most interested in it and I've done that with other Hobbies like picked up playing the piano and I started doing other things that are all falling into this bucket and I've never been so you can hear it in my voice I've never been so switched on after making this sort of shift in the way I chose what to work on and that's a very I'm going to say the p word that's a very privileged way to go about it which is if you hit the lottery like maybe we have or I mean we've worked hard but we've got lucky as well where that's a very privileged way to go about it and so I do think you have to eat [ __ ] for a certain period of time and also get some luck but yeah I'm very drawn to this way of living I'm not sure that that's true that's 100% true the reason I say that is first whenever somebody calls you privilege I'm like that's a compliment I think they they mean it as an insult people use it as an egg not you in this case but I'm saying most people if you call someone privileged you're trying to tear them down I want my life to be described as one of privilege that's the point you are giving me a compliment that's like saying wow you're really good at this or this comes effortlessly to you or whatever I want my life to be described that way that is a goal of mine and I just mean that because most people will treat that as a negative and then they try to make themselves smaller right it's a little bit of like the tall poppy syndrome where if you have the freedom to do something and you are not doing it because you're worried about how it looks or how it sounds or how it others don't have that privilege you're wasting your privilege I think that's a it's a bad thing let me let me answer the other part which is I would say that the most successful project I've ever done more than any of the companies i' ever built or any job I ever had has been this this podcast this podcast from a usage like people listen to this they like it so customers are happiest financially it's a very lucrative product that affords a very good lifestyle but also just the my enjoyment of it the act of doing it I don't do this episode for some future payoff I do this episode because it's going to be fun to do I enjoy this conversation this conversation Enough by the time we click stop I've got my payoff and when I started the podcast I literally wrote down that I'm going to lose money doing this that I expect that nobody will listen to this and I'm going to do it anyways because it'll be so fun to record these episodes talking to interesting people and learning that it'll make it worth it and I wrote down I I have this Google doc I'll share it it says my forecast is I will lose $10,000 a year doing this my forecast is that really no nobody but my mom is going to listen to this thing and it's still worth doing what were the other predictions so I got into this position because I made a choice like that four years ago right like that that and so I don't think I also thought well you got to eat [ __ ] for a while before you get to go do the fun things I don't believe that that's actually true I know a lot that's 100% true think about it let's say you're a 40-year-old landscaper with three kids it is one way to do things I know a bunch of Engineers who work on projects that they are personally interested in they build for personal projects and one goes kind of nowhere two goes kind of nowhere but it doesn't matter they're building up their skills they're having fun doing it and sure enough by the third the fourth the fifth either they've built up skills where they're a highly valuable person that gets brought into a project that's already working and they get paid handsomely for it or they one of their projects takes off but the whole time they were just doing the thing that they really like to do I think that there is one way to win which is grind and eat [ __ ] and pay your dues work up the ladder pick whichever cliche you want and that that is a way to win I know several people that from the beginning they were driven by working on the things that were interesting to them like any en Thorp type of guy right um and when they when they're working on things that were interesting them it led to good outcomes because when you work on things that are interesting you work on it longer harder than than a person who's just doing it for a reward you get better at it and when you get really good at something that's when the payoffs tend to come well I believe that can be true and also it can be true that it's more challenging logistically for certain people for example you're a blue coll labor with three kids at 40 years old you work from 6:00 a.m. to 700 p.m. and you're like there's just no time and I just got to pay the bills I do think that it's just more challenging for many of the people listening right now I believe you are totally right which is we probably have a lot of college educated particularly College age kids who don't have too much responsibility and they should lean into this this thing and I completely believe that to be true and I believe also to be true that as you grow this type of mindset gets Stamped Out Of You the world wants you to be vanilla yeah absolutely let me ask you a different question of the people we know that are successful just give me a rough number what percentage do you think got there through the grind do [ __ ] they didn't like that paid off in an unsexy way and then now they work on things that are more interesting pleasurable they're driven by curiosity they're driven by fashion they're driven by whatever versus people that made it by following things they were curious about maybe it was a bit of a lonely road for a bit maybe other people maybe it wasn't a hot Market but it became hot but they were there already right that happens a lot what percentage would you say in each I'm just curious roughly how how you would think about it is it like only 5% got successful through following their own their own interest fundamentally or do you think that it's 50/50 that got got successful following their interest versus following what was more proven if I had to guess 60 to 70% of the people who we know who we would consider wealthy enough that money doesn't really matter probably made money in a way that looking back they were like that was really hard and miserable and I don't think I can do that again and then a large percentage of them now I would say only 50% of them then go and pursue something that truly interests them and the other 50% just do the Playbook again and are miserable while earning a great living yeah so roughly let's say 20 25 percent you think maybe we in the the bucket that I'm talking about which is they were just doing what's interesting to them and that happened to become something that was very successful versus people who chose things that were not as interesting or not as fun for them but they thought were gonna have a payoff and it did and here's why why combinator is like the stereotypical Silicon Valley like story you go to White combinator how long's white combinator eight or 12 weeks three months maybe three months yeah okay so you go with one idea and you only have 12 weeks to decide if this is go to work or not and by week six they say dude this sucks you should pivot this amazing idea you had to do credit card processing or to do something else that people want to give you money for and so they just go ah [ __ ] it whatever I gotta go down that path but that path that they're signing up for is a 10-year Journey or more and so there wasn't too much thought with it and so they're just like man I just got to get a win however way I can and I only have another six weeks until I've got to go do demo day so I've got to just settle on something and move forward and do it and I think that that mentality is often what a lot of internet based businesses are built on so I think that's a little unfair to YC because for example if I think that does happen but one of the things that happens in those pivots because I've invested in a lot of YC companies that pivot and also if you read Paul Graham's essay one of the things Paul Graham advises heavily against is the what he calls playing startup it's like playing house where you sort of just try to manufacture a startup idea that you think might work or the think might be good he's like the best way to figure out a startup idea is to scratch your own Edge and to look at your own life and figure out in what place am I already living in some future that other people aren't but I could build a product that would help them get there or what's a paino we've discovered along the way of doing this that we could solve so yes they pivot quickly and they pivot in the middle of Y see but usually the advice is that you should pivot to something the pro like the itch that you want scratched the problem that you are currently having or the thing you you uniquely understand because of the way you live your life versus uh what other people do and the biggest successes out a YC have typically been that right I agree the Airbnb guys renting out their own apartment to make hey or Brian Armstrong doing coinbase because he lived in Argentina and dealt with the currency issues and was interested in Bitcoin these are not ideas that fundamentally sounded good the biggest successes I think are done that way yeah but not the average success I think that's exactly right I think the most successful people work that way but the average or the majority are not that way um and I think that's probably the true statement I I would have to go look through why commenter companies but there's not that many 23y olds that know anything about payroll processing software but there's a lot of 25y olds or whatever who have created something really cool like that our friend Jack why did he do vungle I think he was curious of solving problems but he didn't have a problem he wanted success more than he wanted he wanted he was like this just seems like intriguing I guess like yeah let's he's someone who made a shift I would also say some there's a confounding factor which is that for a lot of the people who are friends the thing that they were interested in is the game so it's not the industry that they that was the passionate thing the passionate thing was playing the game of business can I give you two related things that came up for me I don't know if you remember this but when the open AI drama was going on when they fired Sam Alman one of the things that came out was maybe they have AGI internally and everyone's like no they probably don't have AGI internally but maybe there was some breakthrough because he had gone at some conference and said there are these moments with open AI where you're sitting in a room and you get to see a demo and your mind gets blown you've seen the future the world is not the same because of what you just saw he goes that just happened about 3 weeks ago and people didn't know what it was but he was kind of just like teasing a little bit and just he wasn't even trying to make a hype thing he was just trying to say like what it's like to work there he he was trying to use it for some other reason but people took that and they're like man they must have something Sam Alman said that or an employee said that Sam Alman had said that and so people started speculating what is it and then these leaks happen they started talking about this thing called qar you remember this do you remember this qar thing yeah I don't know what it is though so qar I I I'm not a AI PhD researcher so I don't know exactly but the idea is like there are different algorithms or different methods you can use to do something and qar is a certain technique and so people were like oh qar does that mean they're using the the Q technique or the star technique or whatever that's not what people are using today but maybe there's something there and so this thing leaks it's not been confirmed yet whether that's was or wasn't a thing but what ended up happening was there was a whole bunch of smart people that suddenly started sniffing around that technique and just recently a bunch of research papers got published saying that they're seeing amazing performance using this technique and so this guy came on and he talked about that this is actually a phenomenon that happens frequently so I'll just tie this together this guy Robert kwanzi was tweeted this I I don't know this guy but he tweeted this little story that I liked and he said Claud Shannon once told me that as a kid he remember being stuck on a jigsaw puzzle and his brother was passing by and said you know I could tell you something that would help you with this puzzle but now I'm not going to do it that's all the brother said but that was enough of a hint for Claude to solve the puzzle the great thing about the hint is that you can always give this to yourself so basically there's this this phenomenon that happens in human behavior which is that if you knew that there might be a win you don't even need to know what the thing is that alone will increase your probability of success do you know want to know what else Claude Shannon did do you remember how I told you Ed Thorp went to the roulette table and it required two people to be in the that was the other guy so in if you look It Up's like it's called I think it's like the Thorp Shannon principal and it's like the theory of so Claude Shannon who this guy is referencing he was the guy who was tapping his foot to tell at DOR which pretty funny so the Second Story That's same principle is about kaggle so kaggle is this online competitive place for solving you know problems riddles puddles puzzles whatever it is I think I don't know if it's all coding or if it's just math puzzles so this replied in the thing he goes one of my favorite cgle facts is that anytime that the leaderboard gets stagnant for a while in in any competition if one team suddenly makes a jump that will automatically cause multiple independent teams to quickly reproduce the same breakthrough with no knowledge of how the first team made the Breakthrough and isn't that kind of amazing how it's like it's the four-minute mile right uh what's the guy name r the so when uh prior to Roger bister running 4minute miles people were only like 3 seconds like 403 44 which is quite a long distance away from 4 minutes but basically when Roger banister did it roughly four other Runners also broke four minute miles within like three months of Roger banister doing it right so the same thing just happened to me in one of my businesses so in one of my businesses we had there was a marketing tactic or channel that we had looked at we had even kind of dabbled with but we didn't exactly know how to do it kind of seemed like a puzzle we didn't know how to solve so we put it on a shelf for a while and then I heard a whisper that somebody else was just crushing it using that channel now I don't know what they're doing I don't know the technique that they're doing I don't know how much they're crushing it I just heard enough to know that they are crushing it and immediately we mobilized and that same channel that looked kind of like a dead thing before to us we didn't really know how to make any progress we still didn't have any technique nobody gave us a tool of how to make progress just the knowledge that somebody else was making progress in that same channel fired us up got us going and we immediately found a breakthrough and over the weekend we did like 30 Grand in revenue on this one channel and it reminded me of the same principle of just the knowledge that there is a solution actually increases your probability of getting to a solution just the knowledge that somebody else has found a solution without telling you how at all will increase your probability and I think that's one of the things about this podcast that should help people that's one of the ways to use this podcast is that you're not going to do exactly what any of the stories we tell in this podcast do but just hearing other people's success just hearing other people ran a four-minute mile will make you run a four-minute mile we've had this with our friends too people who are saying within um you know I'm gonna make x amount of money in y months right we had a friend that was like I'm gonna try to make a million dollars in three months and just hearing that question I didn't have that question before just hearing that question got me to start thinking about ways you could do it then hearing that somebody did it immediately made me want to figure out how and even though I was not going to do any of the things that they did it allowed me to figure out a solution that would be able to do that I think that's one of the most underrated learning techniques you can have or or like success techniques you could have what's that called the MFM Paradox that you can become more successful following somebody else even though you don't know what they did just the fact that they this is and this is like way less cool than artificial intelligence but similarly when morning breu and the hustle were first getting going with the newsletter business we had the exact same thing happen multiple times where eventually I became one time Austin came over after we had both sold and I was like hey you want to see something cool and I go pull up your computer I'll pull up mine I know you got a document that shows everything that you guys were doing per month let me show you mine and you show me yours and it was the exact same thing by the way it was we were we were seeing little inklings of what the other person was doing as it was happening and we kind of replicated each other's success and it absolutely happened the same way before we started this podcast you said what topics do you have I'm feeling a little uninspired and I have to say you win a blue ribbon today because you have completely put a beautiful bow tie on this thing that I brought you you brought so many good interesting tidbits to add to the story of Ed Thorp that was pretty good well can I can I leave you with one framework and I have one story so the framework is you know when Ed Thorp was beating blackjack or beating roulette what's the first step that he had to do before he beats the house what is Step absolute Step Zero before he even fig figured out how to beat the house I don't know just how to do it at home believing that it could be done right believing that it could be done and this is cheesy but it is very true and by the way things that are cheesy but true are underrated because smart people ride off cheesy things because they're cheesy because they've heard them before but they haven't actually acted on it so their underpriced assets are things that are cheesy and true because they're ignored by other smart ambitious people I remember when I went to this Tony Robbins event on the second day there's another guy who who hosted so the other guy he starts off with a game of Simon says to kind of warm up the audience and you just think this is a warm up because they want you to be engaged as an audience they want you to be active do something interactive little crowd work to start so he starts with Simon say we're gonna play Simon say now this is a room of about 6,000 people so there's 6,000 people are gonna play Simon Says and he's like the winner gets to come on stage or like that the yeah the the winner gets to come on stage and you're gonna get this thing I forgot what it was some some good prize but again there's 6,000 people so you know whatever good luck so he starts and he says Simon Says blah blah blah and then like he immediately gets like half the people in the first one so for example he goes all right you guys ready to play Stand Up and everybody stands up he says he didn't say Simon Says stand up so you only do the thing when he says Simon says but if he just says an instruction and you do it without saying Simon says you're out this guy clearly read the book The Game exactly so he's got us on the cat String Theory we were just obeying his commands so the game starts half people get out on the first round it whittel it down within five minutes he's down to the winner winner gets up on stage blah blah blah and he had the final 10 people he said stay standing you don't get to come on stage but stay standing and um then he called on somebody he's like the guy who's standing you got to the final 10 the guy next to you when did you get out he's like I got out in like the second round he goes let me ask you something did you believe you were gonna win and the guy was like no I mean so many people it's a silly game I don't know I didn't even think about it he goes that's interesting asked next person did you believe you were going to win no he goes so raise your hand if you when we started the game you believed that you could win only like you know 5% of the audience raise your hand he goes so all of you thought you were competing with 6,000 people the only competition was amongst these 50 people who actually believe that there was a way to win and he's like I'm Gonna Leave You with two two ideas number one if you're GNA play the game decide to win so funny he's like he's like you don't have to win every game but if you decide to play you should decide to win and he goes the second thing is that in life you believe competing with a much bigger pool of people than you actually are because the majority of people aren't even playing the game and of the people who are playing the game most of them don't even believe that they can win you were only competing with the people who actually believe that there is a way to win and so similarly with this guy cracking blackj cracking roulette that's a game I thought was impossible to crack until I read the book I think it's called Bringing Down the House or something like that that's the other Blackjack card counting book and immediately my mind shifted into oh black Che is a beatable game we can beat this game and suddenly I started to learn things suddenly I started to understand how do you actually beat the game of black and it compelled me into action all right let's pause real quick I got to do the thrill of the shill where I'm going to give you a thrill here I'm G to teach you something that I think is a very important principle that any founder should know and I'm GNA tell you about a company that's doing it well all right so the thrill of the shill is have you ever heard of the law of category are you familiar with this I've not I think it's from the book The 22 immutable laws of marketing and in that book it's talking about marketing how do you actually stand out how do you do the hard thing in business which is Stand Out get your brand out there get customers and get them coming to you versus you just chasing them down and hunting them one by one how do you get Market pull and the law of categor is a very simple principle which is that you'd rather own a category than participate in one if you can't be the first in a category you'd rather create a new category Al together and that is something that many people have done so for example I'll give you I'll give you one in the podcasting space so we're we're a podcast and this podcast started off very undifferentiated we started off just as interviews with successful people guess what that's what every business podcast is interviews with successful people how did you do it it's all past past facing how did you do it we started to stand out when me and you got on here we started going a little future facing which is hey what trends what opportunities do you see what's going on right now in the market that you think somebody could be capitalizing on so suddenly we were in a new category so how many podcasts were there that were talking about stuff that you know opportunities and trends that you could be capitalizing on for the next 12 months versus what did you do 15 years ago go successful person and even when we invited gueston we said you got to bring some ideas what opportunities do you see today now we're not just going to ask about the thing you did in the past even further than that is you ever seen hot ones that show where the guy interviews celebrities but instead of just interviewing them they're eating hot wings while they're doing it escalating in in hotness it's the law of category that show became super popular it gets millions of views on YouTube and he gets the best guest because he's the only podcast that does that he's the only show doing that he created his own category and now if you came in and you Tred to do a show like that guess what they would say oh it's kind of like hot ones they own that category they own that that Niche and so the law of category is a very small principle which is that without taking more effort if you simply just Define a new category um you now have a a reason to buy an rtb a reason for a customer to come use your product come use your service well the company that sponsored today's podcast wander is a great example of exactly that these guys basically said well you have luxury hotels you got the four seat you got what's that fancy one Aman that everybody's going to nowadays you got the luxury fancy hotels and then you have stay in a house like Airbnb where you get the home you know you get to stay in a home multiple rooms and a kitchen and all that but it's not as luxury and TurnKey and just a beautiful everything Tak care of you experience so they created a new category which is Hotel aied homes so luxury homes that are on par with the nicest luxury hotels but it's a house instead of being in a building and a sky skyscraper you get a you get a a backyard a pool a sauna you get a kitchen you get everything you want in a home but you get the guarantee that it's going to be luxury unlike an Airbnb so I think that they've done a great job that's why they've grown so fast they did I think like 12 million in bookings in the last 12 months because they created their own category there isn't anybody else who's really in that category where they actually manage the property and therefore can guarantee a certain quality of service great thrill pretty good shill I love the shill improve my shill please no I think your show was great so if you want to use them wander wanderer.com MFM what do

think you said last time I go you know I'm not sure how many people are going to do this so if you're one of the people that actually does it you've got a pretty good chance of actually winning exactly so it's w nde r.com MFM all right back to the episode so I have a funny story I'll tie it up with this which is that people have heard of a vicious cycle oh that's a vicious cycle and they'll say it's you know uh poverty is a vicious cycle you don't have money so therefore or you don't um you can't buy the best food or or or education and therefore you end up staying you know you don't get the best opportunities and therefore you stay poor vicious cycle right we've all heard of vicious cycle well a good thought experiment is what is the opposite of a vicious cycle a virtuous cycle what's a virtuous cycle and a virtual cycle virtuous cycle is again a Tony Robinson is basically if you believe so if you have high conviction that something can happen we've all had moments in our life where we are like I'm convinced that I can do this or that can happen then you'll take a different level of action so belief drives action the amount of belief drives the amount of action so little belief will drive little action which drives a little result a lot of belief takes you to drive take a lot of action which drives a bigger result and guess what once you see that result it reinforces the belief so if you start with a little belief you take a little action get a little result you'll be like I knew it I knew this [ __ ] wasn't going to work it lowers your belief even more takes even lower action lower result and the opposite happens where if you're heavy believer you take a [ __ ] ton of action [ __ ] ton of action will start your yield a result and your belief will say I knew it I knew we could do this I I knew we'd get progress you take even more action and it just becomes a virtual cycle and so that is one of the things that I think is most important if you are stuck or if you're at a plateau or you're not exactly where you want to be Step Zero is you have to somehow trick yourself into raising your level of belief that it is possible one ways to read books about other people who have already done it or talk to other people who have done it imagine yourself doing it whatever ask yourself questions until so you are worked up into a fever that this this is going to work because that's the only chance you have of taking enough action to actually get a result I want to hear from The Listener the people who have made it this far if they feel like I feel right now which is like I want to run through a [ __ ] wall you've just like you're like a guy you're like a pastor right now you know you're like at one of these like black churches where you're like dancing and screaming and [ __ ] and I'm just like in the crowd like dancing as well I feel I get a man yeah so now let me tell you a quick Blackjack story of this so I read this book and I become convinced that we could do this I tell my buddy Trevor I said Trevor we can do this we can bring down the house we can count cards we can get rich off Blackjack he says say no more Trevor's Trevor's a Believer he's down what Perfect part perfect trait of partner being down we're I don't know 21 years old in or senior in college did you read the whole book read the whole book all right but again because we have a ton of belief we find a way to take action I'm living in North Carol there's no casino in North Carolina what am I going to do fly to Vegas no no no the belief drives action the belief causes me to find a way I realize hey in South Carolina there's a river boat and that boat will like boat out into international waters and then you can gamble because it's international waters that's the beauty of the world is you got international waters anything goes so we drive down to South Carolina we get on this Riverboat and we drive out but before we do that we spend three weeks practicing and the same it's the same system you have a counter who's going to be keeping count you have the signaler who's going to signal in the whale so Trevor's the counter Trevor's got the focus I'm the communicator I'm the signal guy and our buddy Dan is gonna be the whale and your signal the whale's job is to come over he's a he's a gregarious character because the the trick when you count cards is you need to wait till the deck is stacked in your favor where there's more let's say Aces and bad the low cards are out so the count is high and then you need to vary your bet size so that's actually how you win is you bet more when the deck is hot you bet less when it's not but if the casino sees you varying your bet like that they kick you out so that's why you need two players you need one guy who's counting and the guy who comes in to make the bet he needs to start with a big bet so he only comes in when the deck is hot and so he comes in and we're like Dan you got to act like a drunken idiot and you're just plopping down your whole stack on this one hand and this you're just gonna then you're gonna double oh screw it we win play it again as long as the deck is hot and when the deck is not hot we're going to Signal you to leave what's your signals to them so we have two signals you have the signal where you're supposed to come over which is basically it was me with my arm like you know kind of like like this position where I want I'm holding my arm like this but I'm behind it's like standing behind me it's hard to do I'm sitting down but just a standing posture so I'm standing behind Trevor Trevor's counting Trevor Has a verbal signal to me so you create a a word for every number so let's say you know the deck is if the count is one which is a very bad count he would just say ah he's just like all right all right unomas unomas like one more hand but that just signals to me the count is one one if there was two he'd be like he'd be like ah [ __ ] balls balls we got two balls that's why there's two and then he'd be like three and he he'd be like you know he' had thing for three and we used like basketball player names and whatever and like we had and you want to get the guy in when the counts like 10 11 12 something like that and he'd be like dude I've had a dozen chances now and so we practice for weeks on this and we're in our dorm room we're skipping class and we're just practicing practicing practiceing signals boom boom boom bets and we're running simulation so we have our friend this girl like who was our friend she was the dealer and she would deal it out we were like every time cleaning up this [ __ ] works and so we drive down to South Carolina we get on the river boat we go Dan's got his drunken drunken tourist costume on Trevor's the the the guy who's just bored he's just sitting there he's betting the minimum but he's counting and I'm the signaler I'm Trevor's buddy and so and so what ends up happening is Count gets hot we get to 10 and um I signal but in the real world conditions are a little different Dan not a lot cuz he's so busy being his drunken character that he's actually acting like an idiot he's not paying attention to anything that we're doing so he's actually getting a drink so he misses 10 count starts to drop but but it's at eight I'm like okay whatever still Eight's still good enough let's signal it might go back to 10 so I signal him Dan sees the signal he starts coming over now our dorm room was kind of small he's at the he's farther away so it takes him a little bit of time by the time Dan gets the table and he tries to cash in his he tries to put down the bet when the counts like you know six or something like that and and he puts his money down they're like well we have to color it up first we have to exchange your cash for chips no beted on this one so the the hand gets dealt out it nukes the count back down to two Dan's hand is visibly shaking I'm like oh God this is not good he cashes in like a th000 wor the chips this is like big money for us so he takes th000 wor the chips he's ready to bet big but the count is now two and Trevor's like balls man ah balls dude and and Dan he's supposed to take ball was he supposed to leave Dan is in he's blacked out at this point he's not drunk and blacked out but he's just got tunnel vision like he's so locked into his character and these stupid things that he's saying to the dealer he's completely ignoring the signal and so he just puts the Thousand do on and we're both like balls balls balls balls B what's happening why are you betting this is the worst time to bet and we just get wiped out in two hands and lost all your money lost all of our money and we were like the book made it seem a lot easier than the B it immediately works and it starts a series of events that just escalates into them being Ballers and um yeah that it's sort of like the game it's kind of the same thing happen with the game okay so we go back home we're licking our wounds we're like damn what the hell man and he's like I'm sorry it was harder in real life we're like all right whatever it's all good man we gotta go the belief was still high that hey there's a way to use Blackjack to make a lot of money so we said you know what screw it what if we're the house until we decide to create an underground Blackjack Club at school where we'll just be the house the these movies go one or two ways now you're on you're on option b for a great movie exactly so we we tried to become the house now we're playing Molly's game basically so we again start running these simulations we're like this is great like the house has an edge we're winning this is like it's a no-brainer so we uh and our friend the whole time was just like you guys are idiots like you've already wasted you know one month of time on the stupid plan number one now you're on stupid plan number two he's like this is an even dumber plan we're like dude what are you talking about we're the house you ever heard about the House's Edge like we can't lose we're the house and he's like okay uh so we're like again two weeks into our like every night we're simulating this we're trying to run like we're like typing Excel like how much money be winning or losing you're not gonna cheat you're just gonna we're just gonna be the house that's it and um so he's like okay watch this so our friend comes in and just like owns us he walks in and he's like all right I want to bet he bets he loses all bet more loses and we're like see told you told you this can work he's like cool and he's like hey give me all my [ __ ] money back we're like no dude he's just like you're gonna give me all my money back right now or and we're like What are you g do beat us up he's like no I'm just gonna call the cops tell me you're running a blackjack ring in your room right now that's actually like a like a you know that's like a serious crime and you're GNA get kicked out of school or you're gonna give me my $800 back and we were like oh yeah we got him the $800 back and we're like damn it yeah you you didn't see the part of uh the scene in Molly's game where she gets beat up for doing this and this guy just instantly pointed out the Fatal flaw which is basically you know this is a crime they can anytime just bust us uh we would have to move the game every week and like somehow know that this guy's not going to screw us over but any player who loses money would always have the ultimate leverage so that's when I learned about leverage and I learned that Leverage is more important than an edge you should have went back to the casino it sounded like this stupid idea actually could have maybe worked if your buddy Dan got a [ __ ] together the reality is that casinos and I I don't know why people don't I mean I guess people do talk about this but casinos use six decks and they use Auto shufflers now and so the ability for the deck to get really hot has been cut down dramatically and so you know they basically use six decks which will smooth out the variants and then they Auto Shuffle and they Shuffle before you get through the whole shoe so the whole point was like you need to get where a lot of the cards have been used there's only a small number of cards left and that that small number of cards is going to have a higher proportion of face cards for you but that just doesn't really happen anymore so I don't really know where the edge is I don't think there's an edge this has been a roller coaster I feel like I I've got my money's worth after listening to this episode and I should have just been learning how to code that whole time in college I should have just been learning how to code and I would have made a lot more money than all of my hairbrain schemes to uh to make money or playing League of Legends one of the two this was very good this was a good episode um is that the pod that's it that's the Pod all right that's the pod [Music]

Telly what's the problem with OIC drugs like OIC and OIC drug OIC the topic OIC what exactly is OIC OIC actually represents to me the biggest issue in the country which is that we're basically being poisoned and then drugged for profit can you explain how OIC actually works essentially it is liquefied anorexia and the problem with recommending it for a long term is that do doctors even have to get go to a nutrition class first day of Stanford med school my sister brought up that somebody with migraines might need to have a dietary intervention her attending surgeon said stop being a [ __ ] we we didn't go to nutrition school is this going to be the most lucrative drug ever made it's the the 12th most valuable company in the world this Danish company they are the largest funder of politicians five times more than the oil industry they're 50% of TV news spending so they're not only able to influence us they're actually able to buy the news itself when I hear Stanford med school Professor or the dean of Harvard Med School are those people that you trust absolutely not the problem is that we're listening to experts remember the food pyramid let's eat our cereals it's the base it's the foundation of your food at my house I think Go-Gurt was like the biggest part of like the pyramid if you don't eat your Gogurt you're not going to get to go play the food pyramid was proed by the sugar research Council still owned by a cigarette company we don't even realize this craft is still owned by Philip Morris we are poisoning our population I just want to do like the 8020 so I feel good and my family is safe and feels good it's like what can I do the biggest lie in healthcare is that the reasons we're getting sick are complicated and the second biggest lie is that these things can't be changed quickly they [Music] can all right let's rock Kelly what's the problem with OIC starting out firing I like it I came on I came on to talk to Sam about this I've got some bows to pick with some of his takes here there's really I think there's a huge problem with OIC which is that there's a shortage and they're not making enough of it all right well I'm glad we're getting right out of the gates here guys so so here's the fundamental Point um I'm not concerned with the 350 pound obese diabetic person like that's between them and their doctor um OIC actually represents to me the biggest issue in the country which is that basically being poisoned and then drugged for profit the largest and fastest growing industry in the country and again largest and fastest growing is the healthcare industry and 95% of those dollars are around drugging and and managing disease of people that are already sick so we've had this explosion of chronic disease kind of siloed treatments and every single one of them relates to more of the disease so st's more heart disease metformin which 30% of people over 40 on I mean it's one of the most widely prescribed drugs right diabetes goes up ssris now 25% of women are in SSR depression and suicide a skyrocketing as more ssris are prescribed literally every single drug you go on the list of every chronic add condition the more it's prescribed the more it goes up so the biggest of them all obesity and you can't even wrap your head around this it's a unique problem in America but 50% of teens overweight are obese I mean that's a moral stain on our country uh the childhood obesity rate in Japan is 3% so we have something unique going on where % of teens are over or obese and then 80% of American adults are over or obese what's the definition of obese is there like a celebrity that you could name that like is like that's like that's like the threshold do I do I need to stand up and take my shirt off and then we just we establish some sort of Benchmark here like is Andy dwire in parks and wreck is that considered obese sometimes um it's actually based on a lot of your this is what my sister and I talk a lot about it's based on your personalized uh biomarkers I mean often times you can be obese and not particularly look that fat uh a lot of us have Brewing metabolic dysfunction 94% of us and the actual definition of obesity isn't even entirely tied to how we look um the the general definition of uh which goes into metabolic dysfunction of something you should be worried about is 35 inch waste for women and 40 inch waste for men though all right so on o zipic um fundamentally we''ve got the this dirty fish tank we've got 80% of American adults right we look at those pictures from the 1960s and look at the pictures they go to a public space there's clearly something happening and it's uniquely happening in America so my my bone to pick with those zic is in the midst of this catastrophe right and this m to clearly something happening with our food um and I think it really relates the fact that 70% of our diet is ultr processed food in Europe and Japan and other countries that's not the case we're clearly doing something and then this system is telling us the answer to that instead of fixing the root cause is a weekly jab for life and the instructions for OIC is a lifetime drug and the most alarming part about it is the American Academy of Pediatrics recently said this is a fully funded uh subsidiary of Pharma um they said that a 12-year-old if your 12-year-old is not only obese but a little bit overweight that OIC should be the first line defense so this is just a representation of I think the biggest issue in the country country which is that we have this explosion of chronic conditions all basically tied to the same thing which is simple dieta lifestyle things and we keep lunging for an injection keep lunging for a pill and my point just Society I actually think it's a big Economic Opportunity is like we are on an unsustainable trajectory like like it's going to be 40% of he uh GDP Healthcare cost in the next 20 years we're becoming truly like a fat and fertile sick depressed population we're destroying our human capital so if we're not going to take the Obesity crisis the fact that you go into a classroom I've got a almost three-year-old you go into a daycare and most kids are clearly having big issues if we're not going to take this moment with obesity and actually ask what's the root cause that's a huge problem and I think the Economic Opportunity and I think one one thing investors and entrepreneurs don't quite see is that if this is an unsustainable situation we're going to have to shift more of that 4.5 trillion dollars to we can we can fix our food system we can incentivize pay lower income people to exercise we can actually do things that incentivize the right things I don't think American the American people are trying to be fat they're not trying to be depressed they're not trying to be unhealthy we actually incentivize them to be and can change those incentives instead of jabbing them with those epics so that's why I think this have you have you tried it no I have not tried it so so let's let's let's unpack that so you basically gave us a gift basket of hot takes there and I just want to open up the ribbon and say oh chocolate cover pretzels wonderful okay so so let's unpack those one by one you said something uh just now you said the fish tank my understanding is you have this analogy where you have a fish tank and the fish are getting sick but you can see that the water is dirty the F the fish tank is not clean and I think your point is we should clean the tank not drug the fish is that the is that the core analogy that you like to use with this yeah I mean let's just go over the stats of that tank right and and I go to kids because I I I'm a you know personal responsibility guy I I really resonant with those arguments that it's people's choice but it's not personal responsibility for kids something's happening and 33% of young adults have pre-diabetes right now 20% of young adults have fatty liver disease right um 40% of high schoolers qualifies as having a mental health a doctor 40 years ago would would would kids have pre-diabetes and fatty liver a doctor would not see one case of a child having diabetes 40 years ago um it it is it is order of magnitude increase this is an absolute unprecedented step function increase in metabolic Health disorders among children a 100 years ago my sister Ry said this 100 years ago if you were obese if you were visibly very fat you were in the circus just literally in a textbook it was so rare for an American they're not that big either yeah like the the the fat man in the in the freak shows they're not they're not that fat compared to what I what you see like on a regular basis right so so literally it was so rare for an adult to be obese 100 years ago they literally their job then was to be in a circus um the explosion Dr Robert lustic who's one of my heroes who led uh hormone issues and and diabetes research at UCSF he said early in his career you know 30 40 years ago didn't see one child one child walk in with diabetes again right now it's 33% of young adults have freebs so we've we've done something to ourselves right and what's happened there is my sister graduating from Stanford med school you choose between 42 Specialties like every doctor she did head and neck and then you do a fellowship Focus even more in that space you know there's Cardiology neurology we we segmented the body that's very profitable because a kid right a kid with pre-diabetes when we segment it when we say oh that's a metformin right then they inevitably have high cholesterol it's a separate doctor the cardiologist that's a Statin they inevitably have some mental health issues SS s they have high blood pressure ace inhibitor they have fertility issues inevitably shove them into IVF and invasive procedures infertility skyrocketing which is highly related to this so they go in this treadmill and they've been lied to that everything's segmented the biggest mistake we've made since World War II is that we've segmented these chronic lifestyle conditions when they're really the same thing all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we' give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copyrighting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show didn't that segmentation come from Rockefeller yeah isn't that one of your one of your your research points yeah so and this gets to like kind of the business angle is is that all of these things we're in this game when it comes to our health which is highly meditated um the way medicine exists today the The Guiding law in Congress is called the flexner report which actually mandates that we can't look at disease holistically we have to look at things in silos evidence-based we need to name a condition and then treat it with either a surgery or a pill this is enshrined in law what what was their re I mean maybe there was a good reason why they did that like if you had to make the argument for why that was a good reason if you if you could what was their reasoning well flexer who wrote that report in uh 1909 so it's still the guiding law today was a paid lawyer of Rockefeller who invented the pharmaceutical industry as byproducts of oil production he figured he could make them into certain uh pharmaceutical cures so he is the father of the modern pharmaceutical industry and the funer of our top Med schools like John Hopkins and he did see Economic Opportunity in basically professionalizing medicine siloing conditions and making money by by treating um I think there's a way you could spend that in a positive way I mean it was the wild west and a lot of witch doctors out there and I think in their minds they were trying to make it more professionalized but there was a clear Economic Opportunity to name and Silo conditions um and then profit from the intervention not from making people healthy and there was a very clear you know you look at John Hopkins uh the guy that started that school William Hallstead he denigrated nutrition denigrated any type of holistic thinking to this day in medical education when my sister brought up that somebody with migraines might need to have a dietary intervention her attending surgeon said stop being a [ __ ] we we didn't go to nutrition school this kind of idea of d minimizing any exploration um first day at Stanford med school uh Casey uh was told by her professors that the American patients are not going to stop uh eating their Big Macs they're that they're going to be sedentary and that the best thing we can do is stand with serious medicine with the Prescription Pad you know with the scalpel um and treat these conditions as they pop up that is like so viscerally ingrained into the medical system and and and that's lie do doctors even have to get go to a nutrition class like isn't it isn't it like uh like they they study that very minimally 90% of medic 90% of doctors graduate without taking one nutrition class to this this day I was Premed four four years of Premed Zero nutrition zero in exercise and I remember uh asking my teacher because I was like this is a little strange like we took an anatomy class right you take a ton of chemistry organic chemistry all this stuff but you never take anything on nutrition or exercise um and I remember asking about that and they I was like does this happen later like did I miss it what what's going on here and uh they were like no it's just not part of the curriculum there your teacher was also like don't be a [ __ ] Sean that's just like look he's like this your Premed and not men uh all right so I just want to read some of these the the these stories I I pulled from your your blog here so you it said that in 19 1909 this is what you're talking about medicine was the Wild Wild West at the time the fourth most prescribed drug in the country was uh probably heroin right or uh cocaine heroin heroin it was it was made by berer or Bayer I don't know how you say them uh and it was it was a a cure for finicky behavior in infants so that's good um then it says that rockfeller helped start the modern pharmaceutical industry by using oil byproducts so John D Rockefeller obviously oil uh you know magnet he then needed a byproduct for his oil uh and said okay how are we going to sell Pharmaceuticals well if we fund mod modern Educational Systems I didn't realize that John Johns Hopkins is named after him yeah he's the father of modern medicine education yeah yeah he also uh founded uh University of Chicago that's right so it was a radical concept at the time to Silo different diseases into different categories so that doctors could prescribe drugs for each of those those diseases um and is it true that seed oils were also from uh from Rockefeller yeah I mean you really these these system is by Design and uh another thing he did is he had this basically oil lubricant you know cheaply made from from byproducts of of seeds and he saw that he could actually Lobby the USDA and get those approved for human consumption they're much cheaper than the natural fats that we're you know genetically biologically made to eat and now by basically rigging the regulatory system having his lawyers literally on the regulatory panels um it's the top source of American calories is is literally it's just as a statement of fact a byproduct of oil production these these seed oils um and we're wondering what's going on to our health the three key pillars of the American diet were foods that didn't exist 120 years ago um you know processed sugar refined sugar wasn't really a thing that really came out of the scene um about a 100 years ago we now eat a h 100 times more sugar than we did 100 years ago it's it's it's truly weaponized our food seed oils the top of American calories were a byproduct from John D Rockefeller new invention and then process grains the processing really took off after World War II to make the grain shelf stable but take the processing take taking that fiber off makes most of the grains we eat right it's it's basically a hidden sugar um it's very little nutritional value which the fiber has um and actually turns into sugar in our bloodstream makes it more addictive those are the pillars of the American diet that were just fundamentally uh aren't biologically made to eat and you know one thing to add to the conspiracy add to the story but but it's true is cigarette companies invented the processed food industry so you have JY Rockefeller kind of starting it but then in the 1980s the cigarette smoking started going down uh Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds became the two largest food companies in the United States uh in 1990 two of the three largest m&a deals in American history were cigarette companies buying food companies so every single processed food companies we can actually point to he's either still owned a cigarette company we don't even realize this craft is still owned by Philip Morris um so these cigarette compan is actually still owned or has been sput off once the doctors and the scientists from the cigarette companies went to the food companies and actually us these ingredients used the rig system to actually make our food more addictive so this isn't just an accident that we're getting sick and and Sam you know maybe we're talking at different levels because you know on the micro level you know OIC there's there's good stories and bad stories but on on the high level and where where we're really you know kind of the purpose of my life is to argue this is we have $1,800 per month that taxpayers are going to pay for OIC for an 80% us adult target market what if we actually just took the issue obesity and just from first principles asked how do we actually solve that problem you'd never say wait for people to get sick and then jab 80% of American people uh we're we're so in this box of just as an it's inevitability that we're going to get sick even though we get much sicker than other countries and then drug people we're so in that box it's like heresy to even question that we're going to do that and we should give the listener and Sean background basically uh we we had a discussion on Twitter Cai about OIC I actually don't remember what I said but uh I think uh how convenient well I it was something I was like Pro OIC but for people who were uh incredibly obese because I think that like I I I just think that when people say that something is always bad I'm like well that's not true like it could be good in some cases now um I think that uh drugs are mostly not the answer but occasionally are I tested OIC because I'm a guinea pig and I love testing weird things um I think that like some of the things that for Mor the obese people is interesting I think it's particularly interesting for alcoholics but for the average Joe no I think it's silly um and I I I'd imagine you and I are in huge agreement on that how long did you take it for Sam I I took it I I tested it for 3 months when when it was like like when I saw that it was like the coolest or when I saw that I read an article saying like everyone in the Hamptons or the Rich and Famous are taking this I think I told you about it Sean in 2021 and I was like what is this drug it limits like your blood glucose stuff like that's interesting so I tried it and it was uh it kind of makes you sick at first but it's it's a spectacular drug but if you don't need it it's definitely not something that you should take diet andt exerc is way better can you explain I don't know how much you know but can you explain how OIC actually works what does it do that lets you that that causes the weight loss uh what is the function or what is like the the pathway that it uses yeah I mean it so so the truth is we don't fully actually know all the mechanisms but glp1 is a uh our body actually produces it and it gives us the feeling of sa so it actually is basically just a supplement that's jamming our body with more of this peptide um it's like taking a bunch of vitamin D or taking another supplement you're basically taking a supplement of a peptide that our body naturally produces to trick our body into feeling full um so you know again that that's not really solving the root cause a couple quick points to what Sam says I think we're in full agreement I think the drug should be available I think people should be able to hack with it you know but Scott Galloway was recently talking to you guys I think I think he mentioned this he said this is the biggest a bigger Economic Opportunity for the country than AI he said that the vast majority of American people should be on this that's the stance of the medical community The Stance of the various medical associations and the FDA is that this drug should be prescribed to the median American basically that it's so hopeless that we're so addicted to ultra processed food that we need to stimulate ourselves with the peptide in order to trick ourselves into feeling full essentially it is liquefied anorexia I mean truly truly that's what it is it's it's it's it's making you not want to eat it's a crash diet and the problem with recommending it for a long term is that if you if you could prove perfectly that this thing works the rest of your life with zero side effects is totally okay for every American to take for the rest of their lives maybe there'd be a conversation but that's actually not true people are getting off this at high rates because of the side effects uh there's very little long-term information there was a 68 we study to approve it for kids for life actually but we don't know the long-term effects um you mentioned not wanting to drink Sam I mean there's increasing information coming out and this is a a key point with large with the healthcare system is that you know why is it not making people want to do anything they enjoy doing it's not it's if they say it's actually making people not want to have sex not want to gamble not want to drink obviously this drug affects your dopamine and serotonin Pathways um and it's actually increasingly showing that it's highly tied to suicidal aition and depression one of the problems with the siloing of healthare this again and I want to be really clear with chronic conditions um the acute Innovations of the medical system if we have an infection gunshot wound burst of pinic complicated childbirth that's great but that's five to s% of overall spending the vast majority of the medical system is basically pilling and putting Band-Aids on chronic conditions and um people should be able to hack this I think it's great Sam took a lot of my friends are taking it but the problem is it's going to be $1800 of government funding per person per month uh that's rigged too uh the $800 it's 15 times cheaper in Europe the drug is 15 times cheaper in its home country and throughout Europe uh through totally dysfunctional rigged policies we're actually lit literally paying 15 times more as taxpayers uh for that drug so so that's why I think it's kind of the Rosetta Stone to understanding why we're kind of losing our way uh Sam have you ever done the napkin math on this drug so I kind of was doing this this morning about this $1,800 a month well do you know how you know how much it cost Sean like when I bought it just like for fun yeah I did it for fun uh it was like 800 bucks a month I think just real quick on that they give rebates to individuals but the system is so rigged that the sticker price is6 to 18800 which Medicare and Medicaid uh will pay so the government's actually going to pay a lot more taxpayers would actually pay a lot more and then they give rebates uh to individuals paying out of pocket but so so if you just use 20 20,000 a year as the the cost to take this thing because it's a long-term drug you're supposed to take it continuously and then it's 80% I believe of adults are you know in the sort of like qualified uh you know that's the T basically for this so you take you know you take the US population times 80% times 20 grand a year and then you're like well you're supposed to continue to take this thing so even if you do like you know so so just that alone is something like two or three trillion dollars a year it's insane and then you then you say great and then they're going to take this for 20 30 years oh interesting so this is a 50 trillion drug Cali is this going to be the most lucrative drug ever made well right now that's priced into the stock so I think it's the the 12th most valuable company in the world and Nova Nordic is the company that makes it just pasted lvmh you know the iconic fashion designer as the most valuable company in Europe you know how like Safeway or Kroger has like a CVS where you can get your your drugs in the in the grocery store that's kind of like what Louis Vuitton does now I think like at the front desk they like upsell you on exactly they're TR together but um but yeah Sean it's certainly priced in with the stock I mean this thing is a phenomenon it's one of the most valuable companies in the world what's interesting when you look into the I I've actually dug into the JP Morgan analyst reports that actually underly the assumptions for why the stock is so valuable about 80 to 90% of the profits expected are not from its home continent Europe it it's it's almost all from the United States so this is not the standard of care in in Europe if you're pre-diabetic in in Denmark where this drug is made they actually prescribe a keto diet they actually pay you to exercise um which makes sense um this isn't just gold out like candy uh from the medical system in Europe people can pay out of pocket so all the profit expectations are coming from the United States this Danish company is one of the 10 largest lobbyists of us politicians and one of the 10 largest Spenders on TV news um so literally what you have is Pharma companies just just as a statement of fact not conspiratorial they are the largest fund of politicians they fund politicians directly five times more than the oil industry they're 50% of TV news spending so they're not only able to influence us they're actually able to buy the news itself they're actually able to dictate what we hear on the news which is why 60 uh literally ran a segment saying obesity is a genetic condition uh that it's not tied to eating or not tied to exercise and that it's it's an urgent priority to uh jab a bunch of kids that's what literally what 60 Minutes said relatively un questioned and they're the largest funer of Med schools in academic research I mean getting back to the nutrition point in Med schools Casey kind of Unwound why that was Stanford med school 50% of their budget touches Pharma Pharma is the number one funer of research um Pharma is the number one fun of the actual Regulatory Agencies 50 excuse me 75% of the FDA is actually not funded by taxpayers it's funded by Pharma itself and bureaucracies are built to grow it's a evolving door when I hear Stanford med school Professor or the dean of Harvard Med School that just feels like trustworthy to me just me as a Layman person I feel like well who else am I going to trust if not the dean of Harvard Med or this Stanford Professor are those people that you trust absolutely not I I think around the country in various levels we're all losing trust in our institutions in various ways the military education Healthcare I think is number one and I think this is a really positive thing because the we're the only animals with experts telling us what to eat and you know how to manage chronic conditions we're the only animals that have rampant levels of metabolic dysfunction obesity diabetes you already have those among drafts like the problem is that we're listening to experts and let me just let me just take it really specific on Stanford scho D you're right nobody more trusts in the country and working for the pharmaceutical industry in 20 2009 2010 we knew that well can you just explain that you were you were a consultant right you you went to Stanford then you became a consultant and you consulted four companies like can you just explain that background I went to Stanford my sister was my best friend she was much smarter she was pre-ad you know top of her Stanford bed school class I did economics and got into politics and then right after doing some campaigns realized you know everyone that after the campaign works for the two largest Spenders in D see the food industry and the Pharma industry worked for them and and did Consulting for a couple years didn't like it got went to business school and been starting companies for the past 10 years did you know getting into it were you like this is slimy so I grew up in washingt DC good young conservative you know intered at the White House entered at Heritage Foundation I was the annoying conservative guy in class at Stanford pissing every it off and you know really consider myself very ideological and I considered being conservative supporting American industry so I worked on some campaigns and then I was very proud to be working for the pharmaceutical industry and working for the food industry these industries leading the country and the issue in front of us was which ties to the Stanford med school dean was opioids so you get in a room I'm a junior employee and it's like there's unnecessary regulation on opioids these incredible innovations that are solving this scorge of the American people which is pain and we have to fight back against this what are we going to do and I had a list of doctors in front of me and we're like how do we get these doctors money let's get them some research grants so we reached out to the dean of Stanford med school who is a pain specialist and we funded him directly with Consulting payments and then made a donation to Stanford to his lab for $4 million from OPI companies to study ethics and Pain Management then we worked with our allies at the NIH which is totally just a swamp with pharmaceutical interest it's funded by Pharma it's a total roling door and we help set up a panel so the NIH in 2011 did a panel to make recommendations on opioids who's the most trusted person you could possibly have on a panel to make a medical recommendation the dean of Stanford med school so the dean of Stanford med school who just took a bunch of money from over companies was appointed in 2011 to the Blue Ribbon panel on opiod recommendations he chose 19 other Elite academics 15 of the 19 had direct payments from opioid companies that we very strategically steered to them and that panel in 200 I believe it's 2011 recommended basically that this was overblown about the addiction they basically said you know stay the course pain is a huge problem and then opard uh prescriptions continue to go up that's how it works and I can just tell you I think this is something people are waking up to I think you see this in the political climate right now where there's I think the defining issue of our time is distrust of our institutions um the these lobbyists these Consultants they know how to rig the debate right they know people trust a study from Stanford they know people trust you know what civil rights groups say that if you call someone racist that's going to shut down the debate so that's why corporations that are basically poising the American people are the biggest funder of civil rights organizations you it's just look who people trust and funnel them money to so let let me ask you when you when you funded the research for let's say that Stanford uh Professor or Dean or whatever it was and then they and you funded 15 of the 19 people that were on that panel now I want to get really specific do you think what do you believe do you believe that they genuinely believed the opioid like that that was their con there were genuine conclusion after doing the research and the study was that the opioid thing is overblown and we should pay more opioids for Americans right do you believe that they felt like a little conflicted like hey my gravy train shuts off if this goes down so let's find some Middle Ground do you feel like they are intentionally misleading or that that's genuinely what they believe very very good question I think the reason maybe a lot of listeners and I used to have trouble believing this is because how can this be so evil so let me break this down the genius of the Health Care system is that it takes very good people and puts them into a system with plausible deniability so the problem is that nobody actually has full responsibility for why the outcome that the Healthcare System should be solving for which is people getting sick why that's exploding as everyone's making money you know the doctors can say it's the food company's fault the food companies can say it's personal respons responsibility the med schools can say we can't control what Americans do we're just going to keep growing and making money the Pharma companies you know rally about you know making STS and curing the sick patients in front of them so everyone the the systemic design of of the healthcare industry is is actually genius um because it can allow people actually almost virtue signal about doing the right thing while producing um well not not necessarily evil it's evil but but it's producing what the systems designed to do which is growth so that's one Dynamic with the healthcare system if you go down to your question Sean and I've really Casey's been exploring this we talk about this in our book I have to put some culpability on people in the system and I think it's breaking through one statistic that's alarming doctors have the highest suicide rate and highest rate of burnout of any profession America I think what's happening is you get a lot of well-meaning people there's easier ways to make a buck you know than the nine years of training you have to do you know people we actually are a magnet for the best and brightest into the medical system and then they eventually realize and if they're not they don't realize this they're just not paying attention that they're complicit in a system that is profiting from people being sick and they're not making people better so you actually have a dynamic where a lot of people feel trapped uh my sister after leaving kind of bravely leaving the medical system after a decade of training got people senior at Stanford senior at Harvard senior medical leaders kind of talking to her off the Record saying you are much braver than me everyone knows this system is going to run the country off a cliff so there is a knowledge and I think what this depression suicide burnout among doctors is they don't quite know what to do uh they they feel really trapped um in this system with with with really perverse incentives but we all know people that work at Pharma that are doctors you know a lot of my friends from Harvard Business School like they go into work at Pepsi work at Pharma work at these companies it takes good people um but but I more and more I do you know think we need to kind of that Elon Musk energy you know when he said [ __ ] it I don't care if I lose money I'm going to do what's right I we need more of that leadership from the healthcare system because we're truly creating a and I'm not even joking right a a a fat depressed infertile population I mean infertility is is skyrocketing right now there's our bodies are screaming out for help right well before we go to infertility I want to just tie back to the history thing so you had said something I think in one of your blog posts that the first chronic condition that pharmaceutical ever that that became a pharmaceutical product was birth control I think this was in the 1950s and you said this is the first pill in American history that people just did didn't stop taking right and you know if you're a company and you see this it's a beautiful business model here's a pill they're going to take every single month you know on an ongoing basis and it's not you know it's not a cure it's a treatment it's it's a chronic thing that you're going to continue to do and um I think there's some documentaries now on the Sackler family and all this but uh you know basically they worked for fiser and they started thinking you know how can we create more chronic issues and they is it true that they also owned the medical journals at the time yes so let me yeah let me try to take that to today and what kind of the business problem and the business opportunity is so you're right um the medical system was at its height of trust after World War II the invention of antibiotics was credited as a chief reason we won the war you know but the antibiotics were founded by you know basically somebody digging in dirt and doing some like very rudimentary experiments that cost no money right it's like this wasn't actually a huge industry um and literally the sac family they they said okay this is very strategic let's take the trust and gendered postwar War Two let's learn the lesson from the birth control pill and let's get Americans on more and more pills so they actually with owning the medical journals they actually created new diagnosis codes and created this idea of anxiety and created new mental health code categories and their first big Blockbuster one of them was uh Valium a benzos very addictive very harmful and The Time Magazine cover you know late 1960s early 1970s was valum Nation uh 30% of women were on this drug very addictive they were called mom Mommy's Little Helper and that was their advertising and and then you just go down the list the entire thrust of medicine has then been to take that Flex report take what Rockefeller set up and put on hyperdrive segment the body segment Medical Specialties deeper deeper deeper and then create pills just for biomarkers right Stan for for cholesterol right the metformin for blood sugar we've been we've been pilling ourselves on all these little biomarkers that we can kind of manipulate with one pill completely ignoring that everyone's getting sicker at the same time that is by the design right it's very profitable we you know we I think we talked about this on Twitter just as a statement of economic fact there's nothing more profitable than a child that gets sick early and gets on these drugs and doesn't learn metabolically healthy habits doesn't learn the basics of why their blood sugar is high why their cholesterol is high they're told the saviors is a pill and they're inevitably going to get more and more and more and more comorbidities The Genius of chronic disease which the saos understood is that those patients suffer those kids suffer right you're you're you're four times more likely to be suicidal or depressed if you have diabetes as a kid right you're you're going to have a lot more issues like infertility but you don't die right away you you you're you're a patient who goes in the system often paid for by taxpayers so this was understood this is directly understood when the sackers and and other allies saw the birth control pill and that takes us to today where I I I'll call out you know even the entrepreneurial Comm community and venture capitalist right investment and and and and uh good business opportunities in the system still are predicated on this existing model you know I talked to a lot of esteemed Healthcare VCS and they think Innovation is putting a millennial pink package on Viagra and and and shipping it to people uh more conveniently they think that Innovation is like better ux on medical records you know you you look down the list on these thought leaders of vigal capital talking about you know medical Innovation it's all just better wrappers on the same existing system there's very little disruption now that's a moral problem but I actually think it's an economic problem because I don't think people fully understand I've talked to a lot of lot of lot of this wise people in the in the health space um if we have an unsustainable situation if we truly do believe that if we truly do believe we're on a bad path with our mental health with our physical health with our obesity rates we're not going to drug our way out of that problem like we're not going to be doing more and more the same to solve that problem I think that's self-evident and I think there's an Economic Opportunity there for people who realize it because we're going to have to to to shift the incentives of the system hey so I don't I don't want to change the world when it comes to food that's up to guys like you I just want to do like the 8020 where I mostly do things great so I feel good and I look good and my family is safe and feels good as well can you tell me what you eat and where you get your food on a daily basis and just what that 8020 is like what can I do what can our listeners do what can Sean do to just be mostly great yeah the core thesis of of this book I wrote with my sister is that things are more complicated by Design the biggest lie in healthcare is that the reasons we're getting sick are complicated and the second biggest lie is that these things can't be changed quickly they can so when it comes to food I believe we should fire every single person in the government and Academia who works in nutrition we should replace it with this one rule which is which answers your question and one principle reduce ultr processed food consumption we are 70% if you look at what your kids are eating or what we're eating it's it's Ultra processed food so what what what did you what did you eat for breakfast and what are you going to eat for lunch no matter what dietary philosophy you are I try to eat Whole Foods I had eggs right pasture raise so to look look into the quality so the first step is to reduce Ultra Food consumption that's the thing I'd say first and foremost that is what most people are not doing even if you don't get into the the type of types of food you're eating that's the first step I guarantee you if you are on the hunt to rid your uh fridge of ultra processed food being on the hunt for those three those Unholy Trinity of three ingredients added sugar processed grains and Seed oils you're going to get to the next level with the quality of the food the first thing to do it's all to processed food so which basically just means uh mostly uh plants and animals that uh are are not processed a ton if we simply made that our nutrition policy we'd be a transformed human capital the second thing is as you alluded to is if you get there and most people are not there is to get into the quality food to really understand and be curious and be be in that path of what's being done to our food the genetic makeup of a grass-fed cow versus a grain-fed cow is entirely different it's a reverse ratio of Omega-3 or Omega 6 the grain fed which cows are not made to eat which is totally a new phenomenon are predominantly Omega six fatty acids which are inflammatory which which which causes inflammation in our body a grass-fed cow which is how they've been raised forever um which is now a luxury is omega-3 anti-inflammatory so if you just hunt for Animals hunt for um vegetables that were made in the way were biologically you know made to eat them that's that's the second bar but all right so I'm hungry do you go to uh like a chain grocery store ever or do you only go to Butcher where where do you shop for groceries I go to Sprouts I go to Whole Foods I look for deliveries of meat that's pasture raised of farmers that I trust but truly um just going to your supermarket and not getting Ultra processed food and looking with the eggs pasturised with the meat ideally grass-fed pasture raised um with the vegetables organic not sprayed with a bunch of glyphosate and pesticides like it's simple it's it's the things we all talk about but if you if you truly just follow that um and incentivize that as a country more we'll be on a much better path what are your vices when's the last time you had a Dorito yeah or like just like like do you have a bowl of ice cream once a week I am like every everyone that knows me I am like I've been on a journey here guys like you know two years ago I mean I was running a a wedding dress company with my wife a direct consider were wedding dress company during Co we we raised Venture money we had a large team it it struggled a bit during Co it's called anomaly we made custom dresses we had a really Innovative supply chain but you know I've been running you know startups direct consumer companies um you know for the past decade and I wasn't the iiest person and during covid a couple things happened one is my sister Casey means who I wrote the book with as I mentioned a bun she started levels Health she left the medical system she's become a big Advocate I thought she was an idiot when she left medical school or left residency I'm I I you know as I said grew up trusting the medical system uh thinking it was just crazy that she would leave this path she's on of all these credentials right that's how we were raised it's like get get the best schools get grow up the traditional systems um so I thought she was crazy but she really radicalized me with these ideas um that the answers are much simpler than than they seem in 2021 as we were selling our direct consumer company my mom had a pain in her stomach and uh and went in to get a scan uh at staford hospital and she was perfectly healthy we thought but they told her it was stage four pancreatic cancer and she called us said I was gonna she's goingon to die in a couple weeks and we rushed to her side what that experience for me so this is relatively new this is 2021 what that experience to me showed is really a microcosm of how the system is broken because my mom was on five medications over 40 years um she you know 30 years ago had high cholesterol stat in that's normal high blood sugar metform and that's normal so she was the typical American patient she was 70 and actually told by our doctor a couple weeks before that she was actually healthy because she was on less medications than an average 7-year-old because those issues that most Americans deal with weren't identified as a core you know metabolic issue just take a pill she wasn't set on that path of exploring her food of understanding how sedentary life can can eventually give you cancer down the road that led to her getting cancer this year cancer rates are at an all-time high they're particularly at an all-time high around kids every single chronic disease you can name is at an all-time high this year it's because we're ignoring the warning signs we ignored those with my mom so she abruptly died and that kind of radicalized me to my previous experience uh working for the food and Pharma industry right around that time I took a blood test and the doctor said oh your blood is fine you know you're fine I showed my sister she's like no no this is this represents metabolic dysfunction um I asked the doctor again what happened they're like no no no you're not treatable yet you're not quite at the St rate but yeah yeah that's it's not good but you know we don't have anything to do for you yet so that's that kind of these experiences it doesn't come from a passion for nutrition it comes from a passion really for American competitor um we are poisoning our population and the the average American is on a path like by Mom kind of the system hand waving these small things and they eventually lead to a big thing so that led me I mean I'm not a model in any way and frankly I don't have any interest in lecturing anyone listening um I think we a lot of people listening are on probably a path right now my main passion and what Justin and I are really working on Justin Mayers my partner at trumb is I I think I think a lot of your listeners are on this path I think they're like looking at Pat race beef I think they're trying what I'm saying and where my experience comes in from working for these Industries is that we can't lie to ourselves though we are not going to get out of this if the largest industry in the country is incentivized for us to be sick and I think startups companies very other people we need to actually talk about the top down incentives too so you know I'm absolutely on a path we've written about tactical tips on our our book but where I'm spending most my time is like how do we change the incentives because I don't think the Japanese kids are you know just a much less lazy and less suicidal than Americans at a 3% % you know they have a 3% obesity rate we have a you know kid childood obesity rate like 25% there's something happening with the what what is the answer there what what what is the leading theory on why in Japan they're at you look at this chart we're at 40% yeah America we're number one 40% obesity rate and then Japan's at the bottom 4% what are they doing differently what do you is it you know genetic might be a hypothesis what are the real hypothesis no anyone that said genetics they they say obesity crisis is genetics when it's just exploded in the past 40 years and was not an issue at all they say they say that diabetes is genetics when you didn't have kids as diabetic 40 years ago Sean it is so simple it is follow the money it is that simple it is I'm just gonna say this again our most prominent industry makes money when we're sick and loses money when we're healthy what does Japan do yeah so they spend three times less per capita uh on Healthcare and double the amount mostly on food so so per capita so so they actually put food into their Healthcare budget so I'll say that again they spend two t work capita on food we spend almost like on all developed countries per capita we spend the least amount on food and three times more than the are you saying the government spends two times more country a country and a lot of the healthcare budget actually goes to incentivizing the food system and food interventions nine out of tenen killers of Americans are food Bor illnesses I mean we can dance throughout it it's just that simple like you would wipe out heart disease diabetes kidney disease respiratory illness covid deaths even if you got our country metabolically more healthy which is many factors but food is the number one other countries understand that and they dramatically re in in incentives that pay doctors more when you get sicker for a longer period of time fundamentally D structure now a lot of these countries I don't even have systems we fully agree with that you know socialism whatever have you in the US we have much worse than socialism we have a kleptocracy where the system's just totally been rigged at every single impulse is for people to get sick be fed into the system and then stay sick to be treated that's every single impulse in the system Sean have you um have you ever you you I don't think you've been to Europe recently um but when you go to Europe it's pretty crazy I um you like I I went down this little path where I remember going to Europe and I felt like I ate poorly like I was on vacation and I ate pretty bad but I was walking a lot but I felt awesome and I went to the store and I bought a pack of Skittles just a I wanted to look at the ingredients and then when you compare the amount of ingredients that are in a Skittle or a Kit Kat or like normal junk food compared to American food it's like the list of ingredients it's like two or three times as long I've seen this on Twitter right same brand of bread or whatever it is same brand of cracker but then in Europe there's three ingredients and in the US there's 17 ingredients that you don't recognize the names that's what you're talking about yeah and there's this other thing where if you look at McDonald's so McDonald's up until like 1985 or 1990 they used beef fat I believe to fried their fries tallo and it was I think it was just salt and a potato for a long time now if you look at the ingredients of a french fry it's a McDonald's french fry it's it's got like 10 other things is there and I think that someone said said it best where they said in Europe the rules around food are it's a default too we say no to everything here's the ingredients we allow you to put in whereas in America it was like here's the here's the handful of things we don't allow call you're rolling your eyes is that inacurate to look at it because I've noticed that when I go overseas I often times I feel better but I don't think I'm eating better no no I think you're hitting it on this Ted Sam I'm I'm just anticipating what I would be thinking a couple years ago what some people might be thinking is there's this argument when you talk about this in the US that it's overregulation and again I'm like a free market guy I don't like regulation and as a working for these companies whenever anyone mentioned about changing food inrees the US it's like the US Food system is great let's not have the NY State the problem is that the nanny state is the fact that food companies have lobbied and rigged the system to have thousand we literally thousands of ingredients that aren't legal in Europe are allowed in the United States the USD nutrition guidelines committee which basically approves and recommends various Foods 95% of it is funded by uh 95% of the panelists are directly funded by food companies or farmer companies so this idea that we allow these ingredients isn't under regulation it's actually completely and utterly rigged you know Justin Meers and I we we have a company that is trying to change these incentives but because we've been pounding this Mission we've been looped into a number of advocacy efforts one thing we're doing we're working with a guy named Jason karp um and a bunch of uh Health leaders we we've done a legal action against Kelloggs uh you know Kelloggs is a stark example but their ingredient list they change completely for the American Kids versus just across the border in Canada um it has addictive ingredients it has the colorings that make it really bright that are linked to ADHD um and other developmental issues um we're we're we're literally through a rigged system you know our reformulating ingredients for American kids that's what Europe frankly realizes more I mean what Europe and and other countries are doing is it's not really even Health Care policy it's uh let's not poison our population as much policy Kelly I want to shift gears real quick um you we ask people before they come on the Pod we say you know what were some of the big um you know either philosophies turning points in your life things that that really shaped you and and and shaped the way you think about the world you said something that the most formative experience was a a HBS class so Harvard Business School class where a professor said that the most depressed group of people he ever studied was HBS people 10 years after graduation um what is that story and why would Harvard Business School grads 10 years later be the most depressed group of people yeah it kind of made me think about the Scott Galloway interview you guys did where he's like you know don't chase your passions I just I really don't think that's the right advice I don't think we have an epidemic of people you know not you know fully I don't think we have an epidemic of people chasing their passions too much um you know what I've generally seen um is a lot of our trauma and expectations from society you know throwing really good human capital into suboptimal roads um and yeah so HBS and it's just one microcosm you know but but just something I saw everyone writes their application essay about you know transforming and disrupting the world disrupting Health Care disrupting you know energy big Industries having a big impact and then like many things you you get into that room of you know of a thousand people of kind of a type people and uh it's a Conformity Factory um so 85 to 90% of people by the end of the two years end up going into traditional Industries into Finance into energy you know my friend person who wrote an essay about transforming Healthcare went to McKenzie and you know I was on the team that uh helped prescribe more opioids on their side that that recently had to settle lawsuit so so you have this Dynamic I think this happens at many layers throughout the country where um based on you know various fears that are ingrained in Us by Society I think frankly the gears of one of the negative Gears of capitalism to just kind of you know as John D Rockefeller said we need workers we don't need thinkers um you know that's what a lot of our institutions do and um this study uh this professor uh he surveyed white uh blue collar workers different socioeconomic classes you know different professions you know like like 30 different cohorts the most depressed group was these graduates 10 years out and again the reason is because they go in with dreams they end up conforming and settling their lifestyle gets to the point where they don't have really flexibility to take that stab to take that dream they feel professionally unfulfilled but trapped and then you know 10 years out they really have a lot of regrets at least professionally but that maybe bleeds into other areas and um you know I I I generally feel like like grateful honestly like like I in a weird way my mom's death was always what I'd feared most in life that happening and in a way kind of cementing the finiteness of life and um and and and a mission into my head um I feel really like grateful for and um yeah I I think people not chasing their passions not fully self-actualizing themselves is a much bigger problem than uh than too many people following their passions you also said that uh taking mushrooms um was like one of the most impactful things did you tell Cali your almost mushrooms Story one of my favorite stories listen to this so you know I I I have issues that I'm always working out I had some I had some trauma I was working out and I and I went to this I went to this meeting of this woman who she called herself a shaman was going to lead me along with my wife through a MDMA or something like that therapy session I go to the dinner and the meet and greet and she starts saying things like we need to give this medicine for free to every one and I was like yeah but I'm paying like 5 grand to do this can I have it for free she didn't like that and then she was like she asked where I was from I said Missouri and she goes uh fly over country uh and I was like all right that's strike too and then I start asking her a little bit more and she starts talking about capitalism and how it's ruined medicine and capitalism's horrible and all this stuff I'm like little lady again I'm paying you five grand a be here and I was like so what were you doing before this she goes I used to work at Leman brothers and when it collapse I left and started doing this and I was like I'm out lady I'm out and she and she texted me she texted me and she was like I don't think this is a good fit and I was like I agree this is this is a a a round pig and a square uh hole this is not a good fit didn't you tell her you're like I can't do drugs with you yeah I was like look I was already on the on the fence about taking drugs and if I'm going to take drugs it ain't gonna be with you so and you said that taking siloc was was awesome Sean have you ever done this stuff by the way and would you ever I've only done it like recreationally like 15 years ago I have never done it I I don't want to say I would never do it but it's never been something that's called to me but you know I hear these stories and I want to hear your story Kelly because the people who advocate for it are people I like they're people I respect and they're people who they advocate for it in such a strong way that it does make me curious like wow what what one of the things I I've learned in life is that some of the most valuable things are the things you don't know how to Value meaning you've never traveled so you don't get the big deal about travel you've never done this you don't understand what you're missing out on and those are some of the most valuable things and when somebody is is stuck in one of those mindsets you just want to shake them and be like dude you don't know trust me like whatever I don't know if this is one of those things but I've heard about it enough where it's made me curious yeah yeah so first Sam I think you made the right decision set in setting is very important um I think that um encouragement of therapeutic pyin use uh for anyone that feels called Sean I think you make a great for for anyone that feels called is the most important single thing we can do in America uh period I I I I actually believe that I think we are truly um losing our minds a bit in the country through the all this change that's happening the the highest leverage area we can do work on is our brains um and this isn't everything but it is a blunt force extremely powerful tool um to help rewire our brand tell let me let me let me give my experience so my mom dies I'm I'm kind of at an existential moment on kind of thinking about you know what I want to do our company was cranking before covid you had 100 employees was was struggling because the the whole Market was cut off and I again conservative guy never super stigmatized view never thought about these things um yeah can you imagine you no like 12-year-old you weing your Brooks Brothers CIS being like one day you're going to be advocating for psychedelics still got the Brooks no I could have never I still got the sports goat still got the Brooks Brothers um I try to wear that when I talk about this because I think it's a very important thing actually you cross the aisle everyone needs to wake up to but uh and I do talk to a lot of Republicans about this who are waking up but yeah so so a friend who is a scientist said let's do this therapeutic session blindfold uh high dose music um 4 hours introspective alone and I'll give a couple examples of of what I saw it's really hard to describe but I was working with my wife and you know we were running a startup stressful you know we would quibble a lot and I I saw myself uh kind of getting angry at her and then my brain like zoomed up and I saw the expanse of the whole like world like it like zoomed out of the whole galaxy and I'm like it just put this simple inside in my head like I'm so [ __ ] stupid to get mad at my amazing wife about these stupid things in the expanse of like how lucky I am it's a simple Insight we can all say that like to be grateful that it you shouldn't SW at the small stuff I've I'm not perfect by any means but I I think about that like every hour like like with her like like it's totally it's like a car crash like cemented to my head of how grateful and lucky I am with her and how stupid it is to get like angry over small things completely transformed my thought on that I saw my mom and she gave me a hug and I like had this idea that she still lived within me and that I could carry her Legacy forward by like working with my sister on the book and various um you know this mission to kind of try to um carry her her story forward I truly like have that imprinted in my head I've never been upset about my mom dying and I truly feel like viscerally that she lives inside us and lives inside this Mission lives inside the book we wrote again it's a simple the best way to describe it is the neuroplasticity you can talk about a car crash or you can get in a car crash and it's like when something really traumatic happens your brain like wires and it's like deep rooted in your brain what it does is it it helps you kind of get out of the um uh trauma and thought processes and fears that we're inevitably ingrained with and helps um cement in a really solid way uh some of these potentially new uh Frameworks um that that sound trit but are like have the seriousness of of a long-term thing and then the other thing I'd say I think a lot of people talk about this and again Sean it's only I just share my story it's only um you know as you're called but I think it is important to hear these stories I think it's really dumb and and and kind of not correct to talk about as some kind of like corporate or executive you know hack because it's much deeper than that but for me it's the most profound and important professional thing I've ever done I mean like the whole kind of growing up in DC trying to chase up the ladder go to the good schools the HBS you know Conformity it definitely is like you know definitely I think consistently gives you this kind of like you know idea of how these stupid games we playing just don't matter and um definitely solidified in my head like uh hopefully some fearlessness on like pushing um you know a mission forward and led to led to led to what I'm doing now and and you know I'd like to think that's ingrained in the company I I you know from my perspective having a mission that's sincere that Justus and I have and um it's been a differentiator in recruiting like-minded people and customers and Merchants it's not a Panacea for everything I think a lot of people get to this place through prayer through meditation through other routes it's not like a shortcut but it definitely is a way Brute Force to get out of um your your uh traps that are holding you back that's pretty damn convincing Sean I think you uh like to make an appointment yeah I think you're gonna have you're busy next weekend I think you're gonna have to mark some time off your calendar I don't know man that sounds when I hear that I think blindfolded with headphones on I find that to be incredibly intimidating I find I I I want the I want the the result I don't know if I can go through did you do it time or have you done it more since is it like a regular thing or yeah no I it seem like giving child birth that um you know it was a profound experience so I want to do right away again it's it's a really um but but I I've done it a couple more times I mean to be to be totally honest Sam it's it's all about I I will promise you this and and frankly this is my perspective but if anyone feels called if you are called and you're doing it in a in a good setting without you know somebody ranting about politics to you before and and where you feel safe and you walk towards the and this is what the critical research says quite frankly but if you walk towards your fears if you go into it a way to explore and walk towards you know your your your issues whatever that means to you it's going to be I I've never personally met someone that's done it in a responsible therapeutic way who hasn't said it's been the most impactful experience of their lives I actually don't know anyone that hasn't said that it's not like a a club or anything but it truly is if you're called to do it I I would say this to people if if this resonates I I would try to do it like urgently like like I think your life is really like many people I know and for me it's like kind of before and after um uh is this legal like can you Google like like syum retreat near me yeah so I I I I I did it in a it's legal in some countries um there's a phase three FDA approval in the United States um to make it legal which where just I are actually advocating a lot onto I think it fits into the whole root cause Health thing that we're trying to push forward there's s religious exemptions there's uh state byst state um decriminalization so I'm not going to give legal advice I would I would urge people to find a responsible legal uh way uh to do it therapeutically in a in a trusted safe setting um and um yeah and Sam it's it's just it's just about what whenever you you feel called but uh but it's four hours it's exploring your you know your uh what's holding it all back right just different narratives and stuff I mean I think you guys are amazing how openly you talk about kind of your mental models and stuff it's just a way to like zoom out and re-explore those yeah I think it's awesome I'm totally in favor of it I just it's not I'm I'm a little intimidated still well one one of my favorite phrases is uh when the student is ready the teacher appears and I think you know you're saying when you're called to something I've always felt this way with which is that um things happen at the right time and you you know intuitively you'll you'll know when the right time is for certain things or if it's for you there's a great YouTube video I watched of Tim Ferris talking about um psychedelics Tim Ferris is a big advocate for psychedelics I think he has a nonprofit that he started that's funding research but what I liked about his video was that he wasn't trying to convince you at all to do it in fact he started by essentially convincing you all the reasons you shouldn't do it um and was very measured and responsible in the way that he talked about it so if anybody's curious if this made you curious I would watch that video because I thought that was very helpful in framing it I won't try to summarize his points because I thought he did a good job but just try to Google or YouTube for uh for Tim FIS talking about it's like a five minute clip or something I completely agree with that it's not like an endorsement but it is Criminal and I think one of the biggest issues in the country that we don't make this tool available just last week uh the FDA actually threw a wrench into the approval process for MDMA um again like Justin and I see trumed as an advocacy organization we're we're lobbying and have a relationship with 100 members of Congress both sides of the aisle we're actually working with presidential candidates too and and and and and uh members of Congress to brief them about this issue the FDA does not like these treatments because instead of long-term kind of numbing your symptoms it actually does help you get into you know the cause and unpacking the trauma that we all have and the mental Ms that we all have so actually like you know this gets into what we're talking about earlier like these type of I consider this a root cause treatment right anything that gets to the root with mental health it's obviously the the mental models holding us back with metabolic conditions it's its food and lifestyle habits what's interesting is is you know when you first started talking about this I was almost chuckling a little bit to myself like oh uh you know first he was kind of railing against prescribing a drug to solve the problem and then here he's saying the drug solves the problem for me or it it was a great intervention but what actually what you're saying is that in both cases it's the cleaning of the fish tank so in the first case that the cleaning the thing that was making you sick was the food in the second case the thing that was making you sick in the head was your own story and perspective on things and this was a a way to change the narrative in your head the the perspective and the story that you were telling yourself every day so I think in both cases you're actually advocating for cleaning the tank yeah as my wife and and Justin and people that know me will tell you I have a long I'm I have a long way to go my the biggest H room in my house is the room for improvement but like for me this uh you know what I did what a bumper love that did this a couple times and I haven't done in a long time Sean because it just it it jams for me of like it's the basics it's like be a good person try to exercise eat healthy meditate you know like like like the key to life is that like that was a big thing for me it's just like the having the nirada experience of what the world is with with this is one thing but like the the implementation for me is like so that that was my message from it and I think it's like it was a good message for me it's like I think that's what most most people that do this in a therapeutic way get it's like I need to be a better person things are connected um so yeah it's not like like you take it and it's a Panacea it's like it's like a tool it is a like nuclear weapon uh like blunt force instrument to like jam some truths um and it is you know not to get too trippy but it is a natural substance um uh you know the oldest living organism that we basically derived from this fungus um so you know yeah it's a good question but um it's not to me it's not anti-a pro- Fara it's what is a root cause cure um what actually helps us you know get to the get to the problem and and I think most modalities that help us actually cure things are uh are uh pushed back against and uh and drugs that are uh basically help numb and are recurring are incentivized do you ever take it like just to have fun like recreationally or only medically I mean I've taken it recreationally I thought it was awesome but I didn't high high level I'd say like it's it's impossible to even like articulate in like I don't have the English words to articulate how different like a like taking something at a concert is versus a therapeutic experience it's like it's like a different Stratosphere like I truly think if people are called for and do it a therapeutic high-doses way it's going to be one of the most impactful uh experiences of their lives um so it's just say it's very very very different the set and setting and dose uh but high level I think when you just compare the science on things like Alcohol and Other Drugs that we take versus um versus what these drugs do which are actually brain regenerative in many ways and very low side effects I think even how we think about recreational drug use is you know our government you know we prescribe 15% of high schoolers basically meth you know Aderall which is which is literally like one molecule away from meth we you know F's pretty powerful alcohol is very harmful um you know I think we totally have it backwards on what's appropriate for recreational years and I think it's I think it's just fine personally just from a medical perspective from a scientific leadership perspective even from like a spiritual perspective it's like you know people taking lowd dos as psychedelics and talking about their feelings talking about their lives getting deep I mean it's kind of like where did this like where like I was watching this thing from the 80s where they were talking about MDMA and it's like too many people are going dancing and feeling together and loving to each other it's like it's like it's like you watch like the the fear M it's like is that a bad thing like and then there's like very little side effects so um on the end that you made frog do commercials this is like they're like this is your brain on drugs and it's just a flower it's nice it's there's no problem with it you know I wanted to say thank you for coming on I appreciate your kind of your openness and I don't know your contrarian opinions cuz I'll be honest with you a lot of times when you were talking I was thinking is this a conspiracy theory or is this a fact at the same time I was thinking he sounds crazy but my eyes verify what he's saying meaning I look at the food we're we eat and we're sold I look at the people around me I look at the the health conditions and you're not wrong about that and so I thought this is one of the more interesting episodes it's one of the few episodes I would say is an important episode like we do a lot of fun episodes interesting episodes but this is one of the few that I could say is important and um yeah I just appreciate you coming on man this is this was a good time I appreciate you guys so much and um my big pitch anyone listening that resonates there's a lot of Economic Opportunity if you agree with this thesis because it has to change and we need more entrepreneurers need more people thinking about changing healthare STS because it has to move in that direction um but I appreciate you guys so much listen to the podcast every episode and uh uh just awesome to talk shop with you guys you're the man we appreciate you thank you all right that's the pod [Music]

extreme force of will extreme bias for action and a questioning of the the default speeds it changes [Music] everything yeah you know I'm on this uh business entertainment tick where I'm looking for Content that is about business but is made to be entertaining um so it's not just like a an informational video or or blog post and so there's a new show called figh in that I watched uh that I thought was really good did you see it I saw the commercials for it how do you get it it's on Roku but I don't have Roku you just Google like Watch Fight Inc and it's Roku just lets you just it's on their website but you don't have to sign up you don't to do anything you just click and you just watch it so uh it's very cool I mean they basically follow around Dana you know behind the scenes and the UFC like kind of the machine behind the show and the UFC just to put this in perspective they basically there is no offse season the UFC is 52 weeks a year every Saturday has to be an epic show it's a live event with pay-per-view it's got fighters who get injured and pull out or get arrested and now they can't fight and there's all kinds of things that can and will go wrong but it's like the actual epitome of The Show Must Go On so I wanted to share with you a couple of my thoughts watching this from a Founders point of view so the first thing is as silly as this sounds I do think that Dana White is on my Mount Rushmore of startup Founders and I know he didn't technically found the UFC but he basically did he created the goddamn thing he's a mad man he is a Workhorse he is a machine and I really don't think the UFC happens if there's no Dana White and this got me thinking there are some companies that I will call inevitable an inevitable company is one whose time has just come so you know YouTube today is a giant company but YouTube's time had come like if it wasn't YouTube if Chad Steve had not created YouTube somebody else would have created the equivalent of YouTube like the idea of putting hosting video online was going to happen it was happening somebody was going to win that space that's an inevitable idea the momentum of internet speeds going up and being fast enough where you can now upload and download videos was was was going to a point where video be and it was an obvious thing we had flicker for photos we were going to have the a version of that for videos I would say that Google was an inevitable idea the more popular the internet got people already needed search engines and portals Google happened to be the winner of all the search engine and portals but there was going to be a way to search the internet that was going to happen so there's inevitable companies and then there's companies that I honestly don't think if it was not for the force of will of the founder for the vision the skill and the determination of the founder that would would not have happened or would not have happened for like 50 more years it would have missed a whole generation of people had that person not made that thing happen my examples that I would put here are elon's companies so I think Tesla and SpaceX would not have happened um and would not have happened at least for another 50 years had he not made those happen I think it required an a level of insanity self-funding um technical Brilliance uh determination to keep going even against the odds of failure all of that for him to be able to pull those off um I think the UFC is in that that non inevitable bucket where if the UFC had just died it was about to go bankrupt before he before Dana bought it for $2 million I don't think that something like the UFC necessarily would have happened yeah I mean I totally agree because it wasn't like a wanted thing we did it was one of those products where we didn't know we wanted and at first it was a freak Show like I don't know if you remember one of the more famous guys who first started fighting was this black guy who would use one boxing glove and one free hand and he fought against like a 300 lb like created character in a video game all of the people look like creative characters yeah there's one Hawaiian guy who is like a sumo wrestler looking guy and he fought the dude with the one boxing arm uh it's it's weird and it was a freak Show at first but then it took like 10 years and then athletes started doing it and it became condemned like John McCain famously I think in Congress or senate or whatever asked for every state to Outlaw the UFC he called it human [ __ ] fighting and he was like this is terrible we need to end this and John McCain the American hero the the war the war hero was now saying this is this is disgusting basically and so Dana had to find venues that would support him which is why by the way Dana and Trump are so close now is because Trump would allow Dana to host fights at his uh Trump properties in um Atlantic City and so that's why you know Dana had to fight and scrap state by state city by City Event by event almost going out of business many times they went $40 million in the hole before turning this thing around turning it into A1 billion doll company D got this uh great story it was like during the [ __ ] fighting like when people started saying that stuff and he was like well what do you think these athletes think and people were like they're you know maybe they're miserable they got to go through all this pain and he goes let me tell you what they think they're killers and they want to go out and like do something that is active they need to get this energy out and they live their life like they're on he like they're in heaven and they look at your life you just go to work at 9ine you come home at 5 you sit in a cubicle as hell these guys are free this is what they were born to do and what they feel like they need to do so if you take this away from them you're hurting them way more than when they get in the ring and I thought that was actually a pretty good uh spin on it so one of the cool things about this show is it it showed a couple things I'll I'll give you the big takeaway and then some of the small takeaways so here's the big takeaway I said the word force of will and I used that word that phrase very specifically because I think it describes a certain trait of a founder and I try to have this I think the best Founders all have this and by the way this comes with some trade-offs when you have force of will it is as brute forcey as it sounds it is uncomfortable to be around sometimes you are pushing people maybe you're holding a higher standard maybe you're demanding that things are done a certain way or done at a certain speed that does not feel good to the other people that are in the organization that maybe used to working in other environments where they don't have that and so there's a little story so basically it's like the one of the big fights of the year is coming up in 18 days and they've done everything they've prepped all the marketing they've got the billboard they show them paint the Billboards at night they show them making all the marketing videos they show them doing all the different things they go into promoting a live show they're selling tickets all of this which fight this was a I don't remember which one there was either the one where Jon Jones had to pull out or there was the one where um Charles olera pulled out okay and so 18 days before he gets a call fighter got hurt in his last round of his last sparring session he was sparring without headgear I think it's Ola this is Ola this is recent yeah he gets a cut on his on his eye and he can't fight so now the main event that they've sold all the tickets for that they've done all the promotion for that's been building up for six months the main event falls through and he's like and it's basically him and his guy Hunter Campbell and they're sitting in this room and this is this is business as usual disasters are business as usual for him he talks about this he goes give me all the stress I eat that [ __ ] up he goes I can take I can take it all I you could just see he's built up this resilience this tolerance like imagine the UFC which is a Live Events fighting business it's stadiums full of people when Co happened that kills the business there was no other business and Dana Not only was a sport that survived covid where it got shut down and you couldn't do live events for over a year you can't just turn off a business for a year and hope it's all going to be okay instead he was the first sport back he created something called fight Island he created a bubble where he's like cool we'll test everybody then they get here and everybody he is testing nobody comes in or out and he found an island in the Middle East that they could do this on and he branded it as fight Island they were the first sport back it was incredible so he was used to this so he's talking and he's like what if we did this fight what if we did this fight and the guys in the room are like yeah we could call them um you know I put out a call he's going to call me back whatever and somebody walks by they go his manager's in the lunchroom right now here and Dana within 0.1 seconds just hops out of his chair nobody else does Dana hops out of his chair leaves the you see him and the camera's following they go he goes to the cafeteria he's not even at the table yet and he starts saying he's like Usman versus whoever Usman versus versus I forgot who he's gonna fight at the time but um Usman versus G versus gatei let's just pretend it was gatei and the manager is like eating a salad he's like what and he's like who's one first gatei we got to do it and he's like no man I don't want to do this he's like he's like what are you kidding me this is a huge opportunity for him if he fights this guy or it's kza he's like who's one versus Hamza you got to do it and the guy's like um he's like no no he's not ready blah blah blah not ready who do you want to fight he says this other guy he goes what does that do for you and he immediately he basically in like four seconds cuts the deal with him and and khabib was there and khabib was like no I think Dana's right I think this is what he should do it's gonna be huge for his career and so they cut the deal and um and the agent who's an he's like a super agent he's like the you know like uh he's an agent for all these Fighters you would think an agents like R Emanuel he says in the thing he goes this is why I don't talk to Danea anymore he's too intimidating for me uh like he's too too like forceful for me about what what he wants to do and so I saw that and I noticed and I said most people will watch that scene and they'll they won't even pay attention to what just happened which is that the greatest Founders in the world the greatest seos in the world they cut through the [ __ ] all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copyrighting we've talked about cop writing and how it's changed our Liv constantly on this podcast and we give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast while we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show there's a another video I saw recently of uh what's who's the guy Walter Isaacson who did the bio of Elon Musk with Elon he's on someone's podcast I think I think he's on Steve's podcast and he's telling the story and he says Elon is talking to the Twitter team and he's like hey cut cost we need to shut down the Sacramento um server farm and his Engineers like okay um going to be tricky because those servers are used for all of our infrastructure but we could do we'll make a plan and we'll be able to do that in six months six months what are you talking about we need to do this faster it's going to take six months Elon we that infrastructure is critical it's so interwoven into to everything that we do we're going to experience big big issues we we we'll make a plan and we'll we'll get it done I promise you we'll get it done in six months I need this done in six weeks six weeks we can't do this in six weeks we would have to do a b c it could be done in six days let's do it in six days now these guys are reeling and they're like Elon it six it can't be done six weeks six days it can't be done that way so he he leaves the meeting and I think he was going to uh like Texas for uh for Christmas yeah it's Christmas Eve it's Christmas Eve he's flying to Texas to go see his family and his his two cousins are I think on the plane with him and they're brainstorming they're like God 6 months 6 weeks this is ridiculous and then um someone on the plane has the idea they're like why don't we just go to Sacramento right now we'll just rip the servers out ourselves because one of the cousins one of the cousins I think worked at Solar City or whatever and he was like you know we could we could use some servers we definitely need some servers and he's like all right sounds good and I think the idea was like if we just take the server is offline they're going to have to figure out how to fix it and they'll fix it in Faster than 6 weeks I promise you that I I think that was underlying it so Elon on the plane on Christmas Day basically Christmas Eve they're flying toh to Texas Midway through the flight just tells the pilot turn around we're going to go land at Sacramento Pilot's like okay and then he says hey do you have a pocket knife and the Pilot's like yeah I do his bodyguard his bodyguard was like here I got one and like whips out this pocket knife and so they go to Sacramento they take the knife they basically and the the company that the farm basically they were like Hey we're closed dude it's Christmas Eve and he's like let me in these are my servers uh open this door right now I don't need you to do anything just open this door I'm going in opens the door gets in takes down the servers I don't I don't know the exact ending of the story but same thing extreme force of will extreme bias for action and a questioning of the the default speeds for everybody in the company and when you know that your default speed or your default clarity thinking is going to be questioned it changes everything and so I've been on the other side of this when I was at twitch EMT was somebody who I've always said his oven Burns a little hotter he's smarter than than the average bear and I felt that if you were in a room with EMT and you presented a plan that to nine out of 10 people in the company it would sound okay they wouldn't challenge your assumptions EMT would always challenge the assumptions of why we're doing it how much it's going to cost why it has to take that long Etc and if your logic was not bulletproof if you were not already maxed out in your thinking of what was possible you were going to eat [ __ ] in that meeting you are going to get shredded in front of like 18 people and not in a mean way but your logic is going to get shredded you are going to get verbally undressed and that changes things when you once that once you know that that's what's on the line you come in a little differently you sit a little straighter you walk a little faster you you know dot your dot your eyes and cross your tees when you go into those meetings and so he only had to do it once and then for the next 18 months I was ready every meeting with EMT and so I think that this is just a very valuable trait that they don't teach em nice about it was he is EMT a courteous person EMT sort of has that like autistic forgiveness where you're like he's not being mean about it he's not being nice about it he's being very direct but you're like he's always that's just how he is he's just being direct he's just like he's not trying to be he's not trying to be mean and I wouldn't even say mean is the right word he's just trying to get to the truth and he needs you to get out of the way so that the truth can appear he doesn't care about your feelings in the search for the truth and in fact the more you kind of try to get in the way of the truth the more he's like what are you doing get out of the way we're trying to find the truth here that's the way I would describe how it felt from my point of view and and really like I was rarely on the receiving end of it but I saw it happen many a time and I took note very quickly of like okay you got to come correct here well because I don't like people who are like and I used to behave this way and I and I regret how I used to behave but of like being needlessly rude and I think that the people who are needlessly rude I think Dana would fall in that category because he loves to fight he loves to battle so he just told the story last week he goes let me tell you something I'm going to war right now with Caesar's Palace and they're like why he goes for the last six months I've been playing like back backarat or some like uh casino game with them he goes I'm up $17 million on them right now he goes I wake up in the morning and I think how am I going to win this war today and he goes I'm going to lose eventually because they're going to win but right now I'm crushing them and each morning I wake up I go to work and instead of going home or he he said he goes like I when my when my kids are asleep I go back to the casino and I'm ready to go to war and I thrive off that he goes I want my back against the wall and I want to go to war so I gotta say this because I'm a anybody who's an actual gambling degenerate you listen to Dana's gambling story and this is only going to apply to 1% the audience so I apologize for the 99% who are like who cares about this I care a lot about this so his story has some holes on his gambling stuff here's I would like to list some of the holes that I'd like to expanation i' like to come on and talk about he tells some of the holes like he tells us one time that he got too drunk and he lost he goes I I think I lost $60,000 and I wake up in the morning and they're like hey man you you owe us he goes yeah I'll get you the 60 he goes no no no no no it's six million yeah I'm not saying he he doesn't admit that he loses I just in that interview he said I'm up 17 million on Caesars this year year to date he says my rule is that if I make a million bucks I walk and If I Lose I'm willing to lose up to six million okay oh my God then he says um I've only lost twice this year so it doesn't add up how do you if you win if you walk away when you win a million or you lose six million and you're up 17 million and you've only lost two days of the year and it's we're halfway through the year the math ain't math in on that one fourth thing he represents himself as a like skilled Gambler who beats the house he's playing bakarat which is like a 50-50 push game and blackjack where you're down 4951 there is no skilled like the biggest loser in the world is a professional blackjack player I'm just gonna say that again the biggest loser in the world is a professional blackjack player because your professional at something that is stacked against you is a by definition losing game secondly you're probably smart and could have done so many things with your life and you chose to play a game that is stacked against you as your professional career and third you're delusional because there's no such thing as a professional blackjack player that is why that is The Biggest Loser job in the world well he's but the fact that he like continues to do it I'm not saying Dana is that by the way Dana's job is running the UFC but just as a side tangent to any professional black deck player out there that makes no sense he could be a degenerate and also and also a great business he could be a degenerate Gambler and also a Jord was and many others are so what else did you learn in that documentary or that show so force of will bias to action speed cutting through the BS um I think is is tremendous and his other employees even said this like the head of PR was like she goes yeah work starts at uh work starts at 8:30 it's 6:30 right now I'm do my workout but Dana just texted me saying are you at the office yet I told him not yet but I'll be there soon and she was like you know Dana's gonna do this press conference Dana is the type where he once he decides he's going to do something he's like a a rhino going to do it he's he's going to bulldoze through and you're either with him on it and you're helping him do that or you should just get out of the way and you know I I just thought man another really hard job being the head of PR for the UFC is a very very difficult job and that woman is with him everywhere uh I forget her name but uh Landa or Linda or something she's always with him and what you'll what you'll notice is they do the press conferences after the fight in New York time it's like at 2: a.m. and then you'll see him Monday in France for another press conference they work their asses off yeah 100% let me tell you all right so we talked about a company on here A bunch of times but I actually just met the the founder so I'm going to do a little bit of a repeat but remember how we talked about 29029 the ever sing thing it's the outdoor race where you kind of R run up and down a hill as many times as it takes to run the equivalent of Mount Everest an awesome thing started by PR of the podt Jesse itler and and others yeah so it's uh I guess Everest is 29,000 feet so hence 29 ,29 is the name of their uh brand we've talked about them a bunch but the guy coincidentally joined Hampton recently so I was able to like I called them this morning and I was just talking through them because I've been so fascinated we talked about uh H rocks and we talked about a b a bunch of these underground um uh not underground but these like Niche sporting events and I actually think they're better businesses than I previously thought so let me tell you about this one so so if you go to uh 29029 I think it's called 29029 ting.com you can go to the website but check this out so they do seven events a year each event only has 300 people this year they sold out the entire year in four minutes for all of the events and he's purposely keeping this small so if you do that math that's $13 million in ticket sales that he's done and he told me that basically they want to own all the accommodation and so basically it's TurnKey you pay $6,500 you show up in some locations you can stay at like a Fairmont hotel which is where they they partner with or they do like glamping and you go to like Whistler and all these like really beautiful places and so you show up you do this event and the the reason they keep it at 300 people is so you can meet everyone and so you could have this experience where you get to know all your people and so you keep coming back year after year but listen to this they started in 2017 when they started in 2017 Jesse ller was Mark's partner on this which is like the whole idea of like an influencer partnering with you Jesse only had 5,000 5,000 followers on Instagram when they started he wasn't that big of a deal and yet in their first year of business they made $500,000 in Revenue in 2018 their second year of business they did a million dollar in Revenue by 2020 he said they were doing really great but Co happened the business got wiped out and so in 2122 they had to start all over again but he says it's a great business he's like it's negative working capital people pay upfront and I can use that money to go and pay for all the accommodations and pay for everything and he says it's a great business I was like well what's wrong about this business well he said the first thing that's sucks is it's a fad meaning tough mutter um a bunch of other events like you look at some of these events like Spartan Race they get really popular really fast and the tough mutter was doing 100 million in Revenue now it filed for bankruptcy a couple years ago like you you have to figure out how to keep people coming back over and over and over again and I asked them I said how do you how do you do that like what are like the what are like the keys to make this work because this is kind of an interesting thing I I don't know if I would ever want to start one of these but maybe one day he said the first thing you need a story so you have to tell your friends what's something exciting that you're going to be doing and it can't be really like running a marathon because everyone kind of does that but it has to be a little bit more exciting you need a story you need to be going somewhere beautiful you need to be doing some ridiculous race the second thing it's got to be challenging do you know how many people who start a Marathon finish uh 70% 99% 99% of people who start a marathon end up finishing that particular race not so hard then it's not so hard in his opinion you need roughly a 70 or 75% chance he said for his events roughly 70% of people go through with it 30% fail the third thing you have to learn some type of skill like a new skill or acquire some type of new fitness in order to accomplish it and the last thing it needs to be in a beautiful place or it looks cool in photos so I was thinking about this let me give you three ideas for ridiculous Fitness events that could work out you ready all right hit me all right the first one we're g to call it the Burly Beer Mile you dress up like Paul bunan you go in the mountains on a track near a track you run one lap chug a beer run another lap chug a beer you do that four times four beers one mile what do you think about the beerly the Burly Beer Mile look if you can give people any excuse to drink you already have 80% of a good business okay uh there's a reason that like Top Golf is really popular there's a reason that people go to baseball games still it's not because they're wondering what's going to happen in the top of the sixth it's because they want to eat hot dogs and drink beer outside like giving people an excuse to drink is a great business model if you just layer on top of that a contrast a ju to position oh it's Fitness and beer love it I'm already in I don't know about the Paul bunan I think that's uh not sure that's on Trend with the Aesthetics that we're going for here but I think if we Workshop this idea a little bit you you could have something all right how about the paddle Prison Break a paddle booat race from Alcatraz to the coast of San Francisco the prison break oh I like this one my mind was still on the beer one for a second by the way I feel like just the the beer mile or the beer the beer marathon it's a half marathon and you drink 13 beers I think has uh has legs U or maybe it's like maybe it's a it's a quarter marathon it's six beers and six miles or something like that dude I did a by the way I did a Beer Mile in college so you uh chug a beer to start a lap whatever you for four beers four laps one mile I threw up and if you throw up you have to run a fifth lap it took me 15 minutes to do it it was horrible yeah but we call that the Victory lap it's like oh I had to do a Victory lap why because I threw up during it oh man you sound fun all right so let's do um prism break so prism break is we drop you off the side of Alcatraz in a in a small boat in a paddle boat we're going to call it we're going to call it the paddle Prison Break is there like a lane setup or we just going to lose people into the ocean here what's going on we got some liability concerns we're not going to let details get in the way of a good idea here I think I think there is definitely something to the prison break out of alcatra if you can do that there's a a swim race that happens every year but I'll give you my last uh horrible Fitness idea you ready we're gonna call it for the prison break you have to start in cuffs great for the photo adds a story adds a challenge you're gonna have to learn and have to help each other get out of the Cuffs so everybody's in cuffs you need somebody in this race who like can just get out of cuffs and then they'll get the little pick and they'll start picking other people out and then that's how you get out of this and you have to have a criminal record in order to get invited you must have to have at least a a little gold patch on your on the shoulder if you actually have a felony or mis beer yeah we'll just call you out there and the last horrible idea we're gonna call it the skyline scramble a race through NYC but you can't touch the ground you got to go from building to building a like a park core challenge yeah baby the only person who survives wins no these are all horrible ideas but I did think it was incredibly interesting to hear this guy's business I didn't actually think that this company could be as good as it is but I'll be eager to see if this thing works I uh I dude I think these type of experiential businesses I remember when I ran a conference it wasn't the same thing but like having a thing that you work towards and then all the people come to it was like it was a very fulfilling thing to do versus just being on the internet all the time it felt nice to meet your customers and things like that it was pretty awesome so you didn't give me the heads up about this but I'm down to to Workshop a few ideas live for you here if you'd like all right what what do you got when you were thinking of these what what how did you put yourself in the mindset to even come up with these ideas what were you what got you going well they're not very good ideas so uh so whatever mindset I was in I would say avoid that all right we're gonna go with um maybe nost stalgia so uh the Boston Rover it's it's Red Rover remember that game Red Rover it's but with just all the people in the city of Boston as many people as can show get on one team and we're playing Red Rover just a Citywide hide-and go seek a Citywide hide-and go seek exactly it's not really Fitness at this point children's games I've gone into it's they're all horrible ideas but I just thought that this segment is fascinating dude I think that U one day I could see myself doing this yeah to make one of these yeah yeah yeah they seem awesome they it's like the um you know how we talked about um like viral food it's like how do you make how do you make your restaurant go viral well you need like some type of food that's either oversized or extra small or is a different color or it's typically the a side for example uh cookie dough make it the main yeah it's like cookie dough you make that the main thing or you mash up two things that don't go together or you mash up two things that yeah and I'm like what could you do for fitness and I thought was interesting um same idea by the way speaking of beautiful settings and doing races in memorable places where should people be racing to right now I think they should race to wanderer.com MFM why should they do that well it's actually a pretty good deal here so if you go to wander right now wander is a place where you can go rent beautiful um

was looking at some of these um properties the problem I have with wander I got a bone to pick with wander which is the pictures are so good that I started booking vacations to places I don't even want to go I just like normally you're like I pick a city and then let me find a place to stay here I went and I was like dude this house is sick I guess I'm going to Naples like where where am I going I don't know like I'm going to Florida now wasn't even trying to go to Florida and so they're setting they're setting expectations so high so for example have you ever seen um have you ever seen like people who take pictures of the pyramids and then they zoom out and there's like hot dog vendors and there's like you know what I mean Instagram versus reality type of thing like these photos are so freaking good if they zoom out is there goingon to be like a trailer right next to the home like how are these so awesome no dude I've had people who use these for like corporate offsites cuz like some of these places are pretty baller so they they use it to like do a there's like one in son I know my friends did for a corporate offsite and they were like no it was sick it was amazing um they might there has to be I mean these photos look so good that there it has to be some version of like shoot for the stars and you still land on the moon type of thing but uh yeah if it's anywhere near as good as it looks I'm uh I'm very excited you have on this document the difference between running a business for growth versus iida versus cash flow I'm interested you got my attention yeah this is a CEO School uh tactical session when you were running the hustle did you obviously all of these things are good you want growth you want e you want cash flow the problem is when you want three things equally you usually get none um so they're G generally in any business at any point in time tends to be some some order of priority um when you were at the hustle did you which of these did you focus on and was there ever a shift in oh now we're focusing on this instead of this I didn't run the business long enough you know we sold like four and a half years in to make the shift but it was for the longest time it was Revenue was the number one priority followed by cash flow followed by profit and so what I wanted to do was double Revenue every year so I think we went from like 500,000 in Revenue to 2.2 to like five to 12 or something like that and we didn't make a lot of profit along the way I think the year we sold we did maybe a million in profit but our c cash flow was high so I was able to add like $2 million to our bank account and explain to somebody who's like wait how do you have a million dollar of profit 2 million of cash flow how does that work in a business like the hustle so I'll give you guys an a really easy example so we had this thing called Trends it was $300 a year but for the sake of this conversation let's just say it was $1,200 a year and if a customer paid upfront let's say they paid me on June 1st $1,200 for an annual subscription my cash flow was $1,200 that's so much my business accepted into our bank account but the way that Gap accounting generally accepted uh principles of accounting the way that works is that $1,200 was really only $100 in June $100 in July and $100 each month and so my Revenue was only $100 per month that they stayed with me even though I collected $1,200 thus my profit let's just say that it cost me uh $75 to produce the content my profit was $100 minus $75 uh so 25 bucks exactly and so I'm in a situation right now I have a business that uh my Ecom business where we've been running it for maybe four years now and it's doing really well it's been I was only growth focused so I was like you I wanted to double or more every year and so we did we which the re the reason being is typically not always typically it's harder to grow Revenue but it's easier to Once revenue is grown to become profitable exactly I think it's the right order of operations actually there there's one one pre-step even before growth which is just product Market fit meaning have I made something that people want do I feel like uh if I produce this that there's a market pull for this so once we was like verifi product Market fit great now it was grow I think in year one we did six or seven million I think in year two we basically got to 12 something year three was bigger than that now year four is bigger than that so we basically been you know uh growing by somewhere between 50 and 100% every year for the four years but I have pulled out exactly Z from this business I have put in my pocket Z from this business in four years wait really yeah I've taken nothing out of the business I've reinvested everything but it's not a oh I could have took a ton of money out of this business it's like well like for example one year we basically had no profit we did you know eight figures of Revenue and we were Break Even essentially and I was like what are we doing here how did this happen so like the bank did but did the bank account ever go up like was your was your cash position ever good well econ you have one other variable which is inventory and so the the cash has been pretty steady but the inventory assets are going up but they're also inventory that might take a while to move it might be slow it might be whatever and so you don't I don't want my cash tied up in inventory that is not actually the plan that's a it's a byproduct unless you can pay your employees and bills in inventory it sucks yeah exactly so I've been going through this process where I shifted from where I first was in growth and then I shifted to iida and so um that requ Ed a certain set of skills so I'll share with you some of the Lessons Learned shifting to iida first so we and we've successfully shifted to eida and so we iida being uh earnings before interest tax uh amation uh amortization and depreciation exactly um okay so what what did I do to make that shift the first thing was uh and the reason I'm saying this is because there's probably people out there who are running a business that's been high growth low low cash flow or high growth low profit and um for some businesses that's the right move you want to stay in that for a very long time maybe it's a win or take all Market maybe it's a land grab situation maybe you're Venture backed and it's a billion dollar a bust this is not that this is a business I own that I you know if we sell this business it might be you know $100 million do or less is is like where this will thing will land but that's great we we own the business we have no outside um you know investors and so it's it's no big deal so anyways the point of this uh point of this rant is basically how do you make that shift so I first went and talked to people who so step one figure out what the right ebit target is so I go talk to people who are in the same space to figure out what ebit margin is kind of the low end of what's possible to the high end of what's possible and then I ended up shooting for somewhere like you know the 60% Mark like 10 to 25% yeah so for me that's like 17% uh margin so the best ones were like yeah we have 25% like the Ecom ones but then you dig under the hood it's like oh you don't do any marketing like somehow well I do so that's just not going to happen um but getting to 17 18% is like wow that would be really great and then the low end is like 10% so that's the first thing then envelope uh create like a EB what I call it ebit budget so basically you take for every $100 of Revenue that comes in what percentage is going to go to each of the following categories my overheads my cost of goods sold my Opex my advertising and marketing Etc and so you create an ebit budget and you basically say what where does the dollars flow today so you do a last 12 months look back say where on average every month we're spending 5% of Revenue on overhead and you know 12% on uh in the Ecom case maybe it's shipping fulfillment whatever so you create a current status budget and then you say well in order to get my margin I need to find you know eight points of extra profit margin somewhere so where's it going to come from and so you start to basically pull calories from from these different departments all right marketing you're going to have to give me two points here and shipping you're going to have to find a way to cut off one point and you basically find the extra eight points of margin that you're going to need that stuff is it's it's not hard to do it in a spreadsheet it's really hard to track it on a weekly and monthly basis to make sure that it's really hard so once I did that now it's time to communicate so step three communicate the plan relentlessly so I then go to the leaders of the company I say hey guys forget everything I said before now this is what matters right uh we still want to grow sure secondary priority first priority is we're going to grow iida what's eida where where are we tracking this today so so I'll show them hey here's what it is here's what it needs to be here's how we get there and here's the Cadence of how we're going to track this and now I put the the onus on them I said you need to find me one or two points of margin in your department or you need to find me three points over here how are you going to do it so come to me tomorrow or in two days with a plan of how you're going to get that extra margin and also I want you to create a report that tracks this you know the sort of uh you know if you're a cost center or you're a profit center of the business you need to create a little Dash and you need to show me how you're going to basically update that every single week or every single month so we do that and every single month I start hammering people on this and then the fourth step is tie their incentives to so I go to my CMO and I say great last year your bonus was based on Revenue this year your bonus is based on eida you want your and by the way I'll actually increase your bonus you can it we'll remove the cap you can actually get a bigger bonus if you're able to get even bigger eida so now it's on you to figure out how that happens but if we don't hit our eida targets you get no bonus okay so now incentives are aligned to achieve that thing and so those are the kind of the first four steps last step which is basically actually go do the thing over and over and over again somebody gave me some great advice along the way they go oh you're in eida mode yes called spring cleaning so here's what you're going to do you're going to go and you're going to say there's got to be some lwh hanging fruit you're going to go and you're going to find a bunch of SAS subscriptions that you should cut off you're going to find this this agency you're paying too much and realize ah we don't need that agency whatever it is and you're going to feel like cool we cut the cost schedule a calendar reminder in 30 days you're going to do the exact same thing again yeah and you're going to feel like well we we already cleaned it out but it's just like cleaning a house you first clean out the surface level mess once that's gone now you start to realize oh wait we never actually dusted this area or this closet is actually stuffed now let's start to unpack this closet and so we've done I would say three or four of these spring cleanings now this year and it's only six months into the year so I've done it at least three times maybe four and each time we go and we unearth more stuff and you can't do it every day that's not the right way to focus on it but like you know on a monthly or every two months basis to go back through and say all right let's uh let's trim some more fat where's more fat and inevitably you will find more things not ax why are you why are you going after iida because so I I'll mention this a little bit but if people rag on me I'm not like incredibly well versed but I've been looking into like EA might be [ __ ] like so there's this thing called Gap generally accepted uh principles whatever it's like what we all like abide by there's a lot of [ __ ] in there why eida versus cash flow cash flow also works cash flow required me to do a second big project so the second big project was okay where's that cash going why doesn't the cash go in my pocket oh the cash goes into inventory and so separately we did us like after I did the eida cleanup first first couple months I said okay great now the EB is great every month but my bank balance is not going up proportionate to the iida and so first three months of the year we killed it on eida awesome where's the money going going oh it's going into inventory how do we get our inventory levels to be right size so that this cash flow flows to the owners of the business and not to the warehouse because today it's going to the warehouse and um which is a separate Challenge and a separate discipline altogether and it's a three-legged stool you need all three legs to have amazing business you need a growth leg because if you're not growing the business is not worth very much um you need you need profit if you don't have profit business not worth very much and then you need that profit to result in free cash and if you can get all three you have a beautiful amazing business but in order I kind of wanted to go in in those three because again there's not going to really be much cash flow if you're operating at a net loss so I needed to First be making sure there's a surplus of profit then I needed to make sure that surplus of profit is resulting in free cash flow and you just so happened to be in an industry where those iida and cash flow things they're really hard it's really hard like to figure out the inventory and stuff like that that is a science I uh I n this my major takeaway is Ecom is a terrible business to be in um and when is it not a terrible business if you are if you are winning the game and you still think it's a bad bad category to be in that's when you know it's a bad category most people they lose the game they're failing at it and then they blame the category right uh so for example and and the opposite is true too I was telling somebody about podcast oh man podcast is great blah blah blah he goes well yeah you won the lottery so of course you love lottery tickets like you know your podcast is popular it works like of course podcasting is great for you but for the million podcasts that are not really getting listened to is it would you would it feel the same way right is it winning dependent and so this one's interesting because our e-com store is winning and even in winning I'm like note to self this is not the category to be in next time um beyond that I would say playing the game on hard mode has a bunch of disadvantages and I wouldn't put myself in this position voluntarily however once you're in a position where you're playing some game on hard mode there is one big benefit which is if you ever get to play an easier game you will dominate it's like a it's like I was playing pickle ball with a guy and it was his first time playing pickle ball he's amazing I'm like yo why you didn't he's like well I'm played college tennis it's like I played a harder game and I won that game so like yeah I'm pretty good at pickleball it's not so it's not that hard for me in the same way I was listening to uh Andrew and Chris from Tiny they were doing like a Q&A and they the guy was like yeah I'm in e-commerce D Toc which you guys say you don't love that space would would you recommend I just quit or what should I go do and he goes well one of the things that worked for us was because we ran agencies which are can be low margin grindy businesses with a bunch of HR problems and hard to scale because we did you know e-commerce once we went into into easier businesses We just cleaned up we could buy a software business that was running at 10% margins and get it to 40% just cuz that guy wasn't really he wasn't willing ruthless with pricing he was not negotiating with vendors he was not you know taking care of you know all these little things that we had we had to do to survive in these other categories that in a softer category you're you're not as on the hook for who do you think is winning in e-commerce and what attributes do they have Shopify Facebook no I mean of course of course of course retailers uh DDC whatever you want to call it I think right now the retailers that are taking advantage of Tik Tok the Tik Tok flywheel are cleaning up and what I mean by that is there is a very specific moment of time right now where you can create content on Tik Tok either yourself as a brand or even better you use an army of Affiliates and ugc creators and whether it's with Tik Tok shops or people just hear about the brand so much on Tik Tok they go Google search it and they find your Amazon or they find your DDC shop that flywheel I'm invested in a couple companies that are doing this that flywheel is pretty unreal right now but only for certain categories I would imagine is it only for things where young people are using nope that's amazing that's ridiculous right let's move on I've said too much all right I want to talk about one thing that you actually had on here that I have no idea like it's it's way out of character for you your dream house or or do you want to do painted chickens well I don't have much to say about the dream house except for dude look at this sick house that's the entire topic but let's go there it's an amazing house this is a house that uh this guy on my team uh sent me and I can't believe it it's the most beautiful house I've ever seen in San Francisco it's 11,000 square feet estimated market value $23 million and it's on the ocean in San Francisco I mean there's just a few photos so this house is first to get a 11,000 foot home in San Francisco is very very hard to do every view is like the Golden Gate Bridge you're right on the water you're right on the ocean but even if you didn't want to go in the ocean well guess what you have an infinity pool in the back that just is spilling over into the Pacific Ocean on top of that there's one photo in here that I just have to show you I see a beautiful uh porch That's overlooking the San Francisco Golden Gate Bridge next photo 24 like a wine seller that is big enough that it was bigger than my childhood bedroom 25 a huge home theater that looks like they're just watching like some type of nature documentary so awesome they're setting stage here it is the reason I I want this home to begin with 26 a halfcourt basketball court with all windows where you can see the Golden Gate Bridge this is awesome is this Florida ceiling like 25 foot uh ceiling all glass window you're seeing you're looking at the ocean the breeze it's all there's a glass door that's open you see the Golden Gate Bridge and you have a beautiful basketball court inside your home with all all this light wood that I just love oh my God this is crazy dude this house is unreal I must buy this house it's not for sale so that's the first problem um but besides that I am I now have a Target I now have a desire you know I thought I had enough money now I have a desire I need to be able to drop 30 million bucks on this house dude in order to buy a $30 million home oh check this out the okay so it was owned by Sharon Stone before that or after that do you know who owned it a dentist a dentist owned this house what the hell yeah it says this guy was a dentist in order to buy a $30 million house you I'll tell you how much money I need 28 million and then I'm gonna borrow two and I'm gonna buy this house with every dollar I own and that's it no I think you need I think you need $100 million to buy a $30 million house would you say that's accurate probably at minimum yeah at minimum um the M the maintenance the taxes on on a house like this is going to be pretty insane too like your carrying costs are going to be what half a million to a million bucks a year yeah it could be no it doesn't well it could be that it would be that high probably because you're on the coast and you got to see taxes taxes Al loone in San Francisco of this on this house is going to be like quarter million to $300,000 a year that's just the property taxes so all the maintenance all the insurance all the all all the cleaning all that stuff on top of this thing is got to be at least another quarter million so at least half a million bucks yeah that's insane that's insane this is a it's a sick house the uh the last thing I wanted to ask you about you said you wrote some essay yeah your boy's getting his Paul Gram on I started writing essays why I told you I'm just in a creative season and I wanted to to do different things I like writing and I was like well what do I want to write about I realized I want to write about the stuff that I'm curious about or whenever I feel like I have a um a golden Insight so something that anything that feels insightful to me I want to be able to write it down and why do I care about that you want to spread your baby you got to spread that seed well that's part of it but I actually the bigger part is I've known uh there's this feedback loop that happens which is once you have to deliver something you start to look for it meaning when we start this podcast and let's say every week we got to do this podcast and when you show up to this podcast you got to have three interesting business things to say right you need to have three interesting business topics and in order to do that your brain starts to now go see go find interesting business topics start to ask a few more questions start to write a few more notes start to pay a little more attention and this wonderful feedback loop gets built where you start getting smarter about business more because you have this Outlet where you got to go put it and you're on the hook to go put it somewhere every so often so in the same way one of my favorite things is to learn something new right I'm a just kind of like a a learning junkie right well what by having a place to go WR it I now am hunting for more insightful things I'm reading more I'm talking to people more I'm having more you know connections between two different ideas that are disconnected and so that's the real reason because the thing I shared with you I haven't even published yet I'm going to publish all these on my website just uh sean.com but right now this one's on a Google doc I'll throw it up after after this so that it's at least online so the essay is called Paint painted chickens and uh or painted chicken and the reason it's called painted chicken is because have you ever been inside of a Subway do you eat Subway when I was a kid yeah and so I like subway I admit it um but Subway the quality has gone like way down since I was a kid and the I can't tell has the has the quality gone down or have our tastes uh gone up no the quality's gone down you know how I know this do you know all the controversy with Chipotle right now no no oh dude like uh gen Z hates Chipotle why so basically the the things started trending on Tik Tok there was like Chipotle uh jipping you on quantity okay or just like you know basically like the way that this like Chipotle used to be bomb now it sucks here's why and different people have different reasons why the taste but one of the big ones is like they're just skimping on the on the thing and then the the CEO came out and did this hilarious thing you didn't see this no it's so funny the CEO came out and he goes oh man look if you go to Chipotle and uh you want a little bit more our guys are great about this just you just give them the look and does this like stupid look like you do that our guys are and girls and girls our guys and girls are great at at at hooking you up with this and so there's all these memes now of people being like yeah when I go into a chipot and I make this face like their rea action which is like they're not like I got you bro let me hook it up and and like also impersonating him where they're like when you go into a Chipotle and you give the look are guys and girls and trans and and black people too they're all great at doing this and people are making fun of this CEO for like you know flubbing this uh this this speech that he gave so anyway Chipotle is under the microscope right now well now they all like Cava which I just went to it's awesome yeah they like Cava well one of the reason so then the founders I think came out or somebody who's like the ex CEO came out and he said two things he goes it's insane that people think uh we would tell our staff to uh like skimp on portions that's terrible for business like we've tested this the thing you do for business if you want to grow revenue and grow profits in a store is you give people bigger portions which makes them love the place and come back sales go through the roof and waste also goes down because you're giving them the food versus throwing it away if you actually want to save on food waste it's not by doing less portions it's by having more customers first so that you sell through all your food that's the way you reduce food waste it's not by skimping to customers and then they don't come back because they're angry right like that would be counterproductive the second thing that came out was the guy said basically when Chipotle had all those eoli scares they had to change their whole supply chain I don't know if you remember this like there's couple years ago where like two three times like whoops whoops again oh eoli again sorry about that so they changed all of their operating procedures so what they used to do was in the store in the back that's where they would you know chop the veggies right there they would do whatever now it all comes pre-bagged sealed from like a central headquarters where they can have really tight food safety vacuum seal it or whatever ship it to the store store just has to open it they're not doing the food prep on site well the result of that is the food tastes less fresh and the result of that is that they say they cut down the number of suppliers they were working with because it was too much risk so instead of local produ local farms for the meat they now started to go into a few vendors that are now shipping out much farther distances and maybe are more mass production less less taste so the taste actually has gone down not just the taste but because of the supply chain changes so they need to they need to I mean bring back eoli or whatever was like yeah dude let's roll the dice let's live a little right like the food's got to tastes good who cares if you get sick once a year which is insane if they sell if they serve millions of customers when it's like four people you know that is that that's like statistically insignificant I would imagine which is always the worst argument like whenever one of the social networks are like dude do you realize like they're getting hammered by Congress and all they want to say is there's two billion monthly active users how many people are in your state how many murders are there in your state per day do I blame you no I run a state a hundred times bigger than yours like they can't say that but that's the the reality is the law of large numbers if your Facebook literally anything that can happen is going to happen on your platform every single day that's just the rule of Statistics even the most like oddest strangest most screwed up behaviors are gonna happen because it's so many people it's insane yeah and so now they've had to change this whole thing but what was your essay about then so my essay is about I call it painted chicken because if you go to Subway Subway's motto was eat fresh and if you go into Subway it's just hilarious to hear eat fresh and then literally he's opening up a bag of chicken and you see the chicken and the chicken has grill marks on it and but you're like hm how come all the grill marks are so uniform what kind of Grill do they use if you go look it up that the grill marks are painted on they don't Grill the chicken that's not what those grill marks are the grill marks the gr the grill marks are literally painted on the chicken and so I I love this analogy because in every business there are there's always lip service you know every business has these stupid things that they say go go read the website of like BP and BP will be like we care about communities in the environment and they're like spilling oil into the ocean right like everybody has their their version of eat fresh which is you say eat fresh and then you just you're painting on chicken and so what I what I wanted to talk about was what are the few examples where there's not painted chicken meaning what are the examples where a company has values that they actually live by and they actually mean something because I think anybody would agree that like a a value system is very very important I remember in my first business I was um trying to make a decision we asked our Mentor we like oh we were doing a sushi restaurant thing I was like should we use the eco-friendly packaging but it's more expensive and it's kind of like the paper straw it disintegrates but it's good for the environment or should would use this one that's cheaper bad for the environment and it's super durable is actually good packaging and she was like well you're asking the wrong question you're asking the question of which packaging should we use but the question is what do we value more the environment or the convenience and affordability there is no right answer it's just a question of what you value more and you should just all your decisions need to come Upstream move your decision- making Upstream once you know your value system everything becomes obvious after that and this is just a good life a good bit of Life wisdom if you're if you're in a situation where you don't know what to do with somebody oh should I they treated me this way but I should should I respond kindly should I be mean back should I should I ignore them what should I do well if your value system is I'm a kind person that's what I do I I don't change my behavior based on other people well then the answer is obvious just be kind and move on right like that's it so what I started to look at was what are the company values that I actually remember that meant something to not only me but but the people who worked in that company and the first one that comes to mind is Facebook's move fast and break things yeah I loved it you like I think you've heard that everybody's heard that phrase by out right so I said HM move fast and break things like okay that's great is that popular because Facebook is popular like maybe it's just a popular value because Facebook was so popular all right that's Theory one well Sam what's uh what's Microsoft's core value what's Microsoft move fast and break things no idea I have no idea Twitter Lyft Uber pick any of these companies right do you know any any of them like no we don't know any from any of them in fact the only other one that I could remember like move fast and break things was Google do you know what Google is do no evil yeah don't be evil exactly don't be evil um but then it got it got silly because they maybe did a little evil well exactly so then I was thinking well here what what does there to learn from this the first thing I learned is maybe these are memorable because they're catchy right maybe that's the first thing which is that instead of just saying Integrity you should um you should say don't be evil don't be evil is more provocative it's more catchy it's more interesting than Integrity or honesty or be good right if they just said be good versus don't be evil none of us would remember that Google's values be good but a lot of us paid attention when they said our value is don't be evil so I think there's something to lesson one is if you make it provocative you make it memorable if you make it memorable people might actually use it so that's the first first little takeaway the second is well there are other catchy rhyming thing you know there's you could just try to be catchy like the the quicker picker upper that's that's cool but why does why does move fast and break things have a little bit more weight to it I think it's because it you have to pay the price right so you got to pay the cost to be the bus and what I thought was interesting was if I went to 100 CEOs of Fortune 500 companies and I said hey we think that you should you're the company should move fast that speed is an important value speed's important right moving fast would you say that's a value for your team of course H 100 out of 100 would nod their head and say yep of course definitely we value speed awesome and if you said well when you move fast like naturally some sometimes things might go wrong you might you might bump into some things you might break some things when you're moving so fast so let's let's let's agree that it's actually uh it's going to be move fast and and break things how many of out of the 100 would now agree and the reality is that 99 would be chicken [ __ ] and they would be like well well no no no we're not trying to break things around here depends it's it's Speed without breaking things and once you go to Speed without breaking things you're now Subway eat fresh painted chicken you're [ __ ] right it's now a unusable nonuseful value it might be something you put on your website but it's never going to have any weight you're never going to be one of these generational type of companies that operates differently and is known for how they operate and so I went and read this quote from Zuck and I want to read this to you so he says the values actually move fast but my theory on values is that most organizations have a lot of values that don't mean very much they're just table Stakes like if you say just be honest of course you're going to be honest you should be honest everybody agrees with that everybody knows that it means nothing it's not an option to not be honest that's a itic so he goes I think the defining principle for company meaning your company's going to have one thing that you guys really do is your a plus strength should be something a something more interesting that has a trade-off so move fast is interesting for us because we had to give something up to get it so the question is actually what are you willing to give up values are not free nothing is dude that's insane I mean what an insightful person to I mean he's just like an eloquent guy for how young he was I mean that's that's a that's a really good uh quote and so if I think about other great values that have like had resonance and stuck with people and meant something to people you know for example Nikes this is more of a slogan but just do it if you think about the the phrasing of just do it is is Nikes just do it as powerful if it just said do it or do things like it's it's very different right the word just changes it because just implies there's a cost just implies that that it's don't hit the snooze button don't don't shy away from it it's going to hurt it's going to be painful it's going to be uncomfortable but just do it and so I thought there's something to learn in that that's kind of inspiring for me so my my my essay was basically um if you want your culture your values to mean something and my friend Seiki has this great phrase he said culture is there's many ways to Define it but the best way is what do people do when the boss isn't around I I love that I thought that was pretty powerful it's your default behavior and uh if you want your default Behavior to to mean something to to be different to be a defining characteristic of your company that is different than the way other companies in your space operate here's the three-step formula which is you choose one thing not 10 things so for fast for Facebook it was moving fast for Apple it's thinking differently for for Nike it's action um then you make it real by acknowledging the cost or the trade-off and lastly you make it catchy you make it provocative you phrase it in a way that's going to turn heads so that's my that's my essay called painted chicken first that's awesome second have while you're on this little like value driven Mission driven company uh Quest have you heard of this company called Brunello Celli you probably haven't because it's not your stick opera singer who is that no it's this Italian company that makes really expensive cashmere clothing and their most F their most famous thing is like uh sweaters so it's I'm wearing a free t-shirt made out of 100% polyester from a YouTuber bro yeah that's why I knew it wasn't your stick but it's not my stick either but it kind of has is becoming it because I like it so much but Brunell Celli the founder started it because he was like an expert at I guess cashmere like he was I don't know what the term is but he he knew how to put together clothing and he basically was like you know my dad worked his ass off he was working seven days a week and I wanted to create a Humane workplace and so we're going to do that by creating these amazing sweaters where we hand Stitch and it's done perfectly what do you say it's done beautifully uh and he makes these really highend sweat and the clothing is great whatever but what's more interesting is this guy the founder and I just saw someone shared this uh photo of his schedule 6:00 am. wakes up at his Countryside home slowly gets stressed goes to the office at 8:30 and then he says at 1 I walk home for lunch uh then I take a 30- minute Siesta at 3 o'clock I go back to work at 5:30 the whole company stops working and takes the late afternoon walk because we believe that uh rest is super important to being uh Soulful and personal studies important as well he has light supper at 8:00 p.m. and from 9:00 p.m. he heads out to the cafe to meet friends where they discuss politics philosophy religion and other subjects late into the night and I was like is this guy legit is he the real deal he is so this company this sweater business it's a publicly traded company I didn't realize that it's a publicly traded company with a market cap of like4 billion do he's building his company to build a great workplace and to Great create great products not to make money first and it just because of that I want to give him more money and he's going to make more profit yeah I'm on the website right now and it's you know just from a swipe file like you know there's so many little things that they do in their brand and marketing that is uh congruent completely congruent with everything you just said one of the great marketing uh lessons I learned long time ago was somebody said yeah it's got to be Epoch I was Epoch what's Epoch epoc they every point of contact so they said once you decide what you what you're all about every point of contact meaning when somebody hits you on your if you're all about luxury but then your customer service hotline is like some janky old web form it's not every point of contact like I'm looking at for example one of the little gifts on the site for you know he's just like go go click on the sweater section or whatever it's this guy and it's a model but the model he's peeling an orange and he pops like an orange slice into his mouth he's just kind of wandering he's like walking a little slightly aimlessly he's just sort of like he's chilling he's not trying too hard he's enjoying himself he's right by the water and I'm like man the creative direction to say cuz you know normally what you said you have the founder who's got their beliefs then you have the revenue team that's trying to jack up revenue and they're adding popups on the website try to make it like you know improve conversion they have the creative director who's not even invited to the meetings and they're trying to do one thing over here and it is not congruent at all and people whether they can see it or not they feel it and you could feel when something is congruent it's the same reason the Apple Store looks the way way it does and the iPhone looks the way it does and the packaging looks the way it does and the commercials look the way they do it is congruent when it's done well as a brand but it's very rare to see that to be honest yeah these guys are on top of it now I like them uh I don't know if I want to spend like I'm looking at $1,500 for a polo uh I don't know if I'm there yet but uh I'm definitely thinking about it I maybe I'd buy maybe I'd buy a $2,000 sweater but like everything they have is high-end like it's one of he wants to attract a good customer and I think he has repelled me successfully I I would not be a good customer of this but you know what's cool you've said his his his schedule light supper light supper I don't think I've ever had a light supper I'm I'm eating heavy dinners over here and I just realized just changing the words if I said if I just change my words I said okay what am I gonna have for my light supper tonight I bet that would fix my diet just that one you change your words you change your life I bet you if I just change that one word light supper it wasn't even in my goddamn vocabulary until just now uh thank you I'll be taking that um is that it is that the pod that's it [Music]

so the quote is this it says most of us have two lives the life we live and the unlived life within us between the two stands the resistance more powerful than a locomotive and harder to kick than a crack crack cocaine habit and here's the biggest [ __ ] we don't even know what hit [Music] us all right Sam I got to ask you about this so I was watching that Leman Brothers play I don't know if you remember I was telling you I went and saw the Leman Brothers play and there's a line in there there's a part that's stuck with me the the point of the play is it's talking about the generations of the Leman brothers from the great-grandfather to the grandfather and I don't know if you know this story but basically they started out their their German immigrants they come to America they they land somehow in Alabama and they open up a small little store selling Fabrics okay so somehow they went from German immigrants who had nothing selling Fabrics in Alabama to the fourth or fifth biggest Investment Bank in New York in like a couple hundred years so how did that happen the story is how did that happen and the transition goes they're selling fabrics for you know for clothing in their store in Alabama and then they realize they could just buy the raw cotton so then they start going to plantations and buying the raw cotton and selling it to the guy who makes Fabrics out of it so then they become the largest buyer and seller of they become a middleman and they kind of like they in the play they say they invent the idea of middleman I don't think so but like they really popularized the idea of being a middleman where they weren't making the cotton nor were they making the Fabrics they were just in between brokering the deals and so then somehow that that ladds up and eventually they become a bank and so it's like generation two or three so what they show is it's realistic like one of the kids that took over was really smart had new ideas he's the one who turned it into a bank but there's other kids who was like maybe a little bit more of a gambler and a bit Reckless and that put them in positions that you know maybe they shouldn't have been in they got a little too greedy a little too aggressive which ultimately in 2008 Leman Brothers Falls and it's the biggest bank collapse in the history of the country it's because of you know some decisions that were made along the way the seeds that were planted by You Know The Heirs heirs to the throne so in one of the scenes it's the the kind of the older generation and then the younger generation they're both in the boardroom and at this point the older generation is kind of the figurehead he sits there in the boardroom but he's not the guy he's not the guy making the decisions his son is the guy making decisions and so if forgot who it is somebody ask them some some bank or someone else comes and ask them they say um what is your secret recipe what are the ingredients that let you do what you do and they think long hard and you know I forgot what answer they give but it's something like it's the people or it's the the trust that we have that's what that's the special ingredient and then the sun comes up and he goes in our you know when we're baking our flour is money some people use money to buy things we use money to make money our flower is money and like that was like one of the big transitions where they became a bank versus becoming before they were Merchants who were like buying and selling products buying and selling commodities and it shows that like once they have that realization like they never go back mean they just get more financialized more financialized more financialized where they're trading on computer screens and they're trading these subprime mortgages and they're never they're never issuing the mortgage they're not living in the house they're not they're just it's numbers in a spreadsheet from there on out basically and um and we've talked about this idea of like what is it that you sell and it kind of comes down to like the way I think about this is there's many moments in my life where I'm choosing between two paths the path that's opportunistic meaning I see green on the other side I see money on the other side and then maybe the path that's more interesting or fulfilling yeah ART versus money that's a good way of put it uh but for others it might be others might be impact it might be like making a difference in the world right might be the the fulfilling path for them so and as much as I could hear the advice like you know the answer the answer is go do the fulfilling thing however me and many people like me out there are just sway let me just make a quick pit stop over here and those pit stops add up you had one pit stop after another where you choose the opportunistic thing after after I make this money then I'll go do the thing or well this is too good to pass up right and I do that many many times in fact am still doing it today even as I am ashamed to admit it I do that all the time and so I wanted to talk a little bit about people who choose one path of the other yourself people you know well and see if I can get a little bit of wisdom on this um so do you have any stories on this or I can share maybe something I'm reading right now that that really stood out to me but where do you want to start I want to hear the story because I think you're reading a book that I've always wanted to read but I've refused to read it so far because I know what it's going to tell me and I don't like that answer because it's because it's hard it's a hard thing so you're reading uh is it the war in art by stepen pressfield yeah the war the uh war of art so it's like the opposite of of The Art of War sunu book so it's the war of Art and I wasn't going to read this book and then yesterday I um I asked Diego my my guy I was like Diego you read books he goes he goes not really but I'm reading this one book right now pretty good called The War of Art and I said give me the what's like one thing that stood out to you and he just screenshotted this passage that then I went and ran and tweeted out wait hold on so you're not actually reading the book you've just been inspired by one this is the trigger I'm just giving you the whole story here so I got the excerpt first which is actually a great way to to decide to read a book then I read half the book last night so it's a very fast read all right so the so the quote is this it says most of us have two lives the life we live and the unlived life within us between the two stands the resistance just like every Sun casts a shadow a genius's shadow is resistance resistance is faster than a speeding bullet more powerful than a locomotive and harder to kick than a crack crack cocaine habit and here's the biggest [ __ ] we don't even know what hit us I never did from the ages of 24 to 32 the resistance kicked my ass from the east coast to the West Coast back 13 times again and I never even knew it existed I looked everywhere for the enemy and failed to see it right in front of my face that makes you sad right well that's one reaction to it I felt the other way I felt like a inspired rage I was like no I'm not going to have the unlived life within so I pick up this book and I start reading and there are a ton of just like Banger passages that are uh they're just so good that I wanted to I wanted to you know talk a little bit about with you keep reading a few more what are the other good ones all right so the premise of the book if you didn't get it from that that is basically we have the thing that's our calling that we kind of know that we should do or the direction we know we should go and then there's us not doing it and that's maybe choosing what to work on but then there's just a dayto day so he'll point out like you know hey you got that diet that you haven't stuck to you got that that book that you haven't written you got that uh that that startup you want to go start you know of course you'll start it after you you know just save up a little more money and he goes you know fast forward the clock you're 40 50 60 years old and you're that great author that never wrote a book and he gives tips as well so he was like if you're going to be a writer you must write every day you don't not write because you don't feel good just like you don't do this other thing because like if you are just like feeling bummed you still got to go to work he he calls it the difference between an amateur and a pro he goes an amateur they do it because they love it that's what people think he's like oh they love it so much that they only do it once every month they love it so much that they never stick with it he goes you know who loves it the pro the pro who wakes up and shows up to work like it's like it's a job like treats it like it's a job you don't not show up to your job you do it every single day and you do it whether you feel like it or not you don't just wake up and decide am I going to do the thing or not today and so he talks about being a pro and how the pro sits down and quote unquote does the work and the work is he's like I don't care what it takes you know you basically you sit down and it you know it doesn't matter how long you sit there it doesn't matter if you wrote three lines it doesn't matter if those three lines suck you did the work today and that soon enough if you just do the work often enough those three lines turn into lines turned into 30 pages and those 30 pages turn into you know terrible just Mindless driil to you know your best work and the only way it gets there is by actually sitting down day by day and doing the work all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we' give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show do you follow Jerry Seinfeld at all because he's he talks about the about this topic all the time he's one of the few Comedians and actors and uh whatever you would describe him as that actually gets into the Tactical stuff uh of like what it goes through dayto day and he's like I have a a big pen and a yellow notebook and I and I write jokes like all day uh not all day he said I'll do like an hour a day but I try to get it done just a little bit every day and he goes most a time it's garbage and then he talks about when he was writing Seinfeld he was like I would go into the office I I would go to my office and I would sit down and I would actually write things out and then I had a process and he's like a lot of times I didn't want to do that but I just did it anyway because that's my job and I wanted and and I need to be great and so anyway he's a really good guy to follow because he gets really specific about the tactics uh behind this stuff which people rarely discuss have you ever seen this clip of him at a comedy club talking to a struggling comedian who's like asking he just caught Jerry backstage and asked him for some advice about how to make it yeah what's he say it's just like you get to a point like how much longer can I take it it's time running out you out of time getting older please getting older it's not it's not you can listen I'm I'm 29 I feel like i' I've sacrificed so much of my life the last 30 years you guys something else you would rather have been doing uh not other appointments or other places you got to be not necessarily not necessarily I see all my friends making a lot of money a lot of money on Wall Street I see like you know but I just see that like my friends are you know they're moving up and I don't I'm worried moving up moving up are you out of your mind no I'm not out of my mind I just uh least that's not going to do with your up no no it's a special thing my this has nothing to do with making it or did you ever stop and compare it in your life and go okay I'm 29 my friends are all married all having kids they're all have houses they they have some sort of sense of normality you what do you tell your parents what do you you know how do you feel with that they're parents yes [Music] I your parents let me tell you a story about uh this is my favorite story about Glen Miller's Orchestra they were doing some gig somewhere they can't land where they're supposed to land ENT a snowy night so they have to land like in this field and walk to the gig and they're dressed in their suits they're ready to play they they're carrying their instruments so they're walking through the snow and it's wet and it's slushy and in the distance they see this little house and there's lights on on the inside and there's a pear of smoke coming out of the chimney they go up to the house and they look in the window and in the window they see this this F he's a guy and his wife she's beautiful and there's two kids and they're they're all sitting around the table and they're smiling they're laughing and they're eating there's a fire in the fireplace and these guys are standing there in their suits and they're wet and they're shivering they're holding their intiments and they're watching this incredible Norman lovewell scene and one guy turns the other guy and goes how people live like that that's what it's about right and he just leaves the guy with this parable and the guy is just like you know stunned basically but the point is like this guy says that he's doing the thing that he loves but he's like jealous of the of the comfortable people who are who are not living that life basically and like the true artists the people who are going to make make the great [ __ ] the people who are going to live their sort of the their most fulfilled life they're the ones marching through the snow in the discomfort but they're doing exactly the thing that they want to be doing they chose this discomfort and um I love that story I'm going to remind you of something that we did so in February I think it was the Lego episodes so if you could go my first million Lego at the very end you had said something of like I forget exactly what you said but it was something where I remember the energy being I own this company um that I'm not sure if it gives me purpose uh and it's not really related to my main thing and I said uh well you know the product that you're selling doesn't necessarily have to be uh something you're passionate about you could be passionate about creating great jobs or you could be passionate about uh creating a wonderful place to work making it so your employees can afford a car whatever you know that it doesn't always have to save the world and I think that kind of helped you a little bit and I was reflecting on it because I talked to Brett Adcock the other day when you w't here it's gonna go live after this episode I think so Brett Adcock uh started figure it's a humanoid robot company that like it's one of those companies that you would Peg as like it's going to change the world whatever he did two things that were interesting the first thing is I tried to nag them a little bit to get like some good content out of them and I go Brett you know you're doing this world changing thing now but before this you had a company called V which basically is just like a glorified job board and he laughed and he he knew I was just giving him a hard time and it was a hundred million dollar company it was a great exit and he explained how figur is changing the world and how he was thinking about doing uh artificial meat so meat that you grow in a lab he was like I was worried about these really big problems and I go well veter was not a big problem and he was like he kind of laughed but then he got serious and he goes uh well the way that I thought about it was that you know you spend 50 hours full hours a week away from your family with a company you should be spending it on something that you really truly love and enjoy and that you get value out of and I was like you did it again man you just wo this story around something that makes it really inspirational and world changing is he saying that the job board is helping people find that that's what he was saying or he was saying he got he got that out of it he got that out of it and he was like and it's not really a job board it's significantly more complex than that but I wanted to like just give him a hard time to get get get them to come out of a shell but he was saying like he's like well no it's not just a job board like we weren't just helping people get jobs we were helping them find Value in their lives and helping them find passion and he did such a good job of telling himself a story that I also believe I believe his story to be true and the other thing and anyway it inspired me of like telling myself a story these vegetables aren't just crackers with cheese if you think about what makes a sandwich you must ask yourself do I need all of it or could I reduce it in size could I have could I do more with less what is enough and that's what the Lunchable stands for it's a reminder of what is enough that's exactly what he did and I thought it was great but then he's got this new thing so his new thing uh it's called cover so if you go to cover. it says cover is a AI security company developing concealed weapon detection systems covers technology scans students backpacks I think for concealed weapons in K through 12 schools our goal is to prevent school shootings by identifying concealed weapons inside of bags and underneath clothing apply to work here listen to this so he had just sold one of his companies or no sorry one of his companies went public it was called Archer it was uh basically an electric helicopter big deal it's a big deal and he was thinking what am I going to work on he had three ideas idea number one was Meats grown in a lab which we've talked about which is like it's pretty insane that you have have to have all these cows in order to get ground beef is there a way that you can make real beef in a lab he was really fascinated by that and he read a bunch of research he's like that that that's on my short list but that's not the one I'm going to do the second idea that he had was robots where he was like uh we just can't get enough uh warehouse workers to fill these jobs I wonder if a robot can uh fulfill this uh demand that's what he ended up doing the third one that he didn't do that he was very close to doing he read this study he read this study that was done I think or a research paper done in 2014 or 12 or something like that and basically it was about NASA creating this technology that could use not exactly x-rays but almost like a like a cellular phone like uh like cell phone rays and from 50 meters away so about 150 feet this thing that looks like a video camera can you a human being can walk in front of it and you could see if they have a bomb on them you can see if they have a weapon on them you could see if they have anything underneath their clothes or in their backpacks and he goes That's amazing I wonder what we could use that for he saw this graph about school shootings where basically there's something like a school shooting a day and I'm not talking necessarily school shootings where it's like predetermined where I'm going to go and I'm GNA like you know have be overly violent to 30 children I'm talking about like kids who just have a gun in their book bag at school and someone says something rude to them and they freak out and someone gets hurt and shot and he was like that's what we need to solve that uh we need to solve that problem and so he didn't end up taking uh and running with that idea he did figure however figure's kind of working a little bit and he has a little bit extra money and so he went and Cole called the NASA guy who created this research report that explained the technology and he convinced the guy to let Brett come and check the technology out he has now since licensed it and he's funded cover. with $10 million of his own money and he's hired a team of NASA Engineers to build technology to build this stuff out So eventually they're going to start with going to stadiums so you can see if someone's coming into a stadium with a weapon and then they want to like give away that technology to schools to prevent school shootings because schools don't exactly have money to afford this software and he was telling me this story and I'm like who wouldn't want to prevent school shootings that's like the greatest thing ever uh that's a that's a really hard thing to compete against when I'm recruiting an employee to come and join a newsletter business versus like going to like literally save lives and it got me thinking of what what what I was saying to you about well a company doesn't have to be X Y and Z I felt that was a cope I felt that when I heard what Brett was doing I felt solving big problems and going after your passion and not exactly caring about how big of an opportunity is in some regards in some ways that is better than doing it the way that we you and I tend to do it well I I think that um what Brett stone is pretty awesome here he he did it as a uh you know we talk about one chart businesses that's exactly what I told him on the podcast I go Sean's going to love this yeah it's it's a one chart business because uh we we talked about this before which is some businesses the best businesses really are so simple that you could just put up a single chart on the screen and say that's why we're doing this and the example we gave before was that the rise of uh cremation so crem cremated funerals has grown from like you know less than 10% of the market to over 50% of the market now the majority of funerals I guess in the US are are cremations which is surprising to me still uh but if you're creating a business that's around that which we we we met these guys um I think after was the name of them and like they had a whole deck and I told them I was like you didn't need to send the deck this slide three was enough all you had to show me was that and say we enable this we make it easier to do cremation like look at this rise that's what we're doing and so the best businesses are one chart businesses I know a lot of people that did DDC Brands and if you ask them about their DTC brand they'll tell you this and that about the market that they're in and about the business model about the direct relationship with the consumer all they needed to show was time spent on Facebook that's all these markets were based on was time spent on Facebook Facebook and the CPM on Facebook that's a single chart would have told you that hey there's a new way to reach customers and it's called Facebook ads and we're going to just work backwards from Facebook ads and start selling products via Facebook ads that's really what happened in DC over the last 15 years any anyway so when I asked Brett about like this idea I was like oh so give me the pitch what's the thesis around this what are you what are you excited about he goes oh it's this Google image and he just searched school shootings per year pulled up the chart he goes and it's just a it's like a up into the right exponential like it's like a it's what you want a startup growth curve to look like you know it starts really small and it starts getting bigger and bigger bigger except it's school shooting so you want it to go in the opposite direction and uh because I was like dude how do you have the time don't you just want to go take a nap like you want to be with a kids but like even if you're not with your kids [ __ ] it take a nap dude like why do you why do you're already working doing one insane thing compe with Elon Musk how dare you go start another hard thing and he's like well I have to I feel like compelled to yeah and when I think about like uh you know this isn't actually realistic but I when I think about a company trying to compete with Brett when you're recruiting someone it makes it really hard and I asked them I go uh why do you do these big things he goes well I think big things in many ways are easier uh it's easier when I have this crazy awesome mission to get employees investors customers like it's just it's just actually easier and it kind of it messed with my mind a little bit so my takea away from that by the way is not that you have to go solve a really gnarly problem in the world to be doing something um I think that is definitely One path and the way I think about it instead is instead of saying what should I do a better question is what would I do if I wasn't afraid like if I wasn't afraid what would I go work on and usually you're afraid of failure usually you're afraid of it not working out usually you're afraid that it might be too hard like so for some people it might be starting a humanoid Rob company might be the answer but you're not doing it because you're too afraid that like it's too hard I don't really know how to do that it's it'll take too much money what if I can't raise it what if I do this or if I do that I'm competing with Google and and Elon and all these people and so they wouldn't do it and for other people like for me it's a creative Endeavor right it's to say well what like I don't know I think the thing I really want to do is go write this killer book or go make a TV show or go do something really really interesting and the reason I don't do it is because it might fail right I might spend a couple years writing a book and it comes out and people are like yeah cool book man and that's it that would be disappointing and that would be the failure and I think one of the good things about um about this book that I was reading the war of Art and uh some other stuff I've been consuming is you you really separate the like choice of what you do and the result of what you do as two different things and like you know you control the controllables the thing you can control is did you spend the time doing the thing you really wanted and did you give it your all you cannot control the outcome and if you listen to Rick rubben talk he says the exact same thing he goes your job is not to make it popular popular is not something you do you don't make popular you make stuff and you make a lot of stuff and you put your best stuff out there and you do your best job doing the best stuff you can and popular I mean that's not even something you think about that just happens or it doesn't happen and it's irrelevant at that point whether it happens or doesn't happen because you're just going to keep making stuff and eventually popular starts to pay attention to the guy who's making a lot of stuff um we talked about Rocky in last episode The Story of Sylvester Stallone so after the episode I went and did like a deep dive on it I went and I watched Rocky last night and I watched all of his old interviews from the 1970s and I really got into it and there was so many good parts but the one thing that he said he's interview he's being interviewed by this guy and this is the movie come out it's it's been a success at this point and he but it's like a year in and he says you know so they offered you a lot of money for this and you needed money we talked about how he had to sell his dog because his do he had a big like Mastiff and was eating too much he's like either I'm not going to be able to feed the dog and not feed myself or I sell the this dog and then I could feed myself and hopefully the new owner will be able to feed my dog and as much as it killed him to do it he's like I I have no choice here so he was like down to the dumps and he the way he says it he goes I had $106 in my bank account I had a $300 a month rent and I had a pregnant wife and he goes the wolf was at the door I love that phrase he goes the wolf was at the door why did you because they're like how did you write it in three and a half days the the the V1 of the script he goes the wolf was at the door I had no choice and so he um and they were like but then they offered you money for this like a lot of money for this he goes yeah they go how much do they offer you he goes well first they offered me about 100,000 and I said No and then they came back 150,000 they're why'd you say no he goes well they said we'll take the script but like you know you go away we we will go get Bert Reynolds to to be Rocky like we don't need you to be Rocky we like the script no that's who they went to uh they went to Bert Reynolds they went they went to three or four guys who were big at the time and he's like no I only want to give you this script if I'm going to be Rocky and they were like oh God okay forget it then they came back 150,000 but you're not Rocky no then the final offer was $265,000 but you're not Rocky and he says no and they go he goes how did you say no to $265,000 when you1 that's like 800 Grand now yeah exactly it's like a million bucks basically and they they were like uh how did you say no when you had $106 in the bank he said a couple lines he goes he goes um it's not he go it's not that hard to say no to money when youve never had money you don't even even know what money is he goes he goes if you've never ridden in a Rolls-Royce you don't mind bumping around in a Volkswagen it's all you know he's like I goes I didn't have a frame of reference for that he goes I did want to get out of some misery he's like my land lady was a a big just Beast of a woman and she would you know she would show up at my door every month and her she was so large she cast almost like a shadow at the door he's like and I just remember being afraid of that shadow all the time he's like but I you know my goal was rent my goal wasn't $265,000 I didn't need all that and goes um they go but you know they go did you ever have any doubts he goes yeah he goes before when I was telling them no I was saying are you kidding me Bert Reynolds that guy like I can out act all these people I will kill this role I will be so good in this role you you guys have never seen anybody act like I act and then as soon as they finally relented and they were like cool um you know you can do the movie they B what by the way the deal they ended up doing was a million dollars of production budget which was very little at the time like the big movie at the time King Kong was like 25 million won only had a milon budget he produced the whole thing for 960,000 and he like casted his brothers and his uncles and like you know they did one take on everything and like if they couldn't get something like there's a scene where they're they're supposed to be ice skating on a date but uh Rocky he didn't didn't know how to ice skate they like you don't have time to learn uh so they they just changed the scene where he's walking and she's ice skating and they like made an they just changed the script to why that would make sense and they just brought cameras to an ice rink and stuff like that probably like to get his dog back he cast that guy in the movie plus gave him money it was like all you going to be in the movie so the guy's in the movie for like one line so anyways he's making this movie for for less than a million bucks U they go well now you've made a lot of money right he goes he's he's laughing he goes I about $400 more than I had before this they go $400 he goes yeah I mean I I had a lot of bills before this and that land lady cast in that shadow she showed up for the rent and then taxes and then all this he goes he goes but you know what he goes it he goes I basically paid myself the um stage Actors Guild minimum the SAG minimum so he made $600 a week doing the movie and I think he owned the like some percentage but it was going to be on the back end so he didn't have the money yet and so he goes uh he goes but you know what the money never mattered he goes I would have done this whole thing for a doughnut and a tuna fish sandwich the money meant nothing it was always about the opportunity I had to prove to myself that I wasn't a liar that I wasn't living a life of disillusionment because that's very difficult CU I thought of myself as a creative person and I told myself that I was a great actor but I had never had an opportunity to go f figure out am I any good or not and so when you ask me should I take the money or should I take the opportunity to find out am I living the life of a liar or not I had to get that answer because if if not it would have eaten at me for the rest of my life he goes I'm I think of myself as a creative person I didn't want to wake up and be 50 years old and realize that I'm this creative person who's never done anything creative that would be terrible I'd be living a lie it would kill me dude is is he our new kind of crush move over BR Adcock yeah Sylvester salon's my guy now and he looks great amazing uh the dude these interviews are so good like I'm gonna make a separate YouTube video just as like a homage to to to sly because he's got so much swag which I didn't realize he's very funny and by the way this is another thing I love about the guy he not only did all this stuff but he kind of overcame the adversity right so the reason he wasn't getting casted is because he talks funny well why does he talk funny do you know the story didn't when he was born or no didn't he h he hit his face or he was born with like no nerves on one side of his face right when he was born they used forp to get him out forp damage the nerve and it's the nerve in your mouth that when you go for a dental procedure they numb you and you know you like your tongue doesn't move right you can't talk right imagine that for your whole life that was his whole life and so because he was really jacked and because he talked with kind of a slur and like a sort of his mouth part of his face part of his mouth is paralyzed people assumed he was dumb this guy was incredibly intelligent he was very well read he wrote the script for this he is a very creative eloquent person he's a great writer and people just thought of him as this action hero like this like uh you know like an action figure basically oh you got abs and muscles and that's why you're why you're doing these rols but that's not it at all this guy was a very deep and interesting person but he was sort of masked by this maybe my doctor used forceps and [ __ ] cuz I slur everything and I have abs as well and I'm kind of smart yo Adrian y Adrian that was pretty good I think I think my my doctor also must use that same tool was I born in New Jersey as well um I want to tell you a story about an interesting person I hung out with but before I get to that this is kind of the inspiration episode it seems and you feel inspired you know but it's sometimes it's hard to feel inspired when it's 105¬∞ and I'm sitting in Austin Texas sweat my ass off what would you do Sean if you wanted to feel inspired maybe write a book maybe get away from it all what would you do I writing a book seems hard I'd get away but but where would I go I think I would wander today's sponsor is wanderer.com we like wander so go to wander uh am I even saying that funny by the way do am I saying that with a weird accent you didn't stillone it you're good um so wanderer.com um it's a really cool website where they operate really luxurious high-end properties they're awesome if you go to their website you'll see every photo they take is inspiring like all these beautiful beaches like a cabin in the mountains it's just like high-end stuff and they've got gyms and work sometimes I don't even take the trip I just go to wanderer.com just look at places and I get like 10% of what it would feel like to go on vacation right now and it's like okay well that just took me 10 minutes that was great yeah my wife wanted to go to Greece and I was like hey let's just look at Google Earth and look at the parking like pretty dope right did that do yeah that that's what I do with uh with wanderer.com so check it out they're today's sponsor they're an awesome company um I want to tell you a quick story about what I did the other day so I get this text this guy Michael just joined Hampton and I become became friendly with him and he's like hey are you free on Tuesday at six o'clock I was like yeah sure what's up he goes do you want to go fishing uh I was like yeah okay whatever uh I like I'm currently uh right outside of New York City so I'm like where do we get like do we fish like is it going to be like sewage water where do you fish I I I don't know so I go to this guy's house it looks like I'm at like a high school or an art museum he's got this massive beautiful home that's built like on a peninsula and the boat to get into the the Long Island Sound which is like a body of water right here he it's like right on his front porch and we're basically 30 minutes outside of New York City it was one of the most spectacular things that I've ever heard of and so we go out fishing and I get to know him a little bit and I had to tell you about this guy so he's really fascinating because he's one of those guys who you know his products but you may not have ever heard of him so have you ever heard of uh fog Creek software they launched in 2010 as like so fog Creek software launched in 2000 and it was sort of like an agency where the internet was just getting started and these guys were like the early nerds amongst amongst the Nerds so if you wanted like some the development work they were the guys their mission early on was like you know we want to work with programmers and we want to create create a great place to work for programmers and they start this little agency or a consultancy but like a lot of Consultants they're like just doing service work kind of sucks let's create some products and so they create a handful of products the first one being fog bugs so fog bugs was like a a bug tracking software and after 10 years it does all right it's like you know in the eight figure so 10 million plus in Revenue it's doing pretty good but it's kind of stagnates a little bit and they go let's like spit off some more stuff that we've been working on so I believe I don't remember which order it was but let's just say the first one was Trello so they spin off Trello and they fund it with a little bit of money so Trello it's an asonic competitor it's a uh task management software they grow this business they raise only $10 million uh it gets started and they and they grow it a little bit then they raise $10 million they grow this business and they eventually sell it to atlassian software for $450 million I believe and if you look at atlassian software stock I think when they sold the stock was $17 and when it eventually peaked uh like last year two years ago whenever thing when everyone went crazy it was like 20x set and so they got a combination of stock and cash for this deal so huge hit this guy just made it Well turns out they spun off another company as well and that other company was called stack Overflow so stack Overflow was basically like it's still exists it's kind of like a message board but originally for developers and eventually you can make one of these message boards for a variety of topics it's huge did you know that that company sold this wasn't in the news too often but did you know that company sold for $1.8 billion who bought it uh uh a European publishing company uh pro pro process Pro I don't know are you you have it up no I don't have it here but that's okay just some insane traffic by the way they get almost like 200 million monthly visitors huge site and so I was talking to this guy and he was like yeah then we also sold sold fog Creek software and I made a little money there so he's like I've had a hatrick and so this guy has done all these amazing things and so just like learning about his Story how he's pretty low-key in the sense that like he he doesn't have Twitter he doesn't really use social media and he's like giving me all this like interesting Intel on growing their companies and making him huge it's called proess according to Ari um and he's like yeah I sold that one we sold that one for 1.8 we sold this one for you know 400 and something but the stock like appreciated a ton so who knows what the actual price was and I was like what are you doing now and he's like just fishing just to thinking and so he goes fishing on this boat like every day during work hours and he's like showing me a tour his home and he's like yeah this is where my office was but I don't really open up a laptop anymore did you know this guy or why is he inviting you fishing I met him in Hampton and we just started talking and he just was like do you want to do you want to come over and I guess this is look when you're you look like a guy likes to fish like spotted I thought here's why this guy was cool to me he's like an Outdoorsman in basically New York City and he's like living a very unique life uh and it just but he's very zen-like he's super Zen and he was telling me stories about how he like overcame certain things at the company the whole time he's like telling you stories he sounds really Zen and calm and low-key and I thought that this this guy was one of these people who deserves a little bit of love because super under the radar as successful as anyone we've talked on this podcast but does not have a big mouth so I'm kind of uh blowing up his spot a little bit but I I asked him if it was all right that I said all this and super interesting guy that you should look into Michael prior is his name he's awesome what was um anything cool from your conversation anything you you learned or an Insight or an observation you had that made you think yeah so he was uh I just liked how lowkey he was about everything so he was basically the CFO of stack overflow stack Overflow I don't know what their revenue was but they sold for $2 billion doar and I was like did you are you like an accountant did you were you a CFO he's like no I barely knew how to do any of this stuff uh but the company needed a CFO when we started he's like I was a programmer he's like I haven't programmed in forever but I just kind of learned like to pay taxes and I just had to learn how to pay taxes and I had to learn how to do payroll and he just like rolled with the punches and I think that uh I was like were you intense he's like no I'm not intense at all and we hear stories about how people are doing what do Elon must say hardcore hardcore mode hardcore and this guy he was like I'm not I wasn't really hardcore he's like we were smart and we worked pretty hard but like I would not describe what we did as intense and we just kind of R rolled with the punches it was really cool to hear something that differs from the loudest people who are incredibly successful of being intense you got to grind you got to do this that wasn't the vibe that I got from Michael and like the early founding of these companies and I thought it was really inspiring I thought it was awesome I also think and this is for anyone who wants to build a company you have to look up his partner his partner's the louder one his partner is called uh is named Joel Joel and he's got this amazing blog that I've read for years it's basically like Paul Graham but more a little bit uh a little bit more hotheaded a little yeah well it is it's very tactical but he also writes like he he he's a little bit more jokey and it's a little bit more Brash which I appreciate and it's called Joel on software I think it's one of the best entrepreneur blogs out there I don't even think he updates it anymore but he has probably a thousand articles and so it was awesome just like hearing little bits of like Intel from these guys and so I wanted to uh shine a light on this guy it was really fascinating yeah that's amazing uh that's cool how's your fishing game dude it was like on easy mode like the poles were like attached to the boat and it was like once you once you hear like a bell rig you just go and grab like you like grab the thing and just like barely crank it in it's like the door dash of fishing yeah like his boat like told me where the fish was like it gives you like a little alert so it's like fish here and you just like sit there I'm just like sitting drinking water and it's like oh we got a fish I guess and so oh did you see the picture of it it was three foot long this [ __ ] fish I saw that thing and I was like how the hell did you catch this what what is going on that was like a record cat that was like a record setting fish it was just like the fishing rod was just like in one of the holes on the boat and you just like barely touched the Reel and it came up I mean it really there was really no glory in it it's like AI for fishing it's like wait a minute yeah like like the boat these I don't know anything about boats a lot of people look at me they think that I'm like an Outdoorsman I don't know [ __ ] about this stuff and like it like has these sensors that tell you where the [ __ ] fish are like there was no work involved so like this fishing shit's easy I don't know why people are impressed by this let me ask you one more question I'm always interested in what other PE what other interesting people are interested in what was this guy interested in when he was talking to you what kind of questions did he ask you we talked about being popular so basically like a lot of people who are why you ask you good question I think I was like uh uh the tallest [ __ ] here like where I was just I was like the only one that he could like uh talk to whoever who has even a slight popularity we were talk so I found it odd that and I don't think he actually envied me at all nor does he want this type of thing but a lot of like rich and successful people who are low-key are curious what it's like to have an audience and what I tell them all the time and I don't know if you feel this way I go hey I will trade you my audience for your Networth any any day of the week I'll gladly make that trade and of course none of them would ever actually want to do that but I think it's funny and and I'm I'm not talking about him but people in general uh that they're into what it's like to have like an audience and be internet popular or something like that and I always remind them I'm like it's really just like me in my bedroom just or on my toilet just typing out stupid tweets and like there's like not that much joy in it and I would I I would much rather have A2 billion dollar company and so don't get like don't actually Envy this or think that it's awesome and so a lot of these people are curious what it's like to be like a a popular internet person um let me ask you a question hypothetical how much would somebody have to pay you to never create content again delete everything on this podcast delete your blog and never you never get to publish again no Twitter no social media no nothing how much would you have to get paid $30 million what about you a really specific number very quick and specific number well I had to think about it I had to think about what it's worth for half a second well I had to think about what you know what it's worth what would you would your number be I think 100 no think more than 100 I think it would have to be like yeah I think it would have to be more than dude you are not Sylvester Salone you are not you are not Sylvester Salone you you you don't have the landlord's not here like you've tasted the nice life you want more of it you would do it for much less no no I I really wouldn't so your official number is 250 250 that's insane to me I do not believe dude that's like you'd be no no no no no no I think you I think you are full of [ __ ] I think you are absolutely you take power of attorney and change my decision for me I just don't like sorry my friend's an idiot I'm gonna change that number why why why why because I think I'm GNA end up at 100 to 200 anyways doing what I'm doing and I like doing it so it's basically if I think I'm going to make that anyways doing this um and I like doing it so then you have to pay me a premium on top of to make me stop doing a thing I like doing and then there's the additional like time value of money that I get it all upfront right now guaranteed right so so you know I'm just kind of factoring that in and I would just rather air on the side of um what's a number I would not I would not regret like what what's a number you could pay me that I okay I'll go figure out some other Hobbies well would you still be allowed to do anything anonymously like under a pen name no no your your hands are taped you can't you can't type can't can't do any of that stuff yeah maybe it would be higher then like if I could if I could do something anonymously I would do that I think that um I think the anonymous thing is actually pretty cool it might be better anyways I think it's better anyway I think the anonymous thing is cool I'm really fascinated by these authors who use pen names so we had uh Jack Carr on the podcast that's a pen name um but it like was it a pen name because it's a stage name or is a pen name because he wants to be anonymous in real life I imagine the second one of course he's not anonymous because like we see his face but yeah I think it's just a stage name uh which is different I don't know what you call it yeah I don't know but I just know that's not his Jack car just sounds cooler you know I I remember I was in a movie Once dude my name rhymes with that why does his name sound so much cooler it's the C it's the the k sound right K is the coolest letter everybody knows that um I was in a movie once and the main actor was Cal pen and I was like oh man Cal pen what a guy Cal pen what a name sounds like a hero sounds like a Hollywood star Cal pen dude that guy's not you know what his real name is is he's his name is like culpen sesh Modi that's his real name he couldn't get auditions and so they changed instead of his first name being uh Gulpin they changed it to Cal pen and then all of a sudden he started getting auditions and he was telling me this like he was like embarrassed by not embarrassed by but he was like effed up that this is what we had to do he's like I didn't want to change my name I just wanted to act and the price of having to Act was to change my name and this is super common like Mindy King her name is not actually Mindy King uh like a bunch of Asian actors same thing like they all Chang they all change their name to sound cooler and more uh you know whatever in fact Leonardo DiCaprio that they tried to get him to change his last name they wanted him to be like Lenny Williams was what they wanted to seem to be and he refused and so we we were almost robbed of Leonardo DiCaprio he was about to be [ __ ] Lenny Williams if he had listened to the to the suits Lenny Williams would have been so much worse for him cuz Lenny Williams sounds like a 50-year-old who dates a 19-year-old Leonardo Le Leonardo DiCaprio is a 50-year-old at least there's some Suave or whatever you know like for some reason wait is that illegal no he's kind of Italian I think so it's okay last name is different so I guess if we question it Lenny Williams sounds like like a 50-year-old guy who watches on TV you know what I mean like yeah he did the right thing Leonardo DiCaprio he pulled it off good job for him um do we end here on this rambling wandering uh podcast I think so I think that's it all right that's the pod [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
if you had to describe yourself as an entrepreneur what would you say you are I just want to go build important things and win that's it so you just raised $675 million and I feel like that's a monster business let's talk about this for a minute we talk about one chart businesses where you like you see some crazy chart and you're like oh well there's like an opportunity several hundred, guns are being brought into schools in kt12 every year in the US and not found and the the chart if you look like a line graph of the chart it's just like exponential what's your answer for that this is like the first time I've talked about this publicly [Music] um we're live with Brett Adcock I wanted to start off with something crisp you told me this story and this is something that's fascinating about you which is about your ability to learn so I think I don't want to butcher the story but you said something like I was reading old I think research papers and you found that I think in the 70s NASA came up with this amazing thing and you cold called or cold emailed NASA and you're like can you actually show me this device is that story right uh yeah it's pretty close this is like the first time I've talked about this publicly um so starting from maybe from like for context I have been kind of following what's happening at K through2 schools in the US is released to school shootings and if you look at the charts of like you know how many shootings are actually happening at the schools how many deaths are happening at schools it's it's it's it's like basically you have like a school shooting like basically once per day now in the US in K through2 that's true is that true that's insane that's insane we're like I think it was like 200 over 200 people like um last year were like either shot or wound or or wounded or killed in the US at k through2 and a third of those are all in elementary and the chart if you look like a line graph of the chart it's just like exponential it's uh we we like 5x in 2018 uh kind of almost a year over year and then we like took another 3x move so we basically 10x the number of school shootings uh over the last um like seven years or so decade and it's just getting worse and worse what I found is that most of all the school shootings are not what we're seeing on TV where you know there's um a over assault where somebody's bringing in like a machine gun uh planned it out driving a truck in campus and shooting people up that's that's that's that's we that happens a few times a year 90 90 99 98% of all the other shootings are from a kid bringing a handgun in every day to school they're getting in a fight at some point and escalates some into a shooting so they're just like it's like a it's like it's like a accessory it's like like bringing a right third friend they have a handgun in their backpack and but from our analysis several hundred thousand guns are being brought into schools in kt12 every year in the in the US and not found and then a small fraction of those that we see now in the statistics are H are basically getting in like bullied or getting a fight and they're shooting somebody on school campus so one of my hobbies I love reading like research papers papers in general um and uh the way I think you solve this is you need to be able to see the guns I think gun control is something like interested in passionate about but I think it's not going to fix all school shootings forever there was like last year 70 nice stabbings in ky2 schools so like you know even if you halted guns there's still like knif stabbings happening here so we need to see the weapons so I was reading um I came across a research paper from NASA's jet propulsion lab where they were doing work where they were trying to detect um bomb vests and weapons underneath uh like garments and clothes and jackets uh for like Afghanistan and Iraq and they developed some really interesting like weapons imaging technology and I flew to JPL like NASA Jeet propulsion lab and Pasadena and I was talking to the the guy that ran it did you just C cold email him or something oh yeah cold called them for sure yeah and what did you say oh I said hey I I I need to I need to learn more about this I write your paper can we have a conversation uh you know most people in general will get on a phone with you at this point like if you're passionate about some work they did for years years and years that they're no longer doing like somebody's going to take a phone call I think I think most people could knock on that door and get that person to react um yeah I don't think that's a hard thing to do uh called him and I flew in and the high level was that they developed um a high frequency radar so similar like your Wi-Fi or phone like um like it's like it like lies in electromagnetic spectrum so uh like radio waves basically that were really high frequency so like think about like your phone or Wi-Fi but like really souped up to like much higher frequency level and they were able to start penetrating clothing and see start like Imaging or building or reconstructing images of what's Happening inside of bags underneath clothing and stuff and if you like read the research papers you look at it it's like it's like a it's like a airport security uh cam like airport security but like you can do it uh 50 meters away and you can do it like a camera and you can take like almost like camera frame rate images which means you could just like point this at an interest of a school in this example and you can see every gun and knife and bomb and it doesn't need to be metallic it doesn't need metal it could be plastic it could be any material is it radio waves it's radio waves is that dangerous if you have ionized uh electrinic waves uh like you would see x-ray yes these are non ionizing Rays like almost like your cell phone and Wi-Fi so these are not yeah I mean listen they worked on it for like for like years and years and I think at the end of it was like 2013 or so so it's like when I got there I was like we were talking and chatting and didn't even think to ask to see the machine and at the end of the conversation he's like do you want to come see it and I'm like of course and we like walk down like four flights of stairs to the basement he uh you know takes the cover off it's dusty it's like a huge like compact computer at the bottom and all this old stuff like all all the electronics and all the systems and stuff are like very dated he turns it on and demos for me uh he we have like a mannequin with a gun underneath a shirt and he shows me it and it was like it was unbelievable it was like it was like it was like a camera picture of the gun but then we also had like you also with radio frequency we get a we get a 3D reconstruction so you're almost get like a camera Point cloud of the product was this before you were going to do figure where you were like this is like my number one or number two or number three idea or something like that this was a while ago and I've been mostly curious about the space and then what happened from like 2018 to now is we've seen like a 5x spike in number of school shootings so like the the chart of school shootings is like looking like a like Nvidia stock price well we talk about an MFM we talk about one chart businesses where you like you see some crazy chart and you're like oh well there's like an opportunity and it's like well if you just there's a tidal wave if you just sort of catch that wave and you aren't even that good like the Market's like pulling it out of you like everyone just wants this thing so that was like your one your kind of one chart where it's like oh well this is obvious somebody came in to figure at one point and in 2023 it was an investor and he was looking at solutions for school shootings like just coincidentally and they were basically at the time looking at a startup that was using like cctvs like basically the cameras that are as a school to find guns the problem is like all the guns are hidden so whenever you like branish a weapon or pull it out and wave it around you're you're at a point where like a second later you're shooting it so you can't stop the shootings you can just get more prepared about how to get there faster Maybe to the right location maybe stop like save some lives if the shooting lasts for a long period of time you're not like you're not stopping weapons from getting in school you're not theoretically even stopping real shootings so I was telling him about my experience here and the guy like looked me dead in the face and he's like listen as somebody has kids like H how are you not like trying this and seeing if you can make this really work and yeah so at that time I said I I got to figure out how to spend some time and money making this useful and so is that what you're going to do you're launching this as a startup are you going to have someone else run it what are you going to do yeah so we haven't announced this yet but like it is we have about 12 people on the project and we own all the inustrial property from NASA's Jeff propulsion lab licensed all of it um and we will have our first system brought up to start Imaging weapons uh in 30 days are you going to run it who's going to run it we have a team from JPL that's running the system running there right now I I don't think that business can be as big as figure but I feel like that's a monster business let's talk about this for a minute um this is not a school thing this is uh stadiums churches um anywhere it's like a lot of uh like hospitals everything so so my view of this is um over long enough period of time as longevity improves for humans the um the the RIS the severity to having an accident and dying is going to be higher and higher meaning um we're not going to want to do more riskier things as we can live longer it's why in the movies if somebody's Immortal they're like living in their home they don't leave uh because if you die you're you're dead forever and if you don't die you're like alive forever right now we have like a some finite period of time where we won't we won't be alive anymore so humans take a lot of risks we drive cars that are extremely dangerous and motorcycles we do all this you do motorcycles we do all this like stupid stuff that like has pretty high I would say you know pretty high risk but if that if you were going to live forever like you wouldn't be doing that stuff I would say over a long enough period of time I don't think you'll really move through the world without imagy systems like this for safety all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we give a a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show you're really good at like telling a story so you you did this before when I've hung out with you about humanoids and robots and you just like you tell these stories that are so Grand I just get bought into and I'm like well that makes perfect sense but you do it at a much larger scale so you went with like the longevity angle which is like well we're going to live much I mean that's just such like a challenging way to think for a lot of people myself included and it's just such an EAS like when I hear that pitch I think yeah of course that makes wonderful sense it and it makes me it makes me think going big and having these Grand Visions is almost easier than not than not than doing the alternative something smaller do you know what I mean it's 100% easier you can hire better people because they're more ambitious and they're interested in working out harder things um they're generally larger could be larger outcomes you're talking about like you know building like new industries that maybe never have been built before with huge Tams uh investors want like very high risk reward trades where they can make you know 50 100 times of their money um you know most investments from BCS fail so they really need like the hundred bagger in their portfolio uh big Grand things offer that risk reward opportunity for investors um yeah I have this ly I think harder things are easier and I think um it really depends what industry and what Market you're going into but relatively speaking I think it's there's some there's some truth in that yeah because vety was uh you sold veter for $100 million that's a big outcome that's a big outcome for virtually everyone they're like that's a life-changing thing but it doesn't have an inspirational angle to it necessarily I mean no I think like listen outside of spending time with loved ones we're at work most of our Lives as humans most people we are most people don't like where they work if you've ever look for a job it's like the worst process we talk about bad like bad products looking for a job is is embarrassing it's uh it's like Soul crushing so what we try to do at better is like if we can get all the world's employers together with all the candidates in the world we can use AI to make matches at scale and find the best opportunity for you with machine learning and if you can solve that you could put people in much better places for employment much happier places like they can find jobs they really love yeah I mean you just I would have pitched it as a a sick job board and you just totally like make it to be some really inspirational thing but that even as good as you are at pitching that that pales a comparison to I think to like when you pitch this this uh this x-ray machine whatever you going to call it and so so it's just it's cool to see like this Evolution though even though you're actually quite good at pitching something uh like veter and I again buy into it what what's the name of this thing GNA be yeah the name is is cover c v r and what what's your philosophy on names I think names need I I I think people I I I have a certain philosophy towards it but I think um I really like names that are at the very basic level are really easy to say and spell and pronounce and I think most company names like violate one of those first three rules most names are just like too hard uh to spell and remember and pronounce in my mind um and yeah I really want um something that over time we can build like a real iconic brand in the space and that just takes a lot of time I would say there too but this The Branding around the name and the way you think about the you know the icon the f everything for me is like this like almost like when you build a house you like a really good foundation pour a lot of concrete it's that concrete it's that foundation and you do it in the early days hopefully you do it right um you know I've definitely done it wrong before we've done name changes before um and uh and you know these names are unique to my my perspective of how I want my businesses to look and feel at like whatever better Archer figure and cover but like I think um uh yeah we I we I just spend a decent amount of time thinking through that in the early days to build a good foundation for the brand are you adamant on a certain URL or domain name because cover.com is it looks like an insurance company I assume that's a huge insurance company I don't know uh but based off of the fact that they have that URL I imagine they're quite large do you care about the domain uh we own cover. and I own like obviously cover or sorry figure. and um I bought archer.the.gsd so it was like fly archer.the.gsd so um I would own the doom. AIS in these cases possible I know you don't care about money but when you are pitching to investors when you're thinking about how big covers going to be what's your pitch we're not pitching investors now I'm just funding it it's more like a passion project to be honest um the the pitches are going to be really unique because uh if we end up do raising Capital outside I I don't know there might be a path where we never raise Capital here um also path with technology is very it's very difficult so I mean hopefully we make it work um is the the biggest Market is not in schools schools is like the worst Market to go into it's just a bad pitch the schools have very low budgets they don't have systems like this exactly at the schools right now um you know like sure the severity hases with shootings but like the the money-making opportuni is like relatively small comparatively like stadiums and concerts and hospitals and areas that have big budgets like most big stadiums you go through now like go you go through like some metal detector and stuff uh TSA pre-check like the homeland security there's like there's real security applications for this outside of schools that could pay a lot more the schools is like the the worst pitch for fundraising uh for me uh I don't give a I really want to solve the K through2 School problem I wouldn't be doing this if I if it wasn't for that and we're going great great to schools to help solve like I I want to see if I can help prevent school shootings over time and that's what I that's that's the only reason I'm working on this like you know like funding this project I'm trying to work on it if I had to bet you're sort of like me where like you have a document where you just like jot down interesting ideas and you probably aren't going to get to them maybe you would if you had an additional 24 hours uh in your day some more time in your week uh what would you be spending it on what ideas interest you I I a few things I think there's um areas on like genetics I'm interested in a bit that I you know when I have time I'm doing a lot of research I think there's areas of like electric supersonic that are really interesting I'm really interested in superson Sonic's travel and I'm really interested in electric and there's areas of my experience at you know building eval aircraft that I'm like pretty excited about I have like a couple like ideas about how to design an aircraft that could like work through these very Divergent like um parts of the mission uh very like high altitudes and high speeds I I really like the industry of like synthetic Foods there's been a lot of like controversy recently is a synthetic meat is that like impossible or is that like the people who are like literally growing like a cow like the growing meat that you're you can eat it's not imposs those are all plant-based uh it's you're basically taking um uh these are like these are like cultured cells you're growing you're growing real Meats in a lab why does that interest you does that interest you and because you're an animal lover does it interest you because uh cows create a lot of pollution where's the interest come from it seems super unnecessary to like like raise animals and butcher them and eat them it just seems like super like for for many reasons like if you if you could choose to eat a steak and it was just as good as a as a steak you have today and it is real steak like real muscle muscle tissue and fats and it wasn't come from a cow and it came from a lab but it had all the same you know uh same chemical properties what what would you say well I think that I'm a little bit an early adopter on weird things and I would say that sounds awesome awesome I'm in you understand how that's weird for like your average person like dude do you remember when we were kids do you remember when green ketchup came out I remember eating green ketchup and I was like I know this is the exact same thing but for some reason because it looks different I don't even want to touch it yeah but like TV and radio and lights and electricity were those were all weird for folks at some point like those were all just like yeah it takes time cars were weird right like everybody's like why would you have a car when you have a horse like all of these are just like really radical in the moment like if we think about the civilization a thousand years from now we've been around for like thousands of years if you think 10,000 more years and we're on Mars and the moon you're going to be grow like having cows and bubbles on Mars and then butchering that like we're not have a room for that like it just seems unrealistic I don't think you understand how unique some of the things you think are and I like to think that because of where I'm from which oddly you are too but I don't if you like totally grasp that the way that you think is quite unique and a little bit larger than the average person and so yeah what you're saying makes sense but there's just a lot of emotional baggage that comes with that to overcome um but I do agree with you I think that that that interests you or that interests me as well and I would do it if you had to describe your yourself as an entrepreneur in one word uh what would you say you are what word uh best describes your philosophy I don't know I don't really reflect like that too often I I just I I just want to go build important things and win that's it what percentage of your philosophy is based on winning versus uh the excitement of making stuff all of it's winning I don't want to do something exciting in a lab that doesn't have the ability to have commercial applications and build a big business that has implications for the masses like that's just I'm not I'm not a research scientist like I I don't have passion for that um I like thinking about how we've evolved as species the last like even like several hundred years and how technology has like been probably the biggest lover arm for uh our Consciousness and understanding of the world and the only way to really do that is on a on a mass level like you know electricity in a lab that wasn't brought to all of civilization is marginally helpful uh marginally but the orders of magnitudes improvements we've had in humanity have come from like releasing that to the world as like an ubiquitous utility and for me winning is the most important thing here because you know let's call it like we we have a certain finite time to say I'm like to to do this kind of stuff as some point we'll be just too old or incapable of doing it and it's on to the next Generation so I think we have a certain amount of time to go win and go do things useful with our time because I think it's just devastating to spend like 20 30 years working on something that doesn't work that's like that's that's the worst case scenario for an entrepreneur as you're devoting all your time away from friends and family or whatever you could be spending time on as an opportunity cost into this business like if it doesn't win it's just like a terrible story yeah I think that when new when I talk to people who are just starting stuff that's often what I'll say is like the biggest issue is that you spend 10 years on this and it's just a mediocre thing it's better to to for it to suck right away I agreed I I actually do like a lot of these calls sometimes with like early entrepreneurs that are just getting going and I I'm like so intense about like the idea and the direction and the wise and they're just like yeah yeah I I like whatever how do we hire I get the first engineer in here I need to raise a safe note like how do I do that I just like dude like if I had a reverse time I would spend like a month on these questions and they like most early guys just don't want to don't want to hear it they want to get move in and get go build and I think you know we've talked about this a lot time I was on MFM like I kind of fell into vety and I kind of like I really built Archer and figure with a lot of purpose and intent it's the one thing I would pass down to like the the newer generation that's coming up building stuff like um like we have a choice on what to go build what's your criteria that you tell them is is your checklist for if something is worth my time like you you can't just get the one thing right like you just can't get the idea right or the commercial plan right or the fundraising like you're can easily fundrais this because it's a Hot Topic and get that right I think it's like really about you have to build this you know um I mean you call it a business plan or something but like you have to come up with like idea of like how you're actually going to get this thing done in in the face of like 95% of all companies that go try to do this and start plan failing and I would say it's not just about the idea and how you're going to execute it how you're going to balance like moving fast and for slower and product quality and what you're going to build as teer sets first or or later and who are going to be our first clients the Enterprise are the like smbs and how are you going to actually get distribution is it you know is it organically is it through social is it outbound or inbound sales like I think it's like putting that whole thing together and having a good clear direction of where the ship sailing is most important I have like a little chart I always draw people of like north south east and west like you want to go north you want to get this cone going north right you want to be heading this direction you're not going to be straight dead North but you want to be like not heading south for too long or you'll die and those are a factor of like all those kind of like you charistics I talked about earlier which is like just commercialization plan how you gonna make money how you gonna fund you g to fund the business whether it's like organically or you're going to raise capital and team you're going to bring on the culture you go build and the execution of the product like all those have to be like very thoughtful and driven in the right direction and you know we have this a figure right like we're going to BMW we're going to these industrial settings but we want to be in the home like we if we could be in the home today like home robots we would do that we are using the commercialization industrialization industry as a way to get us ready and more prepared for putting a robot in every home in the world which is a common way of going about it you know you think um I think Tesla did this where they started more expensive even though he was like you know I would like it to be the Model T where everyone could have one but I'm just going to start with highend because that will give us more profits to fund more stuff sure but why then then why has like Fisker failed twice in a row while Tesla's just been dominating what's the answer what's your what's your answer for that they they didn't get the product and some of the other stuff right same way Tesla did uh they didn't get speed right and the product quality and the the way they introduced in the world like all of that um wasn't balanced well enough uh and the companies out failed twice in a row you were on 60 Minutes the other day and on 60 Minutes I think you had like a plate and an apple and a banana like sitting in front of the robot and you said like uh hey uh hand me the apple or hand me the orange or something like that and it did a good job where it like it reached and it found the right fruit and I think it made a mistake once or twice but then it like corrected itself and you're like hey that's that's the wrong one and it was like oh I'm sorry and it like picked up the right one what's crazy to me is that you're two years old the company's two years old I've seen that you've been able to do this so quickly and I think uh when I talk to someone they go everything's late with tech and and and in Hardware but somehow Brett hasn't been late figer has been lightning fast what have you guys done to be so fast so when I started figure in in also Archer I did this at Archer too I I started the company before it was even Incorporated with this idea of like how to move extremely fast so like listen it's like it's like a whole company was built Just For Speed we have our company mission statement which like we want to go this direction as a company then everything else as we like built out the or chart and thought about how we're going to do that the the values that we think about hiring people for firing people for how we think about compensation how we think about uh how do we build schedules how do we plan for schedules like we we don't have we're 120 Engineers here we have zero program managers zero and we have a certain philosophy around like what to do and and how to build hardware and software that I think we're kind of the anti-s Silicon Valley company in Silicon Valley as it relates to this um we really care about getting things brought up quicker and iterating faster been doing that over a very long period of time like decades and building a company that can do that is extremely hard like there's really no good precedent maybe outside of like Tesla and SpaceX that have done this well at scale like Tesla has you know well over 100,000 people like largly tens of thousands of you know product design engineers and they're moving at a speeds of a small startup and generally when you're adding head Cal the companies are all slowing down it's it's almost every company slowing down with more headcount you're just getting slower over time uh you don't notice it you don't care the board is is like giving you indication that you should slow down and be safer and everything's just slowing to a halt and the limit so you have to basically fight this and you have to like the best way you can fight it is like design the whole word from the ground up to to do this or do what Elon did with Twitter and walk in and fire 80% of people and restructure it at the start uh that point in time to to go faster and ship product and it's too laborious here to say like okay we move fast like what one thing it's like it's the whole company was built just to move fast but what are you asking your recruits the your potential or your applicant your job applicants to figure out if they do have that ability there's a lot of things uh happening here a lot of times people haven't been in that environment so when they get in there when they moveing a fast and a much um quicker paced environment uh it just becomes overwhelming and just too hard too stressful to handle so if you were like a PhD student for 10 years wearing you know sweatpants and like moving slow and you come in here it's like a real culture shock coming to the figure and we've had it happen several times where they're like people are just like you know they're coming in late they're moving slow and just like it just it's frustrating for them having to move much faster and it's like um probably a lot of anxiety there um there are other folks that believe the longer that you take to build something the safer it is and the better job you'll do at it so if you give me you know two years design a robot it will be that robot will be safer at the end of the two years um and better designed like folks feel like that it's for sure wrong people think that the longer you spend designing something the safer it'll be and the better it'll be it's for sure wrong because in that two-year period of time where that one robot got out I'm gonna have my third gen robot out and I'll have I'll have run it like an order of magnitude longer I will have found all the problems 10 times sooner I will have had times to go fix it recursively and make it better it'll it'll just be a worse product how do you measure and how how do other people measure if someone's fast enough uh you look at how many iterations somebody is doing and how much progress they made between those iteration cycles and what is what you what are your expectations a car could be like how many car versions you've gotten out over the last decade and how much progress you've made between those uh a rocket could be similar view a robot could be how many robot iterations are we doing um what version of robot are we on iPhone could be you know what how many versions of iPhone have you got now last 15 years how much progress you made between each one of those that will ultimately set the slope of the curve for Speed that that will ultimately be correlated at a high level to how much risk there is of failure in the business long term uh as we wrap up here I want to I want to ask something that I've been thinking about with you a lot so you've mentioned uh some type of genetically engineered food you've mentioned uh planes you've mentioned uh fig humanoids uh these machines that detect guns you have like a pretty wide range of knowledge but unlike a lot of people who have a wide range of knowledge you I've been to your home I've seen like textbooks at your house on a variety of topics and and you have a really unique way of learning you're you're basically like a human AI do you have a framework for learning new things learning stuff is always like really challenging for me I think like I have to first I think everything like a tree I have to first build this like trunk of like first order understanding about the topic before I can ever um comprehend and remember the limbs and the leaves and so I have to have like a really fundamentally sound understanding of the tree trunk as I look at certain topics where do you turn to for that you just got to like you know find this stuff whether it's Wikipedia papers uh like Google searches uh use gp4 like can you clearly communicate this topic whether it's an engineering topic or or not to a 12-year-old sitting on a bar stool and most people can't do that it's like the skill that most people can't do like even people I work with I have a hard time sometimes understanding what's the update on the on the on the you know this this thing or that thing and it's a skill like you have to learn how to do that same way of like understanding something it's a skill to really boil things out and really truly understand the basic characterization of what's really happening some of the smartest people I know are also the most clear worded folks about uh about a topic that's a really good insight and it probably comes because you're an outsider that got into this stuff when you're older um maybe or there's so many different multi-disciplinary areas of like software and hardware and like electromagnetics and everything else that needs to be done here that you really need to be able to communicate clearly across several groups and it's even here like we try not to use acronyms and a software purpose person that writes firmware an electromagnetics person that builds like a rotor stator for electric motor like those those folks don't understand those other disciplines generally so they need to communicate with each other as well and they can't be using inside baseball terms on L manetic work um when like a firm engineer hasn't spent any time like you know ster and rotor design for electric rotors so like I think this topic of being able to like communicate really well and understand things really well it's just like super important you have like a pretty strong outlook on life it seems like you you you have uh strong beliefs on um what you want the outcome of your life to be how you want to spend your time which uh people who you've read about has had the biggest influence on that uh philosophy or influenced you the most I think there's like there's been like really great entrepreneurs over time to show a path that this all can be done like Steve Jobs Elon Musk these guys are the best of what they do have been able to show the world like really incredible things can be done on the back of like persistence and focus and I think it's just like really incredible like every time I watch Like a SpaceX launch or hold an Apple product in my hands I mean you know every company in the world started out as a startup at some point so I think it's just um I don't know I think it's very energizing to think that you know somebody with with enough willpower can actually go out and do really incredible things for the world and I think that gives me energy every day I wake up and says you know even I hear a figure we have like we haven't done really anything noteworthy today over two years it's been interesting we have robots and stuff but people have built robots we need to go out now and like prove that we can actually ship really high quality product which is going to take us you know several more years from here but like that's just like a really exciting challenge for us now and it's really hard and everybody that's attempted that at least in human robotics commercially has failed in history so but that should be doable and there are people that have gone over this hump in other industries of other very difficult things uh maybe less difficult or more difficult here in history and that's just that should be very energizing for for us here at figure and other entrepreneurs out there trying to do hard things I have this joke I'm like uh cornrows are cool but not for me and uh that's kind of how I feel about uh the way you think where I'm like I don't know if I can do what you do but but I am really excited and happy that people like you exist uh so thank you for doing everything you're doing uh I feel great after talking to you yeah thanks for having me on all right that's the pod [Music]

if you have a side hustle you need to find a different main hustle you're better off with the time you spent on a side hustle investing that incremental effort in your main hustle a side hustle is fine if you're investigating a new main Hustle but the way you get wealthy is not a variety of things it's being really great at one thing so that's the focus and the term we used is is Mastery or ninja like capability but try and find something you could become great at in an industry that's not very sexy CU if you're in the top 10% of tax law or of installing energy efficient HVAC or you're in the top 10% of people who know to how to install soap stone kitchen counters you're going to make a really good living and I think young people mistake passion for their Hobbies not recognizing when they get older to be able to give money away to be able to do nice things to be able to relax with your partner it's just super enjoyable and the way you get there is by making more than you spend but the first thing you got to do is find a focus

all right my friends today's episode it's special for me and it's going to be special for anyone out there who's a Creator or who owns a media company let me explain so I've got this friend named Craig Fuller Craig fer runs this company called Freight waves it's a data business but they have a media arm and it's a huge company they've raised tens of millions in uh funding and they make tens of millions in recurring Revenue huge business however on the side he ended up buying a bunch of magazines including flying magazines a bunch of boating magazines very weird of him to do that and I wanted to do a podcast about that turns out he's bought all of these Niche magazines for a very small amount of money and he's only about three years into business and the company's doing around 60 million in revenue and 12 million in profit and it's his prediction that by 2030 he's going to do a billion in Revenue which is a insane that that's someone's side project that they're doing that and B I wanted to learn all about it I wanted to learn about the model that he's doing where he's basically Buy these magazines and then he's selling the audience different productes products and services including like building an airplane hanger and spell and selling space in that hanger for flying magazine things like that so if you have an audience if you want to build an audience if you want to build a big business on top of that audience this podcast is for you all right check it [Music] out well we're live this is is just how we we just get right into it love it it's not often that someone's side hobby becomes almost cooler than their main thing particularly given that your main thing is this like massive hit so your Craig Fuller you've got this thing called Freight waves which is a data business but you guys also have a popular media arm and you just you display most of your financials online as if you're a publicly traded company almost and I don't know what the revenue is but it's somewhere in the high tens of millions uh in recurring revenue and then you also have uh you've raised what $90 million for that 65 in Venture Capital but we raised some debt on top of it so total about a little bit under 80 million or a little bit over 80 million and then your your latest kind of side project that is not really the size of most people's side project is fir Crow media where you've bought dozens of magazines and you've parlayed that into like you've turned flying magazine into like a country club but for flying enthusiasts and so you've like bought you know thousands of Acres of land you've built an airport and now you've you're buying even more pieces of property more stuff and I think what fir Crown does what 50 million this year in Revenue 60 million run rate so um is where we'll finish this year so golly man and what I didn't realize I was doing research I didn't realize that Trucking kind of runs through your family right yeah my father started what's now or he sold the business last year but it became the fifth largest trucking company in the US and my uncle started the eighth largest what's now how the eth Florida tracking up in us were your uncle and father competitors oh yeah yeah they're pretty pretty Die Hard competitors but are they tight are they are they good family members nowadays they're much better you know they do get along now but there was a period of time where they just absolutely hated each other my family is in the Pro my father's a produce broker so I grew up with truckers and it's an interesting industry because the people who own the businesses can be pretty wealthy but they're still rednecks like they're still like blue they're like Blue Collar guys but they're not necessarily always traditionally educated and they're still rough even if they're quite wealthy was your dad like uh like a bluecollar guy even though that he ran this huge company yeah I mean he's a bluecollar guy I mean he you know he look presentable in a suit and he's talking to Wall Street investors I mean he certainly is you know he's presentable he's not getting to embarrass himself in front of folks but he he is you know he's he's a finance guy I mean ultimately in trucking you're operating a business that operates with single digigit margins you know 1 to 3% margins and so uh you've got to know how to operate that business it's an owner operator type business and so he certainly is an operator and he eventually I think recently sold that business for like $800 million do right yeah he merged it into night Swift which is the largest it was the second largest Trucking merger in history uh the company did about2 and a half billion dollars when it sold for $ 800 million and you were working for him and I read that you worked for him starting at a young age you kicked ass but for some reason you buted heads with the executive team you got fired I think in your late 20s or early 30s and you started shockingly which I can't believe you did this day trading and you were like I gotta build something and so at 36 I think or 34 you were like I want to do almost like day trading but for freight stuff is that right yeah I mean I got fired twice so I got fired from my father's Trucking Company US Express in 2005 it was actually my older brother mother who became the CEO of us express that had had to be fired in 2005 and my dude your family's a bunch of assel man pretty much but um we I love them but they're this is this is a family tradition you fire and you go out and start your own business and then they had a payments company a fuel card company that they had incubated that I took over and uh scaled up and then we sold part of that to US bank and we were doing both fleet card processing and debit card processing Payment Processing for banks what what's a what's a fuel card I know that truckers have them but I don't entirely know what they do or how they make money when truckers want to buy fuel you figure 200 gallons if they're truly topping off their tank uh is they're going to fill up with you know a, to 1,200 to $1,400 wow okay and what they use some card and do they get perks or something what's the business no they it's for fraud management because what will happen is if you don't man I mean think about it you've got you know uspress had 9,000 truck drivers um and you're giving them all an expense account that effectively they they're buying fuel but they're also doing over the road maintenance so if they need tires or they need truck breaks down you know those things could be 10 $20,000 on a breakdown situation or could be you know thousands of dollars in tires um or fuel and so you know a truck driver is responsible for probably six to 8,000 of expenses per month when you look at total what the total cost of an expense is and so you have a lot of fraud that ends up happening and so Fleet cards are there to manage the fraud both on the fuel spend but also on the um on the you know all the maintenance and stuff got it I never knew what those did all right cool um so you're you're growing this thing whatever it's working out fine and then you get into Freight waves uh Freight alley that that works out good uh how long did it take to to kind of get into the tens of millions in Revenue it's about $20 million business by in two years three years something like that how did it grow so fast the formula right like timing was great this was when a lot of venture capital investment made into the space um and then you also had this digitization that was taking place where companies were trying to digitize the supply chain and then you know at the end of the day I had relationships it's funny because my dad didn't put any money in the company he told me I'd be a bad CEO and refused to invest in the business and so I had to go raise Venture Capital dude are you and your are you and your family close oh yeah my dad and I talk he's now like after he sold US Express he's now one of my largest investors in fire Crown he actually is my largest investor in fire Crown so we're actually really tight I've been following you for a while and when I think of like a a a good media CEO you are one of the the people that I think of uh what attributes did you have that made him think that you would be a bad CEO yeah well I had ran a business a payments business they fired me in 2014 uh because it was a tech business and tech technology businesses while they generate a lot of margin they scale they actually burn a lot of capital but you know trucking's a cash flow business he didn't understand that you know a tech business as it would scale would actually consume Capital so he got really mad and he would didn't want to raise any money so he fired me because he didn't think I could run a a business that would be profitable because that's not how technology companies typically work in their early phases what's funny about that business is is that's one of the most valuable assets family's portfolio now um it just got a $500 million valuation last you know sold some stock and September of last year so uh it's done well uh but I you know I've been out of that business for many years all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talk about copyrighting and how it's changed our lives constantly on this podcast and we give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resource that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show all right so this is the main thing that I wanted to talk about so there's this um blog that I love it's called um Flash and Flames I'm pretty sure that like only maybe 10,000 people a month read Flash and Flames so if you're listening to this and you're a fan of like media businesses this is my favorite blog on the internet it's written by this guy named Colin Morrison he's based in England he wrote this article that I think it was called uh why magazines are the new trophy asset or something like that and I read that you saw that article and you're like I'm going to go out and buy magazines is that right yeah I mean I was reading it and I was you know it was essentially the trophy asset and he was using the example of Martin Bia buy Time Magazine and some others and it was really interesting because I was like you know I could by Time Magazine you know the two media businesses that I would own that would be trophy assets far beyond it would be like Bloomberg would be number one and you know owning owning something the CNBC scale would also be another obviously those are way outside my league so they're not happening and I was thinking to myself I had just taken up Aviation taken up flying and I was reading flying magazine and I was pretty uninspired and so I was like it would be cool to own like a an aviation magazine to own flying magazine because that would be my trophy I'm a pilot and that's sort of what I I would like to do and so it inspired me to reach out to the owners of flying magazine and asked if they would sell the magazine and they said it's not for sale but we're happy to talk to you and uh I made an offer and they ended up selling it to me and that sort of it was started off same it started off as a side hustle I didn't actually intend I thought print magazines were dead and dinosaurs read print magazines and I became very skeptical of the whole print magazine business model but when I bought it I fell in love with the not just the content and what you could do with it but also the value what print brings to an audience and so what I found is that really these print magazines are completely undervalued uh that nobody will touch them because they view had the same philosophy that I had about them dying yet they own these fantastically great communities and audiences that have been around for decades and and particularly as you get into sort of the older populations grew up with magazines is they still have these really important um sort of connections to the brands and we you found that's a really interesting opportunity were you liquid when you decided to buy it or were you like I if they if the price that they want is in the millions I'm gonna have to go get money from someone else no I had enough money to pull that off so with your money do you keep a large percent in like the s&p500 and this was just a fraction of it or was this like a meaningful amount it was just I mean it was a meaningful amount relative to my liquidity I mean in terms of my total n worth not significant but I have a lot of paper worth as I Piner back Bounder tends to be um but you don't have a lot of liquidity so relative to liquidity yeah it was a big it was a big number then what was the thinking is I'm GNA have to buy this and I'm GNA have to spend some hours per week to making sure that it doesn't lose money well it was profitable I mean it was generated about half a million dollars of Eid year as a standal on entity about two and a half million in Revenue so it was a small this is a small business and we buy businesses at three to five times EA does typically the number these things trade at so we're not talking about a huge like this wasn't a huge Capital outlay so like 1.5 to $2.5 million is what it it was about you know total purchase price is about three and a half million when you look at cash and and some deferred expenses and deferred payments so it came at to about $ three and half million doar uh which you know seven times five you know two and a half million up front and a million deferred and uh yeah but then you got to deal with like to journalists a lot of times I hire journalists they're [ __ ] pains in the asses and like when I think of like all my potential side Hobbies I'm like I'd rather be a beekeeper than like own a freaking magazine and deal with these employees or I'd rather get to like going for walks or hikes I don't know about this well look I I mean I had you know freightways as 40 or if you look at total contributors that are Journal could qualifies as journalist or contributors have 40 to 50 so I I knew what the you know I knew what the rodeo was going to look like for running you know having teams of journalists work for you what was different though with magazines is these are different than sort of younger sort of uh digital native journalist or or journalists that have been sort of working in newsrooms is magazine journalists don't do it because they make a lot of money they do it because they love the content and and they're also there's a sense of defeatism that has existed across all Publishers and I've seen this in the multitude of back we've done is where the editorial teams feel like the the the owners of the magazines don't love them and aren't willing to make investments in them and they almost look at you and I hate to use this term uh is almost liberators of their business because in some ways they they love the content they love the subject matter they have the relationships they tend to be sort of micro celebrities in their own community so the so these are the old school influencers if you will and yet they get no love from corporates because what's happened is the whole magazine business model collapsed in the last 10 years because the way that magazines made money in the past the internet has destroyed that business model and rather than sort of digitizing their business model or sort of evolving their business model they just started to cut cost and so that was the way they sort of fend off the inevitable and the problem is at some point the value that the community gets and the audience gets is diminished and these things are just it's a it's sort of a death Circle and so what we do is we we come in we buy them in some ways we liberate them from this sort of De inevitable Decline and they feel really encouraged by that you know we we upgrade the paper we upgrade the quality we make investments in the editorial team you know flying's editorial team went from s of three folks when we bought it to 30 so you have three primary full-time employees and then you have contributors that are submitting an article that goes in the magazine very different from the world you and I sort of come from digital media where you actually have a full-time staff that's writing content on a daily basis they're writing they're contributing a piece that's once a month and so it may be an airline pilot or a flight instructor or someone who really knows the jet Market or the turban market and so you want subject matter expertise and typically writing is a second is is not their primary job they do it as a sort of a side hustle to make a little bit of money uh and that's why these businesses have operated but what they've what they've also done is they've they've not made investments in like front quality or online assets or any of that stuff how much revenue did you do do in the first year of owning it revenue and profit uh in 2022 I think we were about $7 million in Revenue six and a half 7 million something like that oh so you like aggressively grew it yeah how um because we invested in so a couple things we did was we invested in the magazine we raised the price uh the magazine was losing $7 so the magazine was taken in 8 per subscription but it cost them $15 a month it cost $8 a year was the net revenue I know you you look for folks that are listening that your face is exactly what mine was they were generating on average $ in Revenue per subscriber per year and it cost them $15 to fill that subscriber they were losing and have since as far back as our data went since 2006 losing $7 per subscriber and I said so fly magazine costs $8 a year to subscribe on average the average yield the average across the whole subscriber base the magazine generated $8 on average per subscriber and when you say yield that's not uh uh Revenue minus the hard cost that is that is the revenue that's the Topline number oh that's stupid that you got they were losing Sam they were losing $7 per magazine or per subscriber per year yeah so like a flying magazine subscriber is definitely going to pay $50 a year or whatever or you would think right that was my reaction to it is essentially our Communications to the staff were to the sales team was basically you're going to raise the rates of advertising sales because we want to go to people who who so on the ad sales we raise the cost of ads but we also just subscribers basically said look if somebody's not willing to spend $3 or $40 a year then they're not really they don't care about the content I mean think about this to buy an airplane you're going to spend you know minimum 50,000 that's a you know old aircraft to buy a most of the folks are buying you know quarter of a million to a million dollar aircraft and and some of our audience is 75 to hundred million dollar airplanes and so you have a you have a a natural audience that is going to spend a lot of money because they care about the hobby or they care about their careers or whatever it is they're if they're not willing to spend 30 or $40 they're also not going to buy advertised because what happened is in the old days and how many subscribers so we when we bought that it was about 108,000 subscribers that's pretty great um we actually when we raised the price we raised it to 30 initially it actually went down to 32,000 subscribers no [ __ ] we bled it out but that's okay like we wanted to do that we wanted to get rid of and there was a lot of what we call freeloaders they were essentially targeted for advertising purposes uh or they're the people like you may remember this I when you were younger is your would like your school would have a fundraiser and you would bring home a form and your parents would sign like buy a magazine they didn't care about there was a lot of subscriptions like that where the people that were actually subscribing didn't care about the content and I basically said I don't want any of them I want people actually care with the content and we were very successful in doing that and and so we saw uh subscriptions grow substantially in terms of actual full paid subscriptions and subscription dollars we were basically doubled the subscription Revenue over the course of a year yet still had like a third of the subscribers we've been down to 32,000 we're now about 45,000 we've grown it since and are you able to manage this growth off the cash flows of the business or did you have to put more capital in I put more Capital uh that I I wanted to put more capital in like I could have ran it tighter but I didn't want to how much did you put in you know look I we total invested about $40 million in the business but that's not flying that's that's all the Acquisitions we've done and everything we've acquired at this point in the store you've not raised outside Capital no no I didn't really I actually had a I had half a million dollars in from Two Brothers of early investors in Freight Wes that bought in they got 15% of the business for $500,000 so you grow it to 7.5 in and how much profit um business was about Break Even at 7.5 million because we were not we were not optimizing for profitability we were optimizing for growth who' you hire to run it so I was I was doing a lot more day-to-day and I I recruited a team to come in uh to to run the day-to-day operations okay so uh we're at the end of 22 and I think around this time you actually were like holy [ __ ] uh I might have just like hit on something interesting I should go out and buy more and do this again or did you first come up with the crazy idea to buy all that land so I bought the land in 2021 about 1,500 Acres so originally I didn't plan on being a real estate what we actually wanted to do was uh go out and build a media center connected to a Runway because you know if people are going to fly in airplanes remember at the end of the day the content for flying is all about the airplane like people care less about the pilot they care a lot about the airplane and this is no different than a car magazine where you're going to look at the lambo or the Ferrari for the avation audience they want to see the newest aircraft being produced and so we wanted to create a video Center to connect it to an airport the problem was that none of the airports in the community five Regional Community airports around chattanoga were willing to sort of do anything they said you know basically you have to go from the state the municipality the state and the FAA have to approve it in order to get to build a media center when you say Media Center you mean yeah to take video we wanted to have a hanger that had a basically a video studio and photography studio that we can bring airplanes in but you have to build that uh because it wasn't there's no hanger there's a national hanger shage across the country um and and because what happens is nobody wants to municipalities who own all these airports don't want investment in private hangers uh for small aircraft they they want the big airplanes and there's just a problem of allocation so we decided to go build our own headquarters and I was looking for land looking for about 50 acres and I came across this piece of land had 1500 acres and um it was priced at 3.65 million and uh I I drove up there and it reminded me of this Resort in East Tennessee called Blackberry Farm yeah my wife absolutely loves it's sort of back to farming agricultural so I show up there and I'm like this looks and feels a lot like Blackberry Farm and that was sort of the original inspiration is we wanted to create a Flyin Community with a Runway and home sites that are connected to the runway that had that Blackberry Farm inspired sort of experience how much did you pay for that 3.6 mil did you pay it or did you raise money no I borrow it from the bank I mean real estate is one of those things you can go borrow money um and so remember I'm I have a a relatively High net worth I don't have no liquidity this is why I'm asking these questions because your net worth is significantly higher than mine because um you your business is bigger than mine but I'm liquid and even me I'm like scared to make some of these bets you don't seem to have that same fear you seem to be way more offensive and you seem way more I mean look it's not like we're inventing like electric cars or going to Mars and so I don't want to like Grande it make it too Grand but like you're out laying a lot of cash on some really crazy ideas you're like I'm gonna build an I'm gonna buy an old magazine and I'm gonna spend more of my money and build an aviation Community like that's like really weird uh and that's really ballsy why what do you think you have what's that Gene inside of you that makes you think these wacky things are going to work because it data like my experience suggests that it will but you know it's taking more shots on goal like yeah I got three and a half million doar in an investment for a real estate project but if it goes to zero I still own three and half million of land right the end of the day yeah but that's a huge project to get into because did do you know anything about real estate no but you can you can bring in teams to go run those things um which we have so like Sam it's a matter of scaling businesses and and hiring teams to run these things yeah it's risk but yeah I agree with you this is just this is just outside your your expertise and you've made it your expertise very quickly yeah I mean but but media was outside my expertise uh running a Data Business was outside my expertise but real estate is actually frankly I wouldn't say it's easier it's a it's a it's a different Playbook that frankly can be learned it's not as if you know building a SAS business and building a Data Business there's a very small number of sort of models to follow there's a very few companies that you can sort of model your business I think the risk is lower for that though the risk is lower for software I disagree I think real estate real estate is uh so much less riskier because you actually find out assets at the end of the day that's true the difference though is when I I can start a software I can start an Internet or data company with significantly less money than cost to purchase a meaningful piece of property but I own the land remember that land at5500 Acres at $2,400 an acre has value you can sell that land for something else you can partition it out um you know if you looked at that at what an acre would go for in that Community 50 to 60,000 if it was subdivided just wasn't and so we knew the land had some underlying value but we didn't know if there would be any demand for Pilots uh we advertised it was in January 2022 we actually took out ads in our own magazine to test the market what did you say in the ad you know it was written as if it was written to my wife effectively like my wife was the target audience which is your Blackberry Farm audience and we wrote a story about we're building a resort and we didn't focus on the aviation which is really what you would expect us to focus on WE focused on the amenities around the experience that we were going to build we shap we Vision shaped it and we didn't expect to get a lot of response we had over 300 in B inquiries on that one ad we took out in our own magazine and uh we were able to get people to sign contracts to basically uh Reserve their spot and we knew then we had a winner did you like make a joke about the fact that you're new to this or or were you like more professional but you're like I mean I didn't make a joke about new but we I mean like we were very transparent about the fact this was a a j not a joke but being light-hearted you're like who knows what's gonna happen I mean UL it's about like we recruit recruited people that actually had experience in doing you know the development the master planning Community there are groups that actually take on a lot of the burden to do the work that you need to build these things it's not as if I'm having to 1500 acres is a huge project you're not going to do that yourself you're You're Gonna Want teams to deal with zoning issues environmental issues engineering issues that we brought in air airport planning to uh uh Consultants we brought in um uh development consultants and so it's not as if I'm doing all this work myself I have a whole team you ask who's running these projects I have a team that's running them uh that's managing all the different pieces of it and they and people wrote in and they basically said if you're able to build this count me in for buying a $800,000 home on that property something no that's that's the the lots are 600,000 so the homes are probably 2 million to $3 million and did they sign and they what did they what did they give to you that the bank took as uh they signed a contract and they let they put a deposit so $40,000 an acre on a $600,000 purchase price but they put $40,000 in per acre 20,000 per lot and did was it like you basically quote pre-sold was it like $15 million worth of these properties Yeah we actually got up to about $28 million uh in total bookings um yeah total reservation deposits but we thought we were going to get through this process uh for Environmental approval quicker zoning approval we actually thought we'd break ground by the end of 22 so we had some churn out we've refunded their money because these are refundable deposits it's not as if they're giving you money that you get to hold on to it's no different than if you bought you put a deposit on an airplane or put a deposit on a car uh these are fully refundable uh but we're about $15 million in in total reservations right now so this project alone is awesome but then it gets even crazier and like I this is just fascinated by you because I view you a little bit as a peer and that we're both like media nerds but the way that we're different is that you're you're doing great with risk like you you're you're going you're taking more risk I think uh but it doesn't it's all working out and this is where it gets interesting is you're like all right this thing worked for flying magazines what flying magazine what happens if I go out and get more of these titles and do this whole content to Commerce thing and did you raise money for that uh not initially uh so I have not raised any my father invested when he sold his trucking business last year so he's my only outside investor other than the initial round everything was done by myself and I was just using Bank debt uh frankly borrowing money from Banks and liquidating my portfolio because I felt like I would rather invest in myself than invest in the S&P I think the difference between Sam isn't necessarily that I'm like I am willing to take more risk I'm also willing to take more shots on goal I just think fundamentally like an asymmetric mindset that I have is is I may lose let's say the real estate project went to zero I'm gonna lose three and a half million dollar that sucks but you know what I had been my dad cut me off my dad fired me in 2014 I had basically like no job nothing like it was I was for all intents of purposes on my own at right bottom I had to figure out I've done that before and so I'm not afraid of losing it all and I know that I can get it back and so we've applied that rule to everything that we've done and we make Acquisitions under the philosophy that it's asymmetric risk is like let's say that we buy a business or buy a magazine that's we spend half a million dollars or a million dollars and let's say it goes to zero let's say that we're completely wrong about our thesis and the thing is just a dog well then we write off that half a million or million dollar investment but if we're right and we get a three or five or 10x multiple on that business that creates an enormous amount of value for us and so that's how we've approached our Acquisitions um and I'm willing to take Bank debt because Bank debt is frankly pretty cheap by the way I think about money differently than you and I think it's cool to hear your perspective because I think I should do it more but the way that I think about it with privately as a entrepreneur of private companies I think if most of my money if most of my net worth is ill liquid any liquidity that I get whether it's annual cash flows or it's from selling I I sold one of my companies I take all that money and I stock it away in like a safe thing where it's like uh if all else goes to [ __ ] from whatever I have that is enough forever and so that's how I view it so like whatever how much money I have I I stick it away and I'm like that doesn't exist basically and I'm going to go and use a very much smaller sum to go start more companies and I'll try to live off of my income from those companies and if they sell great if they don't hey I still have this other thing that I have what you're doing is different than me and I like what you're doing because I think it's Bolder and I think it's probably a bit more fun if it works which is you're like even though I've got this private this other private company that it's doing quite well so it's not going to go out to nothing but I have some liquidity I'm GNA pile that liquidity into more interesting but potentially risky things well I like freightways at some point will sell like it will show will do be an exit that to me is the nest egg like for for my long term like I know it's going to sell who knows what it sells for but there is Val fundamental tangible value in the business so for me and it's big enough that it's slightly D very DK yeah I mean it's it's totally drisk and and there's a lot of value in that business and I have a salary it's not as if I I'm not like the board takes care of me and I so for me I have that asset everything else is that will set my family up for gener you know for at least a generation like my kids will be able to go to college be able to buy a house and so forth so I'm not worried about like my ability to survive if everything else falls down but I do think diversifying my risk through all these other projects actually enhances my long-term returns uh particularly if I'm using my balance sheet to borrow money from the bank at frankly relatively low cost what about diversifying your time that's probably that what well that's what teams do for you right right like you hire people to run it like you know Preston Holland who I I think you know um we brought Preston in to initially run flying he's now running a finance business that we've got uh that is doing aircraft financing uh we brought in a team to run we have Reese that's running our real estate project so again and I fired myself from almost every functional role I had at Freight waves is I like God are you are you chairman or CEO of fre I'm CEO but I the day-to-day day-to-day functions inside that business I have uh Spencer Pand who's my C CFO and coo is running most of the day-to-day most of the day-to-day decisions are going through him I'm working through strategy and thinking about the long-term prognosis business so I can run and do deals and look at additional ways to lever this business up without getting caught up in the individual sort of minutia of running a business so how many uh titles has fire Crown acquired at this point we're about 54 I think is the number did you buy them in batches like you bought do you typically I mean Publishers in the magazine business it's hard to get scale with one title just because there's a finite audience that will care about that content and so typically a publisher and here's the thing about magazines is that only 25% of the content 205% of the operations of that business actually is value added to a customer you have audience development you have magazine uh production you have layout like a customer doesn't experience that they only about 25% of the cost structure is the editorial product or the photography so you you need a lot of infrastructure to run a successful magazine or frankly media business operation I think you know the media side magazine it was insane basically the hustle we could have I mean we were at about 2 million subscribers when I sold now I don't know what it's at let's say three or three and a half basically three people on editor if we were selling ads so when I ran the company three people on editorial and 37 people selling ads and managing ads and making it grow yeah and that's three people bring all the value it's crazy right it's I mean it's just how these media businesses work is you have a couple people that are up front and the rest of it is infrastructure and so what you typically see when we buy a magazine is we're having we're buying a portfolio we're buying not just one title but three or four titles that come along with it and so we've done a you know maybe maybe two maybe 20 different Acquisitions that have made up that portfolio but some of them have been really big we bought Bomier which is like the they're the largest publisher in Sweden the sort of the rert Murdoch family of Sweden and they owned a bunch of voting titles which we bought uh last been last fall and really we own boating yachting selling world uh fish saltwater Sportsman and so really this large Marine title and Aviation we bought a number of Aviation titles uh through various portfolios and then we just recently bought model trains a bunch of railroad titles and astronomy titles so bringing that all together that puts us the whole portfolio just whatever 12-year-old Craig is into boats planes RC trades so it's almost like my five-year-old's like dream I me think about this boats it's airplanes it's trains and it's space it's pretty cool for you know like a 5-year-old boy it's pretty magical you know but what we're buying are these audiences that love the content they're they're Enthusiast and effectively by owning the the magazine which we Finance through the the p&l of the magazine itself subscriptions and advertisings we make money in media but we're ultimately buying the audience itself to sit to offer some other product or service to them yeah so let's walk through this Playbook so the Playbook is to acquire customers profitably and you do that by having a media arm that its own business or having a media company that's is its own business and make a profit via subscriptions and advertising step two is to make sure the audience I imagine you'll have to correct me it's you're you're doing something in your head of like will they spend a lot of money on something is that right yeah essentially but if they're if they're Enthusiast if if a category is big and they're enthusiastic about the category then the answer is pretty much yes I mean if they the thing remember about magazines and particularly magazines that are decade old magazines is these things have survived potentially the great we know magazines that are over 100 years old they've survived multiple Wars they've survived multiple pandemics they've survived uh the Great Depression like the audience truly cares about the content enough to subscribe and if they've if these magazines have survived the internet age in multiple phases of it they're going to be around for many many years and so essentially we're buying it because they they care deeply about the content and then ultimately they can buy another product or service and then is step three like raise prices and sell ads better or like do you think about that well I don't think we look at it in the same step right so like we do we treat these we have a we have a media business which runs the media operation and then as we go find Commerce so let's say aircraft Finance we find essentially an executive a CEO if you will that can run that business through its own pnl that's separate than the media business but in order to finance that you like these people wouldn't be selling you these businesses if they were kicking ass but you're been able you've been able to make them kick ass a lot better and so you must be doing something just on the media side that they didn't do what are those things yeah I mean effectively you're fixing a lot of their cost structure and looking at it and in terms of the spend opportunity of that audience and create data that can you know really uh look at data from the perspective of intent for someone that wants to buy a product so if you're if you're reading flying magazine you're either a pilot an aspiring pilot or an aircraft owner or somebody who wants to own an airplane there that's the four Prim I mean there's people who read flying because they like airplanes but it's a small piece of the audience and so we know each of those categories are going to spend some money in each of their outcome so a student pilot is going to take flying lessons is going to cost him $10,000 if he's going to be a career pilot he's going to make $15 million over the course of his career a lot of opportunity to to help him uh along his journey uh if they're an aircraft buyer prospective buyer they're going to buy an airplane they're also going to buy insurance Finance out of that they're also going to have a lot of expenses to own that aircraft throughout their life and so these are the journeys that we we have and that's ultimately what we're doing is we're optimizing the the magazine the advertisers based on intent not based on the fact fact that this is a number and what we've explained to the owners the advertisers is wouldn't you rather reach the hundred people that're going to buy them buy your airplane versus the 100,000 people that you know 99% of those people are never going to buy any of your products that's what we need to do is actually get into that intent data and we do that through digital like print is just one aspect of what we do but is driving intent data to actually be able to demonstrate to them there's a value to that customer that was a very good pitch and then uh you when you hire these guys to create so uh I guess airplane financing means you help people get loans to to buy a plane and then I think you have like a classified section so people selling uh planes and then now you have the real estate one I don't know what you've done with the other titles how you've done the same content to Commerce type of play but I want to hear more about what those are but when you're hiring people to build these businesses on top of an audience do you hire how much do you decide to invest in them until invest in their their new the new business until they're able to make a profit you know we we have a we're pretty patient I mean it depends on the business itself U if it's growing and it's in its kpis then we'll continue support it you know every business is different obviously the real estate business has you know we haven't Broken Ground yet so that that is going to take many years to sort of generate a profit it has its own sort of Journey the finance business is a finance brokerage business and it should generate profitability much quicker than some of the other projects you know we buy e-commerce businesses we we've now own six e-commerce businesses what are you selling we own the largest NASA or the largest space merch store on the internet called the space store uh so it's like Collectibles the aviation nerds and the space nerds are the VIN diagram for both of them is pretty tight so if you want if you want like a model of a rocket or a patch from one of the missions we we can sell that whether it's SpaceX or NASA and so what are some of the like what what are you going to do with boating are you going to build a harbor no I don't think we'll do real estate because I think real estate's a like the the Arbitrage in aviation is that you're taking a piece of land that has Beauty it's a beautiful piece of land but it's not next to a body of water to build a Lakefront H and so essentially what you're doing is you're taking this land and you're arbitraging because the the runway itself is the Arbitrage the fact that Pilots want to be there and so with boating it's not as if I can Arbitrage a lakefront property or an ocean front property because that's already awesome exactly there the markets already priced that in accordingly so for us we're looking at financing we're looking at e-commerce we're looking at other categories that uh we think we can be successful so probably won't be real estate um but it will be in other categories that we'll we'll look at Commerce you I think you said 40 million that you've raised for this whole thing yeah I had raised I mean between I mean my father funded has invested the money into we haven't used outside Capital if you will s family office of that 40 how much have you spent on Acquisitions no that's been the predominance of the investment it's been through m&a but you're going to do 60 million in Revenue this year I think on the Tweet you said 10 or 15% profit it's about our profit in March was 18% and we we think we can sustain 20 and we think ultimately it sort of like levels out around 30% uh so you're do 60 million in Revenue I think you said so that means 12 million in profit yeah remember that's a run rate number so that's full but yeah 60 million in uh R Revenue r a little bit over 60 with 20% margins and then what do you think that would be worth you know if you look at um sort of public comps you're probably talking 12 to 15 times earnings um is probably what if it was a public our goal is to get to a billion dollars um I I have no plans to sell this business I like having cash flowed Sam I do appreciate cash flow so it's not just taking risk I actually love cash flow you know it's funny as a venture-backed Founder um you kind of jealous I've heard this you've talked about this on your podcast before is you get jealous of the cash flow guys like yeah the cash flow guys get jealous of the valuation and Venture and the Venture guys almost every founder that I know are super jealous of the cash flow guys because like wait we built this fantastically High valued business but we don't see any of that money it goes you know ultimately until exit so but you you have both at at this point but you have so on 12 million in profit 10 times is a 120 is or no sorry you said uh 12 times 12 I mean you can look at if it was a private trade probably 10 times is a fair number um so the business is worth at 60 million run rate 12 million profit I don't I don't know if it's trailing 12 months Revenue whatever but roughly 120 million to $180 million that you that's what the business is worth uh you started this in 22 or 21 21 yeah that's awesome okay and then you said I think this is going to get to a billion in Revenue by 2030 is that that's our goal and we can do that through both organic and inorganic growth I mean here's the reality is there's 4500 magazine Publishers in there and see there's no exit for these guys I mean a lot of them are they're either owned by large corporations which frankly want to divest their print products because public cops are challenging for them uh or they're you know family-owned businesses where they've been running the business for multiple Generations or perhaps they started it 50 years ago whatever and they don't have an exit and so we can go find I me we're doing a deal right now where it's a in a business about a million and a half Revenue um about $600,000 and and when you take out all the expenses all the owner expenses about $600,000 a contribution we'll we'll pay less than one time for that business and so there's just not a lot of folks buying in this category and ultimately you're buying the audience I mean that's really what it's all about is yes we own and generate profit and that's great in cash flow But ultimately so I like to say we're a private Equity uh business meets Venture Capital because ultimately VCS want the asymmetric 100x return we're going to incubate businesses that can potentially bring those high level returns but using the audience which we already own and so I mean e-commerce is never going to hit that Mark but you have an aircraft Finance business you have a real estate project that very well could and we'll find other business models as we grow you're basically building a Hurst b style company so Hurst um have you read the chief the biography of uh William Randolph Hurst I have not you should man it's awesome so William Rand off Hurst he uh he had a successful father his successful father was a miner I think or like uh gold gold and in a gambling bet he won I think the San Francisco Chronicle and he goes to his son and he goes well William uh you've got the chronicle hopefully you can make it some into something you've got a year to to make it not lose money and so he uh he does that and he does it by creating what's called yellow journalism which is like clickbait of the late 1800s early 1900s and he kicks ass and he crushes it and he starts buying another thing another thing another thing he starts buying all these titles and he's killing it he's crushing it this is like uh a Cable business before cable where it's recurring Revenue subscriptions massive margins and then they uh they get so big so they do a bunch of things one they invest in this new sports network called ESN so now Hurst owns something like 30% or 40% or 50% I forget the number of ESPN that's they've made a billion off of that then they uh buy uh fit Finch ratings I think which is a Data Business which is exactly what you're in uh and they start buying all this stuff at this point Hurst is owned by the family it's one of the largest family-owned businesses in America they own this massive building in right in the heart of New York City my in-laws live literally five like I'm on my uh wife's like bedroom that she like grew up in and I can like reach out the window and touch like the Hearst building and I remember that was funny because I almost sold my company to them and I was like sleeping in that room when I was visiting New York City and uh anyway they this massive building that I don't think they got a loan on I think they own this like multi-billion dollar building they own a ranch in like Wyoming or something like that they own everything and it's owned by this family and it's kind of sick and it's been around for a hundred years that's sort of what you're you're doing you know Hurst is amazing because 10 10 billion or 12 billion of Revenue no debt like that's what's pretty astounding about HST not even on the real estate they they they're they're no debt they actually have a very large Venture Capital portfolio they're they're an investor in freightway by the way so that's one oh so you know all about them I met I forget who I met with there but I learned a lot about them but they're like older guys they're like they wear suits they're like the Mad Men era where they like yeah you know so it would have been a bad fit but that's what you're building and it's awesome look I think media businesses are underappreciated I think what's happened is the you know Hurst Hurst is they own a bunch of newspapers as well but I think what we're seeing now is this if you own a strong sort of around a media asset and you can build products that take that audience that's ultimately The Playbook is like I we have these audiences they love the content they're subscribing paying for a product which is a print magazine or a digital uh experience they're already the audience we can offer them products and services that they naturally buy anyways yeah that sounds like when you say that I'm like yeah that's so obvious but like everyone not everyone a lot of people have tried this few have succeeded uh hinki I think is succeeding there might be a couple others but like when BuzzFeed says they're going to do it it's [ __ ] it never works out I think it doesn't work out because they have like uh a committee deciding on these things whereas you could be a bit more of a a kind of a monarch where you're like this is what we're going to do go I think BuzzFeed along with a lot of other Publishers have sold out to programmatic and and have relied upon the the the platforms the Facebooks and the and no one really like loves them to too much uh what is Buzzfeed anyways it's like AAL like and I think the difference is that we're F we're buying magazines and media properties that had been around for decades where the audience like the people talk about their father the grandfather they you know reading trains magazine or model railroad or or or flying like they they they H it has a a lot of affinity to it and then effectively we just have to find services so we make money in media but then we have to find services that we can offer on top of that uh how many hours a week you working no I don't I don't count my hours you think you but like maybe like a normal 9 to5 40 hour week no I mean I I I do when I wake up at 6: in the morning because my kids wake me up till midnight I'm pretty much either with my kids or or working on the businesses so you're that's not work to me man like like I to me this isn't work these are this is a game in some ways I mean but you're still you're in Grind Mode it's not like this is all like awesome on a beach like I I do it to myself too like I end up getting overwhelmed and then I'm like I only have myself to blame what's your goal to you want to be a billionaire you want to just do cool [ __ ] you want to create something that lasts for 100 years what's what what no I mean one of the reasons I like media businesses because you're you're always learning something new and you get intellectually stimulated by a new challenge it's a new audience it's a it's a new product I don't know to me it's you don't want all the power Fame sex and drugs that comes with owning space magazine.com trains magazine is gonna give me enormous amount of power yeah or model ril rer no it's not that at all um and it's not even the wealth it's more of the chase it's the it's the putting up the score in some ways of solving problems and learning about a different I mean I we have a business that I paid $10,000 for it's called Aeros swag it's an e-commerce business it it will do $100,000 this year that is I spend more time on that business proportionately than any other one just because I think it's coal a print on demand T-shirt shop for for pilot I frankly should not be spending that much as much time as I do but I enjoy the to me it's a hobby it's a tinkering kind of thing I bet it feels awesome to make your dad regret firing you it was fun proving that I could make it work but I had a lot of that I mean had a lot of doubters when we first started the business yeah look behind most uccessful people is a girlfriend or boyfriend that broke up with them or a father said no that made like one rude comment or like in my case it was a a media executive who like he like halfhazard like in passing was like man these newsletters will never make more than a million dollars a year and like I was like you [ __ ] and you thought about that every day right every day and I see this guy on sitting at floor seats at the Knicks and I'm like you son of a [ __ ] so I would say the best thing to give a Founder is an anime so at freightways I had a guy he was he was a CEO of our largest competitor and he really pissed me off because he told me I couldn't couldn't compete against them you like I like to see you try whatever products and I I woke up every day thinking about him but he got fired and I tell you the motivation it wasn't as fun anymore because I needed him to be the guy all of a sudden the company became nice to me and it was like no I wanted that's all like please go back to be [ __ ] because it like I wake up more slightly more motivated every day I was like that with the founders of morning Brew I was like I want to kill you I'm like if I see you in public I'm I want to like get a fight now they're like my they're family to me they're like my best friends well you you are doing a you're hosting a PO one of the podcast on their platform so you know people say uh uh you know don't don't be hateful towards this person and in my head I'm like dude rage is like the greatest fuel ever it completely I don't you know someone once told me if you got Hate in Your Heart let it out I'm like no I'm burying that deep that a going nowhere that's fuel I need that but Sam you know it's also it's good for the team because if they also had the hatred of the enemy then they will they'll go much further and and fight harder than if than if you don't yeah I love that and it's sort of like a sport where you know like uh once once the whistle blows you're like anything goes but once the game's over like it's like all right you nothing but love nothing but respect but while we're in between those the the lines like we're getting after it yeah exactly and so I think it's good uh dude thanks for doing this yep enjoyed it Craig Fuller that's the pod [Music]

now there's something known as a rule of 72 mathematical Quirk that happens to work so for example if I'm getting a 7% return a year and I want to know how long is it going to take for this money to double I can take 72 divide by 7 it's approximately 10 years right now if I have a 10% interest rate if I do 72 divide by 10 it's 7 years so you can switch between the years or the interest rate and it tells you the other one the most important thing in life is how long does something take to double because that basically leads to everything else

data itself is not valuable it's what you can do with data that makes it valuable you've come on before and I was looking at the comments and they were all basically this guy's fantastic love his ideas more of this guy we need a part two we need a part two so here we are part two you went from selling PDFs to starting a a nine figure company so I got to hear this story in the beginning it was just ground in pound we're like hey $2,500 a month would be fantastic and Nick's like no no no no I'm not not interested in that we're going to price this at $112,000 $50,000 and $100,000 hey you know bro it's a PDF it's like only fans for hedge funds for 100 grand you get feet and the PDF exactly how much did you guys Bake Off the PDFs during that oneyear run uh like $700,000 we tried to sell chubby brain like the service to Goldman and they were like we can't use a service called chubby brain it wasn't just them being like hoyy toyy they were like listen at the bottom of every slide we put source for our data and we can't put Source chubby brain at the bottom because it kills our credibility and so that night you know John and I kind of went to a bar and we were like we got to change your name and that's when we became CB insights what are some of the data businesses that you think have legs a bunch of like people who are just driving 100 miles hour in the wrong direction I think the big thing is folks kind of thought oh I have data it has intrinsic value and that's the problem so there was an article that came out about 8 months ago it says CB insights to weigh $800 million sale that would mean that you could walk away with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars would you consider that to be a successful outcome or are you trying to go even bigger um [Music] all right what's up we got Anan here and we don't normally do this but actually we're going to make an exception for you I want to hear the founding story of CB insights because you guys started out selling like PDFs and [ __ ] like that and somehow that went from selling PDFs to starting a a you know nine fig company so I got to hear this story can you take us back to the beginning yeah sure thing so uh I left uh American Express where I work Jan 1 2008 had written a book were you a big dog at American Express or were you just like a normal gu there vice president so you know it was funny my my my wife's father was like oh you're vice president like next you're going to be president and she had like no idea there's like 40,000 other vice presidents that's what I used to think too I I heard VP I was like oh you're next to the line yeah yeah I was like but that's a pretty liberal job title right like they hand those things out yeah they they hand those out a lot to make you feel like you're you're doing well give people a sense you were making like like 200 Grand a year or something like that is that like roughly yeah 200 250 uh so you know it was good living but I always want to do my own thing left uh going to do this Consulting financial crisis hits big banks are main customer they basically are worried about staying solvent so they just ghost us and I'm paying two guys from my old team out of pocket and I'm just married so you know we're watching savings go down every week every two weeks and um we worked in the credit card industry so we said what could we do in that space and we started calling ex colleagues who worked at like capital one and City and other places and basically started doing this call it like a sentiment survey you know what do you think about delinquencies and loss rates like the the metrics that matter in that space and we'd give it back to them for free uh and they just liked it because they were like oh am I super optimistic and all my peers are super pessimistic like I need to recalibrate why did you originally think that that was a good idea like um usually I have to see something to even know oh that's a business oh cool like did you see something that existed and you were like we could do that for credit card data no no so I mean in the beginning we just stumbled into tons of things like I was just like I can't keep paying these people out of my pocket so it was like we were doing consulting for a school like we just kept our feet moving and anybody who' throw money at us like we were like yeah we'll do that for you like it didn't matter uh this was just an area this guy Dominic who's my you know my teammate he's like a savant on this stuff so we kind of were like hey maybe we could do this and and we like yeah it was just a guess okay so we started doing GLG calls you know the expert Network calls that was like making a little bit of money definitely not enough to cover costs and then we met this guy at this Prime broker and these are the guys who like settle trades for hedge funds and you know he was like hey I think we could sell this because the mortgage crisis was starting to like kind of get you know figured out he's like I think credit cards is what people are going to freak out about next and Nick's like the thing that the beauty of what he saw was like he wasn't worried about what his customers cared about today he's like this is what they're going to care about in the future um and so we're like yeah cool like we can't sell it maybe you can we I spammed every hedge fund guy who went to Wharton that I could find like nobody cared about what we had but what did you have was it literally just like you sent a survey to 20 people yeah it was a PDF that basically showed the trend of how people in the industry thought things were going in certain key metrics but how many people in that industry oh like 25 and so you're like oh we have vice presidents from AMX from visa from MasterCard whatever and the thing that they wanted was or the important data was basically like our delinquencies our defaults going to go up because that's going to spell that's going to cause like a bunch of Ripple effects and that had just happened with mortgages where if mortgages fail which nobody thought they would fail but when they failed it caused all these Ripple effects and Banks went under and all this stuff so so as an investor you needed that info is that correct yeah so there's that macro View and some of it is like hey I hold a billion dollars of American Express stock right and I need to put some number into a model that says how they're going to do the next quarter it's like a channel check right like you know like people go to Apple manufacturers and try to figure out how many you know hard drives or whatever they're shipping out to figure out how many MacBooks are going to be created this is kind of like the the digital equivalent of that so um and they're trying to like front run the the the quarterly earnings report that's going to come out later right you're basically trying to get inputs to guess yeah where they're going to be so that if it's bad news or if it's good news you can adjust accordingly before the rest of the market knows this information yeah like they're they're living in like an information vacuum and so this isn't like the number but it's a little bit of in in like leading indicator sentiment that they can use Sam he said Prime broker do you know what a prime broker is I I I have I have no idea sounds sounds pretty sick to be honest yeah is it Prime like prime time like this is awesome yeah so my I still this is my late person understanding so there's people who settle trades for hedge funds hedge funds buy and sell stock and there's somebody who executes that trade and what they would do is they'd bundle research as part of the trade so they'd be like hey if you trade with us I'll give you all these other Research Services and so they would call these soft dollars and I think these have been sort of banned and outlawed or changed since but we got at that time they were all this was all kosher and um why they're banned because you're you're influencing people to do stuff yeah I think it was like you know they were the stuff getting bundled in was maybe a little dicey and they just said listen just charge him for the trading as if it was trading and don't do all this other got it you know kind of migaa that like you know two gangs it's like the prime Brokers against the soft dollas it's like oh man these I don't know whose team I want to be on why is it called a soft dollar what what does that mean I think it's because it's like you're not being charged directly for it like it's bundled in right but you're being charged for the trading gotcha right so um so we go to Nick and and Nick we're like hey $2,500 you know a quarter or a month would be fantastic and Nick's like no no no no I'm not like I'm not interested in that we're going to price this at $112,000 $50,000 and $100,000 and we're like hey you know bro it's a PDF and uh he's like no no the way we're going to do this is 12 ,000 just gets you the PDF $50,000 gets you the PDF and a call and $100,000 gets you the PDF a call and anytime we hear something juicy we pick up the phone for you and only 10 of only 10 people can get that one right so like we get off the it's like only fans for hedge funds it's like for 100 grand you get feet and the PDF yeah exactly so so yeah so nobody bought the foot package right uh they but it was a great price anchor right and so what ended up happening was a bunch of people bought the 50k package and the and the 12K package and you know it was like a build one sell multiple times so that was going really well you know we knew from the get-go mortgages had a a lifespan of like the crisis had a lifespan and we knew credit cards would have that too but it helped us put away enough money and got you know me paying the team out of that business versus out of savings and then that's what funded CB Insight so that was but here's the craziest part to me 20 people is not a lot of people to survey how long did the survey take to complete uh I mean we would do this survey via the phone right and so like that would take you know I don't know hour and a half two hours per person right because you like want to get commentary right it's not just you think this is a 1 two 3 4 five right it was like trying to get you know context around it but yeah I mean it's not a large sample size I think the big thing here is when you're dealing in big big dollars some information is better than no information right that's that's insane to me because basically like so so the hard part is finding a problem that needs to be solved where like more information or or a survey could could solve it but basically I could go on GLG I can go on intro. Co I can go on all these websites I could pay someone $1,000 or $2,000 for an hour or two hours of their time ask them tons of questions aggregate all of that into a thing and then resell it as a research report report or a survey and that's crazy to me all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show those companies do that right I think the challenge that you'd have if you wanted to rebuild what we were building was we knew all the people at the card companies right and they trusted us to give us like to to have this conversation right if you just show up Sam and you're like hey chief risk officer at Capital One let's sit down and talk about what you're seeing they'll be like I can't I'm not going to I don't know what you're doing with that right so we were able to kind of they knew us so they knew we weren't going to like do some incendiary thing with it right it was that we're going to use this we're going to package it up into a survey it's going to be anonymized so it's never going to be a Capital One se's weakness or cities like flying on delinquencies right it was always like aggregated and anonymized so yeah like this these are great businesses like they're you know data cooperatives or pool data it just trust is like the big thing that you need in order to get people in the industry to open up to you how much did you guys bake do you think off the PDFs during that oneyear run uh we probably made like $700,000 and what was your reaction at the time I was like I don't have to go back to work at a big company like that was it like it was just relief right uh and yeah you know it felt in the in on PR reflection like we just stepped in [ __ ] like we just got super lucky that we met this guy Nick that he had the foresight to think about pricing this way so um but yeah I mean I was just thankful to be honest because I was like to go back 2010 2009 after leaving AMX like would have been going back sort of tail between my legs saying I couldn't hack it as an entrepreneur like the ego hit there would have been that that would have been that would have been the worst part that would have been like devastating I think for me so uh so yeah that was that was just happy Jason freed said something amazing when he uh when we talked to him a few months ago he said um it's better to be extra weird early on because as a company grows your um people start acting more corporate and so the more weird and unique you start as hopefully it's in it's inevitably going to get watered down but hopefully the watered down version is still unique and weird I didn't realize that CB insights stands for chubby brain and your original logo basically looks like me as an eight-year-old holding a brain and the name of the company is called chubby brain that is awesome yeah I like the the name it didn't work out uh and uh yeah we tried to sell chubby brain like the service to to Goldman and they were like we can't use a service called chubby brain and so uh and you know they they weren't it wasn't just them being like hoyy toyy they were like listen at the bottom of every slide we put source for our data and we can't put Source chubby brain at the bottom because it kills our credibility and so that night you know John and I kind of went to a bar and we were like we got to change your name and that's when we became CB insights so that was the that's the Genesis story of our name Sean have Sean and I have an LLC that HubSpot pay us pag us to and I'm pretty sure he wanted to name the LLC something like ridiculous do do you do I don't remember what it was Sean but I remember thinking I'm like I can't put this on an invoice it's like uh we're paying hood rat media let's that's what it was it was hood rat media yes you wanted to call it hood rat media and I was like Sean like no one was going to see Hood R media other than the accountant paying the bill and that's like the one person who we don't want to like think this is a scam right there was a I don't know if this is an apocryphal story there was some guy selling something online it was like a crappy product and everybody would ask for a refund and then he'd send them a check but the check would be from a company called like I like little boys Inc and so like nobody would actually cash the refund check because they were like I'm not going to go to the bank with like that bank or that company on the check so you said after the last episode you said that people reached out to you and we're going to get to like a bunch of different ideas you have but you said after the last episode people reached out to you saying like I want to do this data stuff and you said they're running a 100 miles an hour in the wrong direction and you wanted to correct people for uh who who were interested in this what what were you going to say to them those people yeah I think the big thing is folks kind of thought oh I have data it has intrinsic value and that's the problem like data itself is not value Val it's what you can do with data that makes it valuable so the customer doesn't care that you have data they don't care how hard it was for you to get they don't care it's proprietary they care you know about what Edge is it going to give them right and so like you have to think about the edge and the outcome you're going to drive for the customer up front so I I think of it as like three things like I call it like Eco so you got your The Edge you have to Define what that's going to be uh you have the C is can you collect it and then the O is just the opportunity right and so people would reach out they're like hey I have data on um you know how much media companies spend on their writers right and it was like okay you have it right like who's going to use it they're like I'm going to talk to like heads of editorial teams and it's like listen media companies one is a target or just a terrible place to sell like these are dying companies and you're trying to sell them stuff so bad thing there now you're trying to sell to an head of editorial who I'm painting with a broad brush probably isn't the most like data curious data aware type of person um so it was I think that's like a lot of it is like figure out what Edge it's going to drive and then you know obviously hopefully you can collect it and then how big is the opportunity right Financial Services uh AI companies now are big buyers of data um Tech uh and then like the sales and marketing adtech world like those are your big three verticals that you want to think about generally for you know there are big data businesses and other verticals but if you're starting at level zero and you're building a B2B data company think about the vertical and think about what Edge you're going to drive right like nice to have benchmarking data is like a quick way to you know build you could like maybe become like a thousand air off of like that type of company right like you're not going to build like a multi- ion Dollar business selling benchmarking data to unless it's benchmarks that like help you make big decisions you know salary benchmarks awesome right uh you know how much am I paying how much what are my delinquencies versus other big card companies amazing but if it's you know benchmarks on how much you pay for slack versus other people like nobody cares about that and so what was your checklist you said so basically who's the buyer like do they have do they have money and do they have do they care about this to what Edge does the data give them right that was like number two the most important thing is there a third and fourth criteria you have it's really I mean if I'm trying to if I boil it down it's the edge it's collection feasibility like how are you going to actually collect this information and then three is opportunity and on collection the big one is folks sometimes have a hack they're like oh I got to in with this person and they can give me this exhaust data from their company the problem with companies built like that is like when you lose access to the hack the whole company's dead right it's kind of like supply chain risk in our world like if if we bought all of our data from one provider and they decide to change the rules or go under like you're you're dead in the water so yeah so how you collect the data is the other one so yeah Edge collection and opportunity are the three that I would look at and really scrutinize a lot up front can you explain how how those worked like just to finish the story of chelby brain to CB Insight successful company what did CB insights do on those three criteria so you know who was the buyer what was the edge you gave them and then what was the collection feasibility yeah so the the buyer and it's changed over time initially it was investors and investment Banks so I think of like vcp investment Banks you know they are in the business of sourcing like that's one of their key responsibilities they make their money off of Finding and sourcing the right deals and what we saw was there wasn't a really structured way for folks to do that so that was the edge we wanted to deliver is we're going to give you access to more companies we're going to get them to you quicker and we're going to have deeper richer profiles on them so that's the the sort of sourcing Edge um over time it's it's more um you know the opportunity was in that group to start and I think that's another big thing is like start really narrow uh you know if I made a mistake along the way as we got too broad so opportunity was in that group The Edge was you know a sourcing Edge and then collection was in the beginning it was just ground and pound like it was we had 50,000 articles about funding and a events and me and the guys just went through manually and put in columns in a spreadsheet here's the investors here's the amount here's the valuation whatever we could find then we got lucky and hired some amazing engineers and they basically reverse engineered that process and automated it right and then over time now we do interviews and we do surveys so like there's seven ways to collect data at least the way I think about it now we probably do five out of those seven in the beginning it was just Brute Force like that's the way and I think like you know Henry shuck at Zoom info like they used to call into company switchboards or whatever and they'd be like hey what's Bob's extension and like that's how Zoom info would get you know Bob and I's you know number and extension so a lot of really good data businesses have been built doing really like data janitor work in the beginning and then over time they get more sophisticated and all that good stuff and you've done this like in a really cash efficient way I know that you've raised a series a but I think you've said like you're not even sure entirely if you needed to raise that money do you still own a large percentage of the company yeah yeah yeah that you know we raised late we bootst for six years uh you we like we're a very pain tolerant company I would say so we uh we raised after six years so yeah the team and I own like a you know a solid chunk of the company so there was an article that came out uh last year uh about eight months ago you don't have to say if this is true or not I'm just reading uh the headline of the article and it said it says CB insights to weigh $800 million sale so if that were true which you don't I don't want you to even say if it is or is not true that would mean that you could walk away with potentially hundreds of millions of dollars would you consider that to be a successful outcome given how like humbly the company started or are you trying to go even bigger I mean to say that's not a successful outcome would sound insane uh so yes that would be a successful outcome I do think there's a massive opportunity in front of the business and you know we hired a CEO earlier this year and he's a killer hey man Leo uh and uh so I think like I think this business especially with generative AI has like a lot of legs to grow but yeah I mean selling for 800 million back you know then uh would have been a fantastic outcome for everybody involved but yeah I think we can get even bigger what are some of the data businesses that you think have legs so you said a lot of people reached out saying hey I got access to this data and you're like I don't think you kind of have it quite right um are there businesses that you've seen or you think somebody should go build a Data Business in I haven't thought a ton about like new data businesses right I think the areas that are really interesting or ones to look at that are doing really well right there's one company I saw recently that was pretty awesome it's called Razor's Edge right and so what they do is I thought they're method of doing it was cool so they started they're like a database of of donors right so if you're a charity you need to raise from these high net worth folks and what they did was they started off with this database of donors and so you know people like Charities and Foundations and universities might buy it and what they then grew into was a CRM to help you basically manage your outbound and your entire relationship with them so they kind of did I imagine sort of this ground and pound method to capture this data in the beginning now what folks do is if Sam's running a charity and he uploads his list of donors they'll clean it and organize it and then everybody sort of gets the benefit of that clean data right and so like it's become a like a a pooled data data cooperative and then they've added workflow on top of it so I think that that's an an really impressive formula going from data to data Co-op to workflow tool right I think like that's kind of the future right because you want to get into people's workflow um so that's one company I really like uh that I've just kind of come across recently um you know the other area that I think is interesting I don't think anybody's doing this right so I think there's a a the potential for like a high-end glass door right so glass door sort of generates like this you know disaffected like group of people like to [ __ ] online um right right but like if you're if you're a hedge fund and you want to know like what's going on at the company a lot of that is a function of like how well is the CEO leading the organization and there's really no good way of understanding that so I think and again I haven't validated this I wonder if you could go out and interview you know maybe you have to pay them $1,000 $2,000 and say listen I want to interview execs on the team and X execs and I want to just you know I'm going to do this deep interview like what do people view as the you know the pros cons the Strategic vision of this CEO and basically like get kind of a inside view of the quality of and the followership of a CEO which you know may be an indicator of you know the quality of that business and how it's going to do in the future so I think like that's it that's an interesting idea and you can take these transcripts and use like generative AI to extract structure data from it so that's like one that I'm not going to work on it but I think could be interesting you know and again it like it hits a a high value segment right it's like the old like uh why'd you rob the bank because that's where the money is right like you know hedge funds are like hedge funds are a great you know a great kind of uh that that's pretty interesting to use the transcripts too or also the audio recordings have you ever had uh like an argument with your wife or something like that where it like imagine these PE Executives describing the CEO where you're like hey was a CEO any good uh and they'd be like he's good versus he's good do you know what I mean like like we're gonna look at like we're gonna look at the inflection of your voice uh yeah I would love to go you know what I mean yeah I mean you can do sentiment on it you can you know look at all sorts of things that I think could be interesting and again like it's not going to tell you to buy or sell that stock but it's another input right and and then there's these activist shareholders right and if you see like heyy listen over time you know ex CEO like the team is losing their faith in that person like now this becomes a reason for that activist to come and say Hey you know Joe who's running X like the he's lost the team and stock performance sucks and they're not doing these things right so it becomes an input and these are people who the buyers here like they're making hundreds of million dollar billion dollar decisions so I think that's another you know interesting Vector I don't you know there's probably all sorts of insider trading sort of complications that you got to deal with on that one so uh don't run with that when you check out this Razor's Edge thing uh because I you said that I got fascinated Anan do you know how much money Razor's Edge makes I do not know that so you were like this company looks interesting so they're publicly listed they're 2024 company guidance um over a billion dollars in Revenue 3 2% ibida $250 million of of free free cash flow here you go you heard it here first very impressive Sean when you had the milk road because I know we thought about this at the Hustle but it I wasn't mature enough to see the opportunity when you had the milk Road and even now as you have like kind of a mini media Empire have you thought about data monetizing it via data versus advertising I've thought about it but in know it's like asking you know my daughter have you thought about algebra she's like what maybe yeah sure it's like I don't even know what I would have been thinking about mean I for example with mil Crow we did what you're talking about we would go and we would interview whales so we would go to like 25 of the biggest crypto whales these are guys who are placing tens of millions or $100 million doll bets on nfts and coins and now remember with crypto if if you're a whale you're whales have multiple characteristics first it's a small Market second these guys have a big check so big check small Market equals they can actually move the market and third they're very influential meaning when they do something everybody else follows in because they have a reputation they became a whale because they picked something early on well so everybody thinks this person is the Oracle and we interviewed them and we talked about how what's your bullishness what's basically sentiment on the market we asked what projects they're most most bullish on so which what they pix are and we had all this info and then instead of selling it to maybe uh crypto funds or hedge funds or anybody like that we were like this would be a great lead magnet for free newsletter subscribers let's give it all away for free as a PDF in order to get subscribers and we did as like a it was a bonus if you referred people for example and that thing was so valuable actually that we didn't even really we didn't really understand the value that we had said it's like somebody who now airbnbs and makes 100K a year off their kids bedroom unused and at the time it just seemed like an empty room so we just thought it we didn't understand the value of that unused asset at that time I mean I think once you start a Data Business like you are now on a treadmill right like you have to somebody's buying a subscription right so what sea did was smart in the sense of like if it wasn't working he didn't have to keep doing it right but once you sell it to an institution now they're going to expect it quarterly or monthly and now you sort of are on this you know now you got to keep doing it right and so um so you know it's like you want to be thoughtful before you jump in two that I've thought of I'll shoot them at you uh these are Half Baked ideas but two that I've thought of in the past you tell me if you think they'd be good or bad ideas uh they're both very similar the first one is um head hunting Talent so executive Talent so all across the tech industry Talent is at a premium right so somebody who's a let's call it like VP SVP and up so all the way up to the SE Suite those people will make seven figures so so millions of dollars if not tens of millions of dollars as their package um when they go join a tech company and the way that the whole industry works is you have a four-year vesting cycle typically and knowing when somebody is ready to look for a new job is extremely valuable knowing when where they're at in their vest cycle that they might be willing to hop and switch um I think that's you know valuable information that could be used in the recruiting business which is typically just a Services business not a a very data driven business and so one idea was to understand the vesting cycles of the top 1% of silic Silicon Valley talent in order to maybe create a recruiting either a a recruiting data business or recruiting service business on top of that data that was the first idea quick reaction to that might be a bad idea I never did it yeah I probably I think the recruiting service business is a better idea than the data business I think with data when you have to try to get somebody to do a new Behavior that's really hard right and so recruit recruiters who are like used to you know it's really Network and it's very like hey I'll take you to lunch and like that kind of business and then being like hey now we have data right and again there are some ones that are like really data driven but I would say generally it's probably not their MO and so you know when you're like hey do this thing because it'll make you more powerful that you've never done before that's tends to be like a tough Hill to climb but building a Services business with this as your Edge I think is an interesting could be an interesting idea let me tell you another one that's not exactly data but I'll lump it in here so I saw this business called home options I loved the idea of this business so what this guy was doing was he was going to homeowners and he'd say who are not selling their home he's like hey I'll give you ,000 cash today for the right to sell your home whenever you're ready and they'd be like what do you mean he's like I'll give you a th bucks today you want to make a new patio you want to you want to buy a new couch here's th bucks today just to say when it comes time to sell my house I'll use you or one of your partners as my agent and then they would take those options and they would bundle them up and they would go to a broker in the area and they would say hey I have 500 home options like uh options to sell people's homes would you guys like to buy these for $3,000 or $2,000 whatever it was and then I'm making up the numbers here uh just to to kind of not put this guy's whole business model on blast but he would then sell it at an upcharge to them and they would say great we will happily take that because when these come to fruition each one of these options when they sell their home is worth $110,000 or $20,000 whatever it is right so there was like a business model built in and I thought this was genius I was like wow this guy's taking all of this like future leads giving them a no-brainer deal today and then immediately flipping it to somebody who's in the business of having those leads now the obviously the timeline is the hard part right when is somebody they're gonna sell their house 20 years from now 30 years from now and I'm sure there's some smart way to like filter for people that might be maybe younger maybe more mobile more willing to move in a sooner timeline I thought there was a similar business somebody could do in the tech world again just back to the world I know which is Anan you do CB insights you're leaving you're going to do a new company let's say as an investor those types of people are very very valuable and I would actually pay founder I know VCS would pay Founders like let's say sam right they're like Sam you did the hustle you're a great founder before you do Hampton if I could just pay for the option the right to invest in your next company and you get a bunch of cash today that might be runway for you to figure things out might be just go on vacation whatever you want to do with that cash and you're just saying cool I'll give you guys first look first R of refusal on my next company yeah I like that one I think you know VCS have these eirs entrepreneur and residence which kind of are like that right it's like you know hey I'm going to pay you and you can figure out your next idea I think the question I'd have is if somebody just had a successful exit is the amount you could give them going to actually be enough of an incentive but if you can figure that out right I there was a firm that did it wasn't this but they would basically send term sheets to startups they wanted to invest in right they' just be like hey here's a term sheet here's a valuation and like once you see that it sort of like inps you like you're like oh I think we're worth that and you might not be worth that but it would start the conversation so I wonder if you come up with the right number you just send a big mail merge to like all the founders who are meet the meet you know fit the bill and then just see if that generates conversations for you right and worst case they at least are like they have a they have they like you if you're not like a you know a dag in the meeting they like you and then when it is time they at least have a good impression of you like yeah it's an interesting deal flow idea now that you're no longer uh full on full duty at CB insights uh I know that you're kind of tinkering around with some other things and you're like in an interesting phase now where instead of being theoretical uh on MFM about which ideas you think are cool you're actually actually you know you're being practical you're like I I actually may pursue one of these things what do you think about doing yeah so and I don't think it's a may like I am going to do this so uh what I'm trying what we're working on is building a school of entrepreneuring so it's a in-person sixth to 12th grade uh school you know if you know the IMG Academy right like for sports right like the basic idea is like people go Pro in sports at a high school like you should be able to go pro in business IMG if I remember correctly it's like a school built mostly for athletes that are potentially going to go pro uh based in Florida and it was owned by Endeavor which owns UFC and TKO and whatever PBR whatever else Endeavor owns a large publicly traded company and they recently sold it for I think1 and a half billion dollars yeah and it's it's just a high school pretty much right is it a school or is it just a training facility you know it's it's a full school so it's a boarding school in Florida it started off as the bueter tennis academy and then it sort of morphed into this and they do all sports you know tennis track football basketball um and and they do summer camps like their big business their other big business is summer camps right uh or camps let's call them and dude if you're spending that much money to go to that high school for track and field in hopes of getting an R getting a return uh on your investment that's like that's not that's like going into a quarter million dollar debt for an art history degree you know what I mean like that it ain't there the thing that they've done really well is you know they recruit really Elite athletes and you know those those really Elite ones might get a scholarship or you know there's like um let's say there's five basketball teams at IMG the top team will actually get sponsorship from Nike and stuff that'll be used to defer or defay uh you know tuition costs so that really Elite athletes maybe get a free ride or close to Free Ride you know then everybody else who's probably quite good but also might have a parent or parents who think like you know little Bobby and Little Sally are going to go pro who just have like visions of their kid going pro in something will spend a lot of money you know I think tuition is like you know4 to7 70,000 um and then the camps are a great feeder for the school but they're also like you know parents want their kids to achieve a lot and they want to and you know they want to give them a lot of opportunity um and so the camps are you know I I'm with a broad brush like you know Dad who played baseball who always wanted to go pro can't go pro could could never make it you know wants their son you they think has a shot and they're like hey IMG is the best place to go and it is and then they uh you know and then they pay a lot of money from these camps so it's a pretty brilliant model they just got acquired by a company that's basically acquiring I think it's a European company that's acquiring private schools so private schools are just a giant business um and so they're acquiring private schools around the world uh they're kind of doing a roll up of those but yeah it's a you know img's you know great brand uh you know has had really legit athletes come out of it I love the idea of creating a school I love the idea of creating it as a as there's many variations of this idea but creating as a boarding school for around entrepreneurship or a different model of teaching so can you just like here's what I want you to do can you give me the two-minute impassioned rant the rant on what needs to change and what you're going to do what's broken and what you're going to do about it but I want you fire it up for this one all right all right so schools today are about compliance and Conformity right that's what they do and if you go back and look at how schools started it was Rockefeller and the sort of these Titans of Industry basically trying to create compliant Factory workers right and so when you go to it it's hey show up at school on this time sit in your seat we're going to tell you some tasks to do when the bell rings get up like a robot and go to the next class and then at the end of the day like you know we're going to dismiss you with another Bell right and so what they've done is create like people who are really good at reading a map you know and it's like a scavenger hunt hey I need some community service on my thing let me go do that I'll start some [ __ ] nonprofit to look good for college applications I'll play three years of a sport and so this checklist that you have to do you know to to navigate the map and I think what we need is a school for kids who actually are going to build the map like for explorers and developers um and so that's like what the school of entrepreneuring is about which is you know follow your curiosity and build stuff um and like learn how to think versus what to think right I think entrepreneuring is a lot like engineering you know even if you decide not to become an entrepreneur like you learn a way of thinking that's going to serve you well wherever you go but yeah the idea is like you'll go pro in business you won't take AP classes there'll be no sat ACT prep um it's going to be about um you know learning and building and it's really like experiential right so we're working on like having retail on campus so if you want to learn geometry you're going to lay out the floor plan of your retail store and that's how you're going to learn geometry it's not going to be you know hey let's learn the Pythagorean theorem in a class and then your kids like when the hell am I ever going to use this so um so yeah that's what weing on are you going to uh raise money for this thing uh so we've got you know a few folks already so we've got a decent amount of capital committed this is not like my next startup in the sense of like you know CB insights is going to check my significance box or success box this is like my significance box right and so I might start two three other companies like I'm trying to we're trying to think of an engine to like build 200,000 companies so this is like my next thing till like you know when I di at my desk like this is the thing that I'm going to be working on so it's not a it's not like a VC back private school to exit it's uh yeah and like I think the big thing is like recruiting formidable kids and this is one of the biggest challenges IMG has all these stats like you know who's the kid who jumps the highest and scores the most points we don't have that so it's like but the kid who has a 5,000 subscribers on YouTube is probably the kid who should be at this school not the kid who's like really good at at standardized tests right a kid who sold stuff on Roblox or built a lawnmowing business so yeah but this that's that's the vision where's your campus going to be don't know I think it's you know my partner on this is in La so it's you know the coast would be easy familywise interestingly red states are like much more open to education Innovation um and so like that's a conundrum we got to figure out so we're we we got a lot of work to do before we figure that out if I was betting money it's probably going to be on one of the coasts just because it makes Logistics of life easier but and what would that curricul look like to teach a sixth grader to prepare for this stuff I think it's it's not subject based right it's like Competency Based right so it's um you know critical thinking or it's uh uh public speaking or you know having conversations um and so a lot of it is like it's Project based and experiential right so you know what I mentioned earlier is like we're trying to figure out how to have retail onsite with the school and so the kids are operating and building a company and so in that you know in order to build the company you have to do algebra to build your model right you have to lay out the floor plan of the shelves in the in the retail store and that requires geometry right and so I think like you know I have have a daughter who's you know 14 and like she'll constantly come home and ask like hey when am I ever going to use this right like that's a common question and so we we're trying to find ways of integrating it organically into what you're doing so that you never feel like I'm learning something that makes no sense um and so that's you know what we're working on now we're talking to some teachers who can help us sort of build out the lesson plans here and uh and then you know kind of get going from there and the crazy thing about this business or the hardest part in my opinion it's like once Harvard becomes Harvard it's easy to maintain so like when you think about like all this uh protest going on people are like Harvard's going to [ __ ] these colleges going to [ __ ] in my opinion I hear that and I'm like no it's not it's with stood so much crap like once a brand is a brand it's really hard to ruin but it's hard to convince your first group of parents to actually become a customer of yours uh how are you going to solve that yeah so I actually don't think that's as hard so I posted this on Twitter I got a bunch of inbound from folks um who like really like the idea and I'd say it came from two camps it came from like rich people and then it came from I'd say generally people in the middle of the country who are like I have a son or daughter who's I think is really smart but who is struggling in the sort of cram exam erase model of schools like they're not good at like memorizing 50 state capitals but they're like really good at you know building an audience on YouTube or whatever right and they're like I think my kid has more potential than is being realized and I actually think there's a bunch of folks like that so I'd agree with you Sam if I said hey I'm trying to recruit we're trying to recruit Manhattan like Upper East Side parents right who like you know want like that old model but I think there's a bunch of folks and if you look at the homeschooling statistics and growth like there's a lot of people who are unhappy with how schooling is happening in this country and they're just opting out and so I think there's a big segment of people who feel like you know I've got a kid with a lot of potential who's just not that potential is being squashed um and so yeah I've had like a lot of good conversations with folks that you know I think the market for this is is giant actually and if we could recruit a hundred formidable kids from each state right like that's 5,000 kids you know uh I think that's very very feasible you have a few ideas on this list I want to go through can you tell us about these so let's start with the first one slime museums yeah so I don't know if you're kids Sean your kids might be old enough like slime is like crack cocaine for kids right so there's this place in New York City called The SLU Institute and my kids wanted to go there so we went on a weekend and we get in there and you know the thing I do when I go to a place when I see it packed I start talking to like the staff and I was like hey how many people come through this place and the woman was like well pre-co it was 12200 but right now we're doing like 5 to 600 a day and I was like per day day we spent $40 a ticket and then we spent another 30 for like an upsell where like they dump slime on your head and they video record it and stuff right so 70 bucks four of us so $280 you know when you start doing the math on this and then you know and then at the end they sell you slime and so it's like a let's say one out of five people actually buy it right so I came home I immediately went to Google Sheets I was like I got to put a model like a model together and I was like okay this one place in New York City probably does like6 to8 million of Revenue um and the beauty of it was that because it's slime like there were like 10 people who worked in this pretty big facility because it was really like interactive but you didn't need people to like run the exhibits it was just like the kids would just be like oh this slime smells like this and this slime is like greasy or whatever um and uh so it was really low overhead so like money printing machine I think I just read that they did 30 million now they have La Atlanta a couple other places so I think last year they did 30 million at these slime museums um and I think like in general these like kids experiential type of museums if you want to call it that you know Museum of Illusion Spy Museum like they all kill it and they've all like got this template where there's very it's very not labor intensive and I think like that's part of the genius so I loved this business and these two women are just killing it which is amazing so that was I think was a a big opportunity there and other experiential stuff I I just wish most of them were good like I we go to a bunch of them and like some of them are just like you just like grifty like money grabs and you're like oh man I spent like $250 for you know this but some of them like this one were quite excellent so that that was one yeah to me these are like the new Build-A-Bear Workshops it's uh out of the house it's a kids activity kids going to be super excited about it it could be birthday party it could just be a weekend it could be whatever and as the parent you know you buy the $40 ticket but it's never the end they're like the upsells are too strong in the moment right because you need the video you want the kid wants the slime on the way out it's basically like a a gift shop on the way out and um obviously these things have like a craze period where it becomes the thing and it gets written up in all the magazines and The New Yorker and you see it all all the influencers go and then and you know there is some normal on the other side of it but um it's interesting to see how people have reinvented the the Chuck-E-Cheeses of the world to be optimized around social media meaning how do you do things that are going to be photo worthy um that are going to be shared inherently um by people who are going through the experience and also you need to get kids out of the house off their screens doing things it's as a parent that you know there's a there's a huge need for that and there's kind of like a a much bigger appetite because even if you do the Slime Museum once twice a year there's a lot of other weekends that that you could do something so there can actually be many of these in this this model yeah for sure it's uh yeah it's pretty genius so that that was that's one area I'm thinking about um so the other one I think that's interesting so I ran across this company called D and it's like a giant like Amazon go store and so what they do is they go to property managers that have at least 200 like housing units in an area multif family and they'll say listen we're going to set up this like basically compact convenience store on your in your community and it's like stocked with all the good stuff right and so like you know I I live in a city but you know I go visit my mom you know if we need to get milk it's like I got to get in the car I got to drive eight minutes and I basically like spent a half hour of my life to buy something that's like $7 so what these guys do is they put this convenience store it's like Amazon go style so it's you know one person goes in they sort of they imagine only one person can be in the store they're on a clock so they got to get out in a certain amount of time and they just go and buy stuff and then it just sort of like Auto debits their account or whatever um and so you know they go to the property developer the property manager say listen I'm going to put up we'll put up the $100,000 to build this out and we'll restock it and we'll cut you in as a property manager on a on some of the revenue you know once we sort of recoup our investment um and so I thought like this is an amenity now that the property manager can offer to their to their tenants it's a revenue stream on top of it and so I thought for for Dow like I thought this was a really good distribution hack I guess for them and so I really like this idea and you know obviously by way we had this idea on the podcast like several years ago I don't know if you remember this this is one of the drunk ideas I believe uh in the I think it was in the drunk ideas episode might have been one of the other ones I was like why isn't there a neighborhood shop that basically run you know by the HOA in a way or uh you know by the by members of the community that and then all you do is wholesale in the the the products and you basically make take the markup of the uh of the rest and so you have a grocery store that's in the neighborhood basically um that's kind of what this is so do they have the tech like Amazon go where it auto figures out what you took off the shelf yeah so there's no Staffing because that's the big thing here right because what the property manager doesn't want is hey the store is not open because you know person an exent show up so this is 24x7 and you you know it's got the cameras and whatnot and you know again like reportedly um and yeah it'll just say you know hey your total bill is X and sort of those convenient store prices which tend to be you know kind of high margin and yeah you'll get build you know either to some credit card or maybe on your you know your HOA or something and you know the thing they talk about is over time they'll like learn to personalize like what's in the store right so if like you know this community really likes like you know certain type of Cheetos like that's what they're gonna see more of so this company looks like it's like brand new and Tiny like I can't find anything on the inter there's no founder there's no CEO I can't find anything it's really yeah so I I was just talking to a friend of mine who's in real estate and property management and so like he was telling me about this and he's like yeah they've got a bunch of facilities and you know I think they're targeting like the Sun Belt right like CU if you're in New York City you can walk to these things right but if you're in most areas of the Sun Belt the Carolinas Texas Etc like you just can't do that and so they're trying to solve that problem um yeah so I think their their app has six reviews so you have to have their app to get into the store it only has six reviews so I assume this is either brand new or just not popular yet it's early days I think they have a few facilities up and running right but um but yeah I just thought like the way they're going to Market you know essentially like they're sort of B to B to C right they're going to the property managers who then are blessing this and then they're going to you know the property managers because they have a vested interest in making money on this are going to start promoting it as well to their Community it's like a really smart did you do like the napkin math on like what you think this could be I didn't do that you know what I was trying to figure out was and my friend didn't know yet because they're in the negotiation phase I was like you know how much do they need to make back before you as the property manager start making money and what's the revenue cut there um but I mean this is like a scale play right like can they be the new dollar store in every multif family kind of community out there um and yeah I think like that's the angle and then you know I don't know if there's if are there certain large multif family property developers and managers they can go to and get all of a sudden you know hey we're now all of a sudden in a hundred you know developments so but I yeah I don't know I I suspect it's a big opportunity though all right you want to do one more of these yeah do more two more you just Sean just like dance again again put I put another coin in I want to go again let's go put another coin in yeah so um so my daughter's in the fantasy football and if you watch ESPN now I think it's like become unwatchable because it's all about gambling right it's like draft here's the line on this and you know blah blah blah and I'm like I don't really want her seeing all this and she'll ask me and you know I'm like I don't think this is a good thing so I started digging into the UK actually kind of did opened up online gaming a bunch of years earlier and if you look at the research there um to nobody's surprise it has not led to good things right like you know people are addicted and going into bankruptcy and all sorts of good things or bad things and so the US just whatever we do things we do them at times a 100 right and so the US is sort of doing this and so we're seeing this experiment play out that is going to create I think a lot of challenges and so I think the opportunity here is there used to be a business called I think American Addiction centers and they were basically for drug like drug and you know alcohol dependence I think there's a again another offline play in online addiction centers right so parents want their kids off the phone I'm addicted to porn I'm addicted to DraftKings I'm Addicted to You Know trading naked calls on Robin Hood like whatever it might be um and so you go there and I think the interesting thing here is there's all this commercial real estate that's available um you I wonder if you can get that really on the cheap and this is a group that's a little bit more you know like I I think if you went to a commercial real estate provider and said listen I'm going to bring in people who are addicted to hard drugs they're gonna be like no no no I don't want that right but this is a group like hey I'm going to bring in a bunch of nerds who can't get off their phone and we're going to treat them like the the risk to a property owner is a lot less from this group so I think you've got an opportunity to get real estate on the cheap and hopefully do some good in the world I think the challenge with these American Addiction Center and these other ones was like in a for-profit business you always want to lower the cost and so what ended up happening was like you know people weren't getting good outcomes and service was really bad and you know I think there were some really horrible things that happened so I think this is a big like uh inflection which is going to happen like we've just I mean I think DAV Busters now allows gambling on like Top Shot like you know Shawn and I are playing against each other like I can literally bet Sean like hey I'm going to get 10 and you're going to get less it is pretty ridiculous I was reading about um what what's the big one DraftKings or whatever they have account managers so if you become I I read about this one woman who is making like 150 Grand a year so uh whatever that puts her at in terms of class but not like crazy wealthy and she's and she lost all of her money and she was $500,000 in debt and she had an account manager that was like hey Kim um we just opened up this new game I know that you're a big fan of this type of game you might be able to win all your money back if you try this new one out because it has higher stakes and they had they had an account manager to like get her to start gambling more and it does freak you out and think in 15 years when the kids who are growing up with us what are they going to be like and there's actually probably an interesting case study Sean and I both lived in Australia and I don't know if you remember this Sean or if you were of drinking age when you went there but in all of the bars they have two things they have a room that has two things in it it's like the main bar and then a different room and the room has uh poke machines which is basically uh a slot machine but then it also has tons of TVs with every horse uh cricket match so like a horse racing cricket match I forget what else they have and you were just sitting there right there gambling you can gamble and get drunk and have a meal and it is like full all the time I wonder what's going what what what they've done to solve that similar problem that we are also going to face they're like well that's what the beer is for when you're done go over there and you'll feel better like that's the it's like restaurants that are like KFC Taco Bell combined in one it was like the seven deadly sins all Under One Roof yeah New York New York City had something like it was called OTB off trck bedding right and it was like horse races but there was no they didn't they didn't like do the uh the throat they didn't throw the alcohol grenade in there as well like it was you know New York has as standards right like we're not going to allow that so uh so yeah it was just just gambling but I mean yeah now it's just like on your phone so I I think like this is a in you know this is like a mega Trend that's gonna come out I I think you're you're definitely on to something this is um like the inflection is so real the influx of gambling into sports is like it happened overnight it went from never discust to everything is sponsored or integrated in about like if you're watching the NBA Playoffs it says in the third quarter it's like the line at the start of the game the current live action line is this and you know every player all the nil Deals they can do this now so there's like there's a the flood gates opened as to how much does get pushed on people as somebody who used to gamble a ton I know that for most people it's not going to work out they are not going to beat the house they are not going to going to beat the market and they're just going to lose their money and what I don't understand is I guess this is like a naive thing of mind is like the psychology around going to the addiction centers because everybody I knew who was in this space of like you're gambling starts out fun then sort of becomes a little bit unhealthy the way it goes I feel like 0% of those people were going to go voluntarily like go to Driver's Ed what I thought you were going to say is that you can get the companies like unlike the drug industry where like there's no there's no corporation that sells heroin right like that's not the there's no there's no one person to Target but DraftKings FanDuel these companies are going to have a giant Target on their back and they're money printers and so I thought you were going to say that they will as a sort of corporate social responsibility like cover your ass type of thing they might sponsor or pay for seats in all these different location like all these different areas and then you could provide the service for free for people I thought that might be where you were going with that do you think that's viable or no I you know I just I'm not too convinced that like a for-profit and you know Sam was just talking about these account managers for the whales right like I think they want to encourage those people to gamble more and like they talk about you if you read their 10ks and q's like they have a ESG initiative and they do this for people who are but you know I I gotta believe it's like you know kind of putting lip giving this lip service like I just you know I I can't believe they would do that you know I think if I'm DraftKings or FanDuel the thing I do is I have if I have a ventures team I invest in this and so then you know I create the problem and then I also benefit from The Cure so uh that's the you know the kind of the Evil Genius corporate way of doing it but yeah I don't I don't think they're gonna they're gonna you know drive this on their own I have just one other question for you it says your friend what what stuff are you really into right now are you like really digging any books shows you know Ren a rabbit holes that you're going down is there anything that you're super interested and fascinated by right now yeah you have the free time I'm pretty lasered in on like Youth Development right now right and education like that's where I'm spending all my time so there's a great book called Weapons of Mass instruction uh and it's basically like you know it's an I've never it's like a book it's the only book I describe as aggressive and it basically like talks about like how schools are totally broken and it's actually by an ex teer so that one's I thought was really good that I'm I really like that one um yeah that's a big area and the other area I'm spending a lot of time on is I'm talking to lots of professional sports coaches so um a big part of schooling is motivation and so I've talked to I've gotten into like the Texas Rangers and a couple college football team kind of coaching networks um and these guys they're yeah mostly guys they're amazing like I do a 30 minute Zoom with them and I'm like I want to run through a wall after talking to you right and and I'm trying to to figure out if what they do for athletes you could you know could you could you implant them in a school and could they do that same kind of motivating thing for young people in a different domain what's so good what do they do on the call that's so awesome I think what they they're really good at figuring out when they talk about um you know young people which is who they're generally coaching right they really like think about what they care about you know the beauty of it is it's actually not very complicated right they think about like what does that person care about so one of them is a coach on a minor league team and he's like listen that kid doesn't care if we make it to the World Series of like Triple A he's like that kid wants to get to Pros the pros right and so he's like I gotta work on I get everything I do has to ladder up for him to help him get there and you know the odds are very low right and so they're very selfless in the sense of like as the coach it would actually be better if that kid played his heart out and we won the World Series of triaa but the reality is if he does a really good job that player he's actually going to get called up and they're actually going to lose them so like they've just got this like way of thinking about um uh you know like what motivates people and like how to get into that and then they think a lot about like the team Dynamic really a lot and I I really I've found that really interesting and then there's a great book I read about the de lasal High School football team team so it's like the winningest high school football team in history uh it's out in California I think and the coach wrote this book and like half of it's like what drills do the safeties do and stuff like stuff I don't care about but there's like an upfront part about leadership and motivation and creating accountability that I actually think like anybody in a company should read like it is unreal because these kids aren't responsible to just the coaches or their school like they feel a really deep sense of responsibility to each other and I actually think like that's something we need more of and I really like there I think there's a lot of lessons that can be applied from Youth Development and sports to other domains you know whether it's corporate life or whether it's a school that we're trying to build what's the name of that book Chasing Perfection you know the the deal football way or something I think if you read the first half of the book before they start getting into like you know what o line drills they do and stuff it's really really good sounds similar to like uh the score takes care of it self is that the Bill Walsh Bill Walsh book yeah so you know same thing super successful football coach it's a football it's a sports book a football book but it's not at the same time it's a program building leadership book actually and it's an entire philosophy of like focus on the inputs the outputs will always take care of themselves if you got the inputs right yeah and um and how he kind of turned around a losing program into a winning one yeah I think the other thing he talks about a lot is like subtraction right like where just like you needs like a lot of teams want to add new things to they like want to add new plays he's like we have three plays on special teams we do like that's it right and so they really minimize and like it's actually like if you have young kids you ever seen those stride bikes yeah right like the Brilliance of that is they just subtracted pedals out right like it's like and it actually helps kids learn how to ride better and I don't think people think about subtracting stuff out they like always want to add and I actually found like there was a certain Genius of how this coach and his team or his coaching staff thought about simplifying a lot and subtracting complexity out and so yeah there's it's like a very profound book on many levels I I just think it's like it's a it's a really good one so that's another have you read the Talent Code no I'm GNA write that down that's a good one for you um in general you should check out uh my college roommate uh who's one of my best friends this guy Trevor Reagan he has a pretty fascinating story where he was like from a Tiny Town in Wyoming and um when I got to Duke they were like your roommate he's like trying out for the basketball team so I'm like sweet I'm looking out for you know a 66 black dude I'm like that's going to be my roommate and instead this 58 you know white kid from Wyoming shows up and I'm like you're the guy who's trying out for the team like what how's this going to work and um he was an incredible basketball player he was like the best basketball player in Wyoming his dad both of his parents were teachers and coaches and he always just thought okay I'm gonna play sports and then I'll go be a teacher and Coach too someday and what he did was when he went back to Wyoming he host he started with a summer camp and he was like all right I'm going to teach basketball and he he also like he was a manager on the Duke basketball team Duke basketball team is probably the most you know prestigious program in college basketball so he like took what he learned there but he was like you know what what do I wish I had when I like what would have made me a better player because he almost made the team he was the last guy cut and he's kind of kind of sat with him of like could I have done anything differently I thought I worked super hard so could I have worked smarter in any way was there anything that in my training protocol would have led me to actually make the team versus being the last final guy who didn't make the cut because it killed him to not be on the team that was his dream and like it's like you don't watch that story you don't watch the Rudy movie where you where he doesn't get to play but that was what happened in his life and it's like damn that sucks I didn't even really believe that that was a possible outcome but it was and so he when he went back his summer camp he's teaching you know I don't know seventh grade girls and they would be doing a layup drill but he put a giant TV screen with a too like kind of an instant replay of what they were doing so cuz he's like one of the things is you never as a youth player you never get to see yourself doing anything um like the the or the feedback loop is there's like a huge gap between when you're playing in the gym to when you finally might one day see like some film of you that then then you'll be told hey you should do this differently next time and then another three days goes by before you're back in the gym doing that thing so instead he like shortened the feedback loop and he started and then he went and studied all these coaches he went and hung out with Pete Carol he went and hung out with the best like he would find that the women Olympic volleyball team in the US dominates so he went and studied under that coach to be like how does he run his program and he was just like he'd run camps during the summer which is only three months and then nine months out of the year he would just go learn and I thought it was fascinating he did that for like you know seven years so now he has this uh he puts out free content that's like in his thing called the Learners lab which is basically it's like how the the science of learning how do you become a better learner and he started it with with sports but then he realized like pretty quickly oh this applies to everything like business SCH uh School whatever and he gets brought in by all these sports teams and big companies to give talks to like how do you actually teach people how to learn better how do you create a environment like basically his theory is almost like if the soil is good the plants will grow and like if you're wondering why your plants aren't growing have you ever looked at your soil maybe your soil is messed up like maybe the the setup the culture the environment that you're you're setting up here is not going to lead to that type of growth and so he's put out a bunch of fascinating stuff that I haven't really heard anybody else do you should check it out one of the genius things he did was like huberman he went and read all the white papers about learning and mo like motor development and all this stuff and then he's like dude this is gold it's just buried in an old scientific white paper that was made by an old white scientist who doesn't know anything about social media or how to get the message out there so he would go read all these and then he would turn it into like an animated video and put it up on YouTube and these videos that seem so Niche can get like a million views because it's actually interesting content but it was just stuck in Science World which was not like applicable to where where most people go look for information or entertainment yeah I should check out Trevor's stuff like he sounds like he's doing sort of God's work there which is awesome but yeah there's a ton of like amazing research about Youth Development education learning that like people just ignore like it's like proven stuff that says you know if you want a young person to like learn something you should quiz them daily like it's shown to work but like if you talked I've talked to probably 70 or 80 teachers not a single one can does it and part of it is like it's logistically challenging so I understand that but but there's so many things at work and like we still treat education very artisanally right it's like you know it's like everybody's an artist like oh Sam likes teaching history this way and Sean likes teaching it this way and Anan likes teaching it this way it's like hey just go and like do like improv you know and instead of being like Oh what Sam does works like Sean and Anand like follow the script because like the kids love it and like it works and you can color Outside the Lines a little bit but you can't like go Rogue and just come up with your own thing so yeah I think I'll check I'll check that out but yeah there's a ton of like really smart people who dug into this we just for whatever reason we just seem to ignore it in that monish bab interview we just did he said something he's like the like the something like the neurons in the brain and normally I'm like you're an investor what do you know about the neurons in the brain but I was at his house and like one whole wall was all just science books it's like there's like an investing book section there's a huge section of just science books either psychology or biology or physics whatever it was and he was just telling me about all these different books he was reading and what he liked in each one and one of the things he was saying was between the ages I forgot what he said like 10 to 19 or something like that like 80 90% of the neural connections formed during that time and it's basically the peak time to specialize and he's like if you look at all the great ones whether it's like you know the great musicians whether it's Warren Buffett you know buying his first stock at age 10 it's like the great ones at every field during that key gold period they begin to like really go deep on an area and become great at that and not everybody should specialize but the people who really want to become the outliers and do great like that is the the Golden Era and I'm sitting there I'm like oh I guess uh guess I missed the boat like I don't know I don't know what I was doing during that time but it wasn't that and he's like well you always got your kids you know to try yeah for sure yeah I mean you know I spent eight years in Spanish and like I can say may Anand PUO Alban which is like my name's Anand where's the bathroom right and so like that's a waste of time for everybody involved right and instead I took Spanish for three years I it's just no hoo that's all I got you got it you got it strong H in that hoo you didn't even say what you don't speak you're just like I don't speak yeah uh yeah so we got your neurons working on that which is you know so I think like there's a lot of like yeah wasted potential wasted time here and yeah that neurons thing that the thing he said about you know if somebody has a lemonade stand early in life like that's a great sort of indicator like yeah I gotta believe that's certainly like a sign of somebody who's formidable that is you know could do great things uh and so yeah I think we got to tap into that a lot more um thanks for doing this dude round two done right cool yeah well do you want people to follow you anywhere or get more of you on any uh any platform uh yeah asan Will on Twitter or uh my name on LinkedIn I'm I'm on LinkedIn Voice or something so you know I don't mean to brag but that's that's my thing so yeah follow me there I don't think that's a brag it is it is AAG for the record that is a full-on brag right there I'm pretty I'm big on LinkedIn is actually I I framed it I framed my uh I framed my thing it's uh it's in our bedroom do you make your wife look at that before to bed you realize the prize that you got yeah it's it's a big it's a big thing whenever we get in a fight I'm like let's go into the room and look at the uh the LinkedIn influencer thing I got you play the cards your delt I suppose all right this is this has been fun man all right man thanks all right see you [Music]

Sam this podcast is not Financial advice but if I was going to give anyone Financial advice I would have said rewind the clock to May 1st just a month ago and all you need to do if you ever want to Triple your money forget Warren Buffett forget Bill akman all you had to do was Buy Gamestop again [Music] again on the Mount Rushmore of investing there's Bill Amman there's Warren Buffett these wise older men who uh just exude confidence exude wisdom right next to them is deep [ __ ] value that's the world we're living in right now so a lot has happened with this guy let's tell a little bit of the background of who this person is and what happened all right so it starts what year did this start in probably 2020 so like Peak zero interest CO's happening a lot of people are stre online and saying their thoughts because they're working from home there's this guy named Keith Gil Keith Gil I think he worked at like Mass Mutual or like just some normal boring job like a $100,000 a year job however he loves Stock Investing like he studies it and turns out he's a very charismatic guy and he starts streaming some of his picks and why he likes certain companies whatever now we all remember that in 2000 20 2020 2021 the stock market went crazy and there was a subreddit called Wall Street bets and a lot of people had extra income because of whatever was happening and they were betting crazy amounts of money on silly stocks well this guy Keith Gil he has a username on Reddit called Deep [ __ ] value and then he has a YouTube page called roaring Kitty and he starts explaining why he likes GameStop and he invests roughly $56,000 which at the time I think that was like all of his money and he just goes on this this this kind of campaign explaining why he likes that stock and it's kind of like an Underdog Story it's this kind of nobody charismatic cool guy versus the large companies and the reason he starts investing into gamestock is these large companies these large head funds he finds out they're shorting the company and he was like I actually think they're wrong I think this is great and so it becomes a little bit of a Robin Hood David Goliath type of story and all of Reddit all of Twitter Gets behind Keith Gil deep [ __ ] value roaring Kitty and the stock goes crazy he makes something like $30 million off of his $50,000 investment and he spends about how long was that 18 months two years like with his campaign talking about it but then he makes $30 million he goes silent nothing happens there's a movie made about him with Seth Rogan it was an awesome movie uh but at the end of the movie they go we try to get Keith gild to comment on this movie and give us ins Insight he didn't say anything he's been silent we haven't heard from him until last month it all changed what happened so great summary last month uh roaring Kitty as he's known he's got a couple different names right there's his Reddit username but then roaring Kitty was kind of his uh his streaming name and he comes back on Twitter and he just posts a meme and it's the meme of the guy uh sitting in his chair and then starts to lean forward like he just became interested in something the gamer lean the gamer lean the lean in many of you listen to podcast right now might have the gamer lean going and I hope you do but he posts that nobody knows what it means it's cryptic and then he posting some more cryptic videos little Mas that tweet got 30 million views yeah people are ready and um and immediately like stock pops a little bit but nobody knows what it means and nobody knows really what happened to this guy during that run where he turned basically like $56,000 into you know tens of millions of dollars he held the whole way so what everybody thought was great the short squeeze is great what happens when people start to take gains this whole thing's going to collapse and sure enough that is kind of what happened it didn't stay at the peak I think at the peak it was like $480 and it did start to come down but he had as we say in crypto Diamond hands and he did not sell during that time or nobody knew what what he was doing during that time but he had never there was no evidence of him selling so he comes back he starts posting all these clips and people start getting excited and what's happened in the last uh you know I don't know month or so is the stock has tripled and it's tripled in spite of Robin Hood and others halting the stock again because like last night and after hours it was up up 100% your money just doubled last night if you uh if you had bought yesterday um and then they had to Halt the thing because it's like you know pretty like abnormal behavior that's going on in the after hours trading so the internet's going crazy he then goes and posts on Reddit and he goes into a r sub called super stunk and so he goes into Super stunk and he says here's my gamestock my GameStop YOLO update and he post this screenshot and the screenshot essentially shows that he currently has between his equity and his colle options $20 and something million dollar worth of GameStop which basically means that and people aren't exactly sure when all this started but there's a Twitter handle called unusual whales unusual whales they is unusual whales.com I believe it's a uh option buying platform and they noticed then they they started reporting on this on their own platform they said a few uh a few weeks ago they go someone is buying 2 million a day and they're a whale what is going on and they've been doing it for 3 weeks and a call option basically and I'm an idiot when it comes to this stuff it basically just means they think the stock is going to go up and they leveraged their money to buy a ton of uh uh options to purchase the stock at a agreed upon price I think his agreed upon price was $20 he starts accumulating that share or that stake no one knows who it is and just last night I think or the night before he revealed it was him he's been doing this all along yeah it's insane and uh so you know currently right now today it's up another 24% he's basically doing it again and the the hedge funds I believe were shorting it again so I'm not again that's the part I'm not 100% sure on is like initially the appeal for doing this was um he would say you know I like the stock I believe in the company he would say those things but it was unclear how much of it was his belief in the company versus his belief that the hedge funds had shorted more than 100% of the stock flow so it was like just massively massively shorted and the way the shorting works is you're basically betting that the the stock is going to go down and so as the stock Rises your losses like normally let's say you buy a stock for $100 the most you can lose is $100 that's what you bought the stock for that's all you have if it goes to zero you lost your 100 when you short a stock you can lose an infinite amount of money and it's basically what happened to these hedge funds they lost billions of dollars by shorting GameStop because when Keith and then all the other people on Reddit started buying it created a short squeeze meaning the price was going up so much that they were getting called in say hey you need to cover your positions you need to they need to now buy the stock at this elevated price in order to to cover their short and so that put you know a couple of them almost out of business one I think one or two went out of business and another one had to get a bailout basically and there's a lot of accusation of collusion meaning these big hedge funds colluded together uh some of the hedge funds had a stake in the company Robin Hood and they called Robin Hood and said hey we need your help on this you can't let these guys keep doing this stuff and so it was a a David versus Goliath situation of like can the little nobody retail invest investor somehow beat Corporate America beat the big billion dollar hedge funds and for what it's by the way I think it's totally true I don't think this is a whack conspiracy theory so I don't think they owned a stake in GameStop what I think was uh they were the market maker yeah so they were one of the biggest market makers and then you know everybody said no we didn't call them and tell them to Halt the stock what they did was they halted buying but they allowed selling which is like you know that's it's sort of the most effed up thing you could do to a stock and people lost like their life savings in this and some people say oh they should have because they were just gambling okay there is something called just gambling but if the casino rigs the dice that's not cool right uh and that's what appears to have happened here where if you shut down buying but you allow selling for a period of time you will relieve the pressure and the short squeeze and the stock will start to fall and then people start to sell because they think oh the game's up and so I took all my money I don't know about you I took all my money off of Robin Hood after that happened I just fundamentally morally was against what had happened I believe that the CEO lied um and is continues to lie basically about what happened during during that period time I also took all my money off Robin Hood I didn't have a significant amount but like Robin Hood started as like the Underdog Story and this is a tal as old this time at least in Silicon Valley which is like the underdog is like they're the coolest and the best we're all behind them and then they get big and then all of a sudden they are the man and they start changing some of the things the way they do things and now I don't trust them right but I I actually so I currently have two takes on this number one we've talked about the Creator economy which I think is mostly a lame thing to talk about but basically uh the some of the cool stories are some of these creators like Logan Paul they now have a billion dollar company with prime roaring Kitty is the exact same thing but instead of selling Prime energy drinks or whatever he's selling uh not Financial advice take oh my God I'm so jealous I didn't have this take holy [ __ ] that might have been the most insightful thing you've said in months this is his version of monetizing his audience and it is beautiful and here's why it's beautiful have you seen the movie uh what's it called uh dumb money so they chose this to play Keith Gil and I've seen a lot of Keith videos he's so much more charismatic than the actor who played him right they if he would have been that actor it would have been way better and so when you watch his videos I think I want to get behind you he is so likable and so he is monetizing his Fame in such an interesting way all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copyrighting we've talked about copyrighting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we've give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copywriting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show so let me just let's just make that point again so what you said is basically we've seen all the Creator Brands you've seen febles you've seen Prime you've seen whatever a thousand of these he did it without having to sweat the actual business he's like oh yeah cool like how about instead of having to actually sell products and fulfill customer orders and do customer support and all that I'll just pick a stock and make the stock go up and the product is you might make money on this stock and not saying that he intentionally tried to do that or whatever but like in a way he did right he was streaming himself picking a stock doing his analysis and the one thing I will say because I went and watched these videos is I expected it to be a lot more like pump and dumpy meaning I expected it to be like either explicitly said or reading between the lines like hey guys let's just do this and make a buck and he really doesn't say that or do that in any of his like videos or his his updates and maybe it's because he kind of had a job at a financial company he knew not to to cross that line I don't know maybe that's why maybe he genuinely just liked the company in the stock and was like yeah I think there's value here and in some ways got lucky he didn't mean to start a revolution he just did so I'm not sure which one it is but I'm very impressed that I expected him to be a lot more uh unrespectable but actually when I watched his videos on fr's content I actually respected him a lot uh I thought that he was not trying to you know a grifter trying to make a buck he did not come off that way and the movie uh which I think was a hit they made him not come off that way they can't they made him they made him and his wife come off as very romantic characters they made the people who followed him they like showed like a poor lady in the Bronx or something she was like I really believe in this guy he's the best we can't let the big guys win and so you get behind it it's easy to get behind the second take that I have I think what he's doing is not illegal but it might eventually become illegal what what he is doing is absolutely so here's my opinion we don't know what he has done between uh basically when he made his 30 million and up until 3 weeks ago we don't know what what had happened what I had if I had to make a prediction I think he tweeted TW out this gamer leanin so he tweeted out this gamer leanin uh meme or whatever and the stock uh jumped I think 80% that day which is insane so he was he ultimately I think GameStop at the time was worth uh six billion and then it was worth seven or eight I I you got to go look at those numbers but he basically created something like a billion or at least hundreds of millions of dollars in value from a silly tweet I think that there's a potential that uh he was do he was like knew that him saying something online was going to pop the stock and that he is profiting from that and then further after that bought the Cs you know what I mean no no I think it's the other way around so I think what would make sense is he buys the calls first it's cheap and then he then he announces it but his announcement I mean how you going to get in trouble like you know I posted a meme of this guy leading forward what it's not illegal it's not it's not illegal and he it's very wise and so other tweets that he posted are uh the what did he post the reverse Uno car just a picture of a of a reverse Uno car like we're running it back yeah and I think it's hilarious I think it's hilarious that uh uh Nikita our friend said if you've been toying away at your startup for the last decade just remember a guy in his basement with a webcam and a headband just made close to a billion dollars in 12 hours and I think that that's uh pretty wild and potentially uh there there is going to be some blowback uh for Keith Gil but if you think about it Bill akman announced I think last week that he's considering taking his company uh his hedge fund purging Square public and what Bill Amman is doing is not terribly different than what Warren Buffett has done what Howard markx has done what what Manish the guy we had you had in the Pod what these guys have done which is they've built a brand for themselves and when you build a brand for yourselves in the in the hedge fund or trading industry it basically just means uh whatever Warren does I'm G to follow because I trust him and so it adds value to a company that is not necessarily in the fundamentals of the business and that is exactly what's happening with roaring Kitty and I find it fascinating I don't know am I'm I'm behind it because I like him and I want him to win but I do have to ask myself is this actually like ethical and correct it's borderline I think so here's a couple of interesting bits so GameStop stock currently $28 as of recording this if the stock hits $70 a share he's a billionaire insane which is just kind of incredible insane the second thing that's really interesting here is some open questions that I have and and I think if it's not obvious by now we're noobs when it comes to this we are not stock Traders we are not options Traders this is not the world we live in we are both me and Sam we are startup guys we build businesses we start companies that are tech companies um our this is not our game but I do have some very simple questions as a beginner here which is if he's buying basically on average I think two two and a half million dollar worth of options per day for the last like you know 11 days or something like that where did the money come from where's the money come from this is a guy who didn't have money he made a bunch of money in GameStop how did he have the ability to buy like $60 Million worth of these calls he bought that's my point I think there's more behind the scenes he owns $5 million of uh five million shares of GameStop which is worth5 million and then he has $65 Million worth of call options so there's some theories on this so that's the the first question is how did he do this and the theories are basically I I don't know if this is true but here's here's a theory that this guy Jonah lton uh posted on Twitter he goes I'm trying to figure out how roring kitty ended up with 180 million plus what's now $210 million of GameStop here's my best guess in late April early may he sold most of his equity and loaded up on calls then he came back to social media posted the meme and it went up 300% in like you know three days if he sold his calls near the top that would give him cash back he which he would then go back to buy equity and then he decided to do this game again recently and he's basically using this scheme of like sell Equity buy calls sell calls at the top now you have a lot calls are basically like a leverage way to buy take that leverage leverag gains that you have now buy Equity again and you know rinse and repeat basically so he's like this is insane I've never seen anything like this before his his Twitter page instead of the word post it should just say a dollar sign that's his ATM every time he clicks that button he's like that's how much power this guy has and it's insane yeah yeah everything about him needs to he needs a Rebrand roring Kitty is now like the fierce lion like he's no kitty this guy is is just legendary I mean the tweet about this are also just hilarious I one Brandon Bole we can put these up I'm telling my daughter that this was Warren Buffett and it's just a k picture of him wearing his purple like cat shirt at home um Trung your boy Trung uh posted uh here's roran Kitty and his $180 million GameStop position rolling up to the stock market tomorrow and it's the wheelbarrow with like the guy from South Park with giant balls in the wheelbarrow he's got I mean these are it's really really pretty crazy another one um quiver quantitative is saying depending on how GameStop moves tomor his net worth is about to pass the other great stock Trader in history Nancy Pelosi she's currently at 245 million estimated he's at 210 and they said two legendary investors at the top of their game it's great it's great this is a a very captivating story well there's there's the obvious question which is what do you do about this so during the first GameStop runup I went through like whatever the you know seven stages of grief it's like the seven stages of fomo which was uh first I ignored it h irrelevant to me who cares then I became dismissive and I said why are you guys wasting your time on this this is stupid this is not like GameStop really there's no like you're going to lose your money then I became jealous as all my friends made money doing this and all the random strangers on the internet who were doing the dumb thing were making the money and then I went to uh chasing fomo and I bought $100,000 worth of GameStop during that last grade no way did you really I think I made like I don't know what I made I made like 50 Grand or something like that off of it like 50% I sold and I got out um and then I became confused and then I went back to ignoring it again and that was my cycle and so the question is what am I going to do during this cycle I already have ignored the first leanin meme saw that ignored it didn't even know what to do with it um didn't pay attention to the uh the next two tweets either I should be entering jealousy currently I all I need is a few text messages uh I'll enter jealousy then I'll Chase then I'll uh you know I'll reap the consequences of that we'll see what happens I think you should do nothing I will do nothing that's the that's the honest opinion I think that that is a mature answer even making money last time it didn't feel good it was a have you ever read the Annie Dukes uh book where it's it talks about this term resulting no it's like uh she's a poker player and it's you know it's the idea of you you pay a you play a bad hand in poker but you got lucky you know on the river you got your card and is your conclusion from that I'm a genius and this was a good play and like for a lot of people unfortunately that is how they they result if if something goes badly they assume it was a bad decision if something goes goes well they assume it was a good decision when actually like the decision and the result are in many ways disconnected and you should be able to an analyze a decision without um without only basing it on without only basing it on the result and so similarly even though I made money last time uh I think that would be resulting to say that was a good idea in fact all I did was probably waste three days of my attention focused on this random stock that who gives a [ __ ] so there's one person in this story that's not being discussed right now um and I think that over the next handful of months he's going to be a lot more famous uh and so that's Ryan Cohen so Ryan Cohen he is most famous for starting chewy.com chewy.com was a a pet food company my co-founder Joe my business partner Joe also owned a pet food company first and then chewy.com came about and chewy.com their whole thing was we're going to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and we're going to spend like crazy on marketing we're going to lose money on our customers for a long time and we're going to provide such a wonderful experience that hopefully they come back for us and they like us so much whatever he was right Ryan Cohen was right chewy.com worked my friend or my partner Joe's company went out of business and it became a huge success he sold it for three and a half billion do well when he made his money I think he made roughly $500 million he put virtually 100% of it into two stocks apple and Wells Fargo and there was this big article written in the Wall Street Journal about them and that's when we started learning Ryan Cohen is kind of uh he's different not he's he's he's different not even amongst like the average person because he started and sold the company for that much money he's different even amongst crazy people who are talented enough to do that David gogins he's uncommon amongst uncommon men yeah and so he starts becoming an activist investor where he starts uh buying stakes and companies that he thinks aren't do going so well so well let's do the numbers he put 250 million into Apple in 2017 that stake is now worth over a billion wow I don't know what happened with the Fargo one but he put 76 million into uh GameStop back when it was like $4 or5 a share so he owns 13% of the company uh 10% 10 and a half perent now he's also the CEO now so he's he's been in he's actually running the company now that's bought himself a job it's working and he did the same with bad bath meon which was uh for a minute another meme stock but he would buy I believe if you buy a larger than a 5% stake in a publicly traded company you have to uh reveal to disclose it and so he's done that a few times and he's become an activist investor where if he buys 5% of your company that means something's going wrong as in management is screwing up but the company has potential and then Wall Street bets and the rest of these crazy dgen retail investors see it and they buy into the company anyway Ryan Cohen has been present for all of this Ryan Cohen is only 37 or 38 years old he's a young guy and he is still a as of right now I believe he's still the CEO of gamestock and so GameStop and I'm very curious to see what's going to happen with him over the next handful of months and I would love to get him on the podcast because I think he is a guy who is not just interesting for his chewy business but I think that he's a guy who uh thinks very very differently and has very strong will and uh we're going to see a lot from him over the next handful of months I think he only follows one person on Twitter who unfortunately it's not royan kitty it's just the GameStop corporate account really should follow is roring Kitty he should either swap it or or go to two followers on Twitter Ryan that's my only criticism of you otherwise I have no notes uh yeah so it's just a crazy story well where where is this guy now where is Keith Gil in the movie he was in Massachusetts and what what do you know about Massachusetts in the wintertime it's the worst right coold bitter Cole horrible he disappeared for the last two or three years Massachusetts in in the winter time very uninspiring this guy just made a huge bet he needs some inspiration where do you think he would be going out uh he should Voyage around Voyage no it's not quite the right word he should uh Scamper around no no no no that's not it that's not the right word what do you I think he should wander I think he should wander around and that's today's sponsor wanderer.com that was a that was a good plug what is wander what is wanderer.com so wanderer's a dope business me and you both invest in this because we are big Believers in this but uh we both like to travel but when we travel it's like you got a couple options normal the normal options where Hotel you go to hotel and you're like okay great I'm staying in this kind of like I get all the luxury amenities I get the service but I'm in this tiny box or you go do a vacation rental maybe on a sharebnb or something like that and you um you might get a bigger space you might get more rooms it feels like a home but now you don't have the service and it's a it's like a box of chocolate it's just like very Hit or Miss what you're going to get I was an Airbnb host and I could tell you my internet was definitely the cheapest internet that money could buy and it was not very good Sam's a stunning views where is like plant right outside the window sill yes it it wasn't great so uh Wander basically operates a bunch of really fancy luxurious uh properties that you could stay in they built it so it's kind of Geared for like remote workers but also high-end [ __ ] so uh every or most of their properties have uh gyms they've got work uh work desk set up so check this out so I'm looking at a trip right now that I was going to take with my family because uh I want to you know get out of the house a little bit and I was like originally planning for a hotel but a hotel I now have three kids three three kids that are under the age of you know five and uh a hotel room now is actually Guantanamo Bay if you put all five of us in a room like we just put the Do Not Disturb thing up there out of Shame we're like don't come in here you don't want to know what's going on in this room this room is like chaos now being disturbed um you know it's Guantanamo Bay in there so so that's not working um but I would still want to be able to get [ __ ] done so like check this place out I'm showing you this uh this one that's at Bandon beach so wander has this location look how sick this is so all of their places are like this they're like just like pure it like looks like it's straight off of Pinterest or Instagram

a home but it shouldn't feel like homey right in the same way that like you don't want your meat to be gy right it's like you I kind of do like the luxury [ __ ] and that's why I like wander so if you're looking to travel check them out wanderer.com they have amazing properties I think two like 200 now these guys are growing really fast so they grew to like 200 locations in like 18 months or something insane well that's the plug that was a great plug yeah if we don't say so ourselves yeah that was a great plug wanderer.com check it out um Sean you've been gone for three and a half or four three and a half weeks now how you been two but who's counting um I'm good uh paternity leave is harder than working for sure so like couldn't wait to be done with it um I I have realized a few things about myself one thing I've realized is I love being an uncle and I love being a fun dad but to be the primary caretaker of kids is so hard and um whoever like you know whoever created this myth of like you stay at home with the kids and I'm gonna go do the work the greatest marketer of all time that is that is a great reframe of what's actually going on it is so much work to be at home with kids but it's great everybody's healthy everybody's happy so I'm feeling good did you do any work over the last uh since your kid was born not really no just a few uh few voice notes and there did you enjoy that no like I told you I am uh again like I did other work it's just work that's like you know more like changing diapers and like you know cleaning up spit up but did you enjoy like lack of screen or lack of thinking about uh like business yeah so one thing I did do is I shifted to um doing a lot more creative stuff so I uh so I read a lot more which I normally don't read because I feel pretty unproductive if in the middle of the day I'm just like yeah I'm going to just take couple hours and just curl up on this couch and read a book that seems completely um unproductive even though for my my my job my life actually can be that actually can be really productive for what I do but I've I just have a guilt when I do that so in this I had no guilt I uh like start playing the piano again which was like just like a fun thing I could do with my kids so I'm playing the piano I'm swimming with my kids all the time I'm uh you know reading books I started um working on some like comedy stuff that I'd always wanted to do like just dabbling and like oh how would I do this I went and saw uh a standup show I went and saw a play like just stuff I wasn't doing before that was very much more in a like art creativity mindset versus productivity did you go by yourself no no I took my mom to the comedy show and I um went to the play with some friends the play is actually pretty interesting have you seen or heard about the Leman Brothers play I saw you share it yeah I think that I mean sounded awesome I've never heard of it other than your share so I feel I wish there was more of these things this is really cool so there's a Broadway play that's basically the Leman brother story and what I thought it is I thought it's going to be the 08 crash I thought it's gonna be the big short but as a play and I was like oh great big short as a play I'm in but that's not at all what it is it's basically the story of the leem brother it ends like it's the the play ends the first day of the of the crash like it doesn't even show the crash it's like implied you already know what happens with the crash it's the hundreds of years before that of how Leman Brothers even became to be one of the four biggest like investment banks in the country and it's a pretty wild play because there's only three actors in the entire play it's three and a half hours long which is way too long to be honest um but these actors are super talented they basically carry this thing for three and a half hours and it's also pretty fascinating because I did not know this history and it's kind of like reading a biography but as a play and when I watched it I was pretty inspired I was like I wish there was more business entertainment like this like I am really into things like this I could if I was this interested in the Leman brother story which I was not curious about before I feel like there could be a hundred times more content like this and I'm kind of inspired to try to go I think that would be the greatest pivot ever not quite pivot I think you should 100% explore this I think that would be awesome I am I am exploring this not not only as a player I'm not sure if it plays the exact form factor but something more in this style of content not tweet newsletter podcast YouTube I think the whole world tweet newsletter podcast YouTube and I'm just like I feel lame doing it whereas if I did something like this like a grand creative act I think it would be a lot more fulfilling a lot higher risk too what's the play called the Leman Brothers Trilogy I think and who wrote it and like did you research uh yeah I started looking into them and I started trying to figure out like how successful is this thing and I started doing the thing right I'm counting the seats like during you know one of the two intermissions of the of the play cuz it's and half hours long they have two intermissions I'm trying to figure out like how successful is this thing and how long has it been running and all that stuff so's what's the background I'm looking at I'm trying to look it up now there's not it's not too not many people have written about it I think it like started in London and then it's kind of like fanned out from there so this was opening night in the uh San Francisco location that I went to and to be honest there was a lot of empty seats but I also didn't understand because when I went to buy tickets there was like no tickets available so I think either they screwed up their ticketing system or I don't know why half the seats were empty but yeah anyways the point is I think there should be more like this and I kind of want to create it I'm also slightly intimidated because I'm like I really have no idea where I would start never done anything like this um and so which is a good feeling to be in because I know the answer is well you just start putting one foot in front of the other and like today it's it's the Moy quote that I've shared 100 times on this podcast which is today I know nothing about deodorant but in six months I'll know everything there is to know about deodorant and that's how I would have to approach this because I know nothing about this have you ever read the story about Sylvester Salone and Rocky he was a nobody and he wanted to make this movie and he wrote the screenplay no the story is even better than that he did not want to write a movie he wanted to be an actor that's right and he goes to auditions and he keeps getting turned down and they're like because I mean if you hear Sylvester Stallone talk like his voice is like his his mouth moves in a weird way his voice is sort of strange so he just kept getting Nos and instead of just taking the no and just saying well I guess I'm just not cut out for this he's like if they won't put me in a movie I'll put me in a movie which is one of the greatest like big dog moves anybody could ever have right like what's the opposite of no small boy stuff is to say if they won't cast me I'll cast myself and he hates writing so he's he's never written a movie before and he actually hates writing he's not good at it but he uh the best part of the story is that he just ratchets up the intensity to level 12 so he's he decides I don't know how to do this so I'll just why don't I just not come out of this house until I've written this the play or the the the the start the screenplay and so he's he wakes up he's like I'm going to start writing I'm not going to do anything else I will not leave this house until this is done that's the only way I know I could force myself to get through the thing I don't like to do which is writing how long did it take him and he he goes even further he Paints the windows black he's like not only will I not leave my house I don't even want to be able to look out the window so he literally painted his windows black and so this has become a phrase that I use with Ben a lot which is yo let's paint the windows black on this which is how do you have a phrase for what means to turn the intensity knob up all the way where it breaks and you're just holding the knob and now the intensity is stuck at level 12 and that's paint in the windows black and so then in three days he wrote the the V1 of the script of Rocky he then then it's even better the story is actually like I I don't know all the details but here's like the the rough version of the story I apologize if I get something wrong he goes to to sell to to like get the movie made now and actually they like it they're like we like this and he's like awesome and I'm Rocky they're like not that part we like it but you're not Rocky and they're like what he's like no I'm Rocky that's why I wrote this thing and I think they were like you know you could do this other role he's like no way give me my script back and they're like look look we'll give you $200,000 they they offered him 300 Grand which is the equivalent of a million bucks today and he said he goes I had $106 in my bank account in the bank account he turns it down things are pretty rough he ends up selling his dog to like make ends meat what a dick what a dick he sells his but I think he also couldn't like afford to feed the dog also because he could couldn't really afford to feed himself either so he sells his dog you gonna sell your kid hundreds of bucks he then goes and he finally get he finally I think sells a thing for 25 Grand or something like way less than what he was going to get and he gets to be Rocky after Rocky comes out and it's a success he goes back buys the dog back for 35 Grand because the was like no I like this dog and he just like makes him an offer he can't refuse like I give you $35,000 for this dog back and that is the story of Rocky which is insane because the story of Rocky of how he got made is more inspiring than the actual story of Rocky in the movie and he wins an Oscar that maybe that's my first play It's the story of Sylvester Stallone riding Rocky that's a great idea and he goes to the Oscars they win the Oscars and he goes 10 months ago I was a valet driver I was parking cars I'm here at Oscars today this is a great story this is your story to the half a million people that are going to listen to this do not steal my goddamn idea we're leaving this in don't steal by idea that's actually the beauty of this No One's Gonna Steal by idea because Who the hell's gonna go try to make a play you turned me on to this guy on Twitter I don't know I think his name is Zach prod so Zach is this guy who's like he's like a 210 pound beef cake he's a big guy which means like if you look like a donkey you're not exactly going to think like this guy's going to be a good long distance Runner but turns out he likes running and he's run the marathon now under three hours which is like really fast particularly for someone who's that huge and he's got this whole stick called the year of obsession and he all he does is tweet out he goes he goes if like if I could I would just run and lift weights 24 hours a day I'm so sad I have to sleep like he tweets like crazy things out like that and it is a little cringe but I think it's more inspiring to be honest than it is cringe uh I actually think it's quite awesome I do think that crazy people like that are pretty cool um but he uh that's what your life needs to be over the next year the Year of obsession paint the windows black baby and his whole thing is he does a running club in New York City every Monday at 7:00 a.m. all these people uh meet and go for runs with them and he goes here's the rules you got to be at this place at 7: a.m. we're going to run this many miles and then we're going to Sprint afterwards and you must wear black and so his whole thing is everyone who's following him or who's like into this they put like a little black Emoji next to their name uh I think it's awesome that's what that's what you need to do you already wear the black t-shirts now you got to paint the windows black and you're going to write the Sylvester Salone uh story yeah that's really good by the way you said this thing run Club what's the deal with run clubs I feel like I'm getting my sign Feld on what's the deal with run clubs nowadays this is uh I saw this Tik Tok that really spoke to it this guy posts and he goes uh was there like a thing like did I miss something know the pandemic was pretty uh a pretty crazy time I was inside for a lot like did something happen where everybody started running he's like everybody I know runs now and that's cool running's good but where why did everybody decide to start running and like why are the run run clubs are like an insane thing now um have you been paying attention to this yeah I have and I'll explain to you what I think happened so basically there's this guy Nick bear we had Nick bear on the podcast um I don't think you've ever made it with Nick have you yeah maybe I did one with him yeah but then I tried to leave you you know it's kind of like when your roommate hangs a sock on the door I was like okay let me leave Sam alone with the beef like you guys can you guys can admire each other's nipples for the next an hour and a half that's cool I'll I'll just take the take the pot off Nick bear is a beef cake amongst beef cakes Nick bear is uh he looks like a he looks like if you like he's the wagu version of the obsession guy yeah if you were to like take a Greek statue and put it into a white guy who's raised in the midwest that it would look like Nick bear so Nick bear is this um he owns be nutrition it's a it's a supplement company but he has this stick called the hybrid athlete and the hybrid athlete basically means uh someone who likes to lift weights and run because typically Runners uh look like not great they look very skinny you could be skinny fat and a great Runner his whole deal was like I'm going to lift weights while I run he's been doing this for many many many years now at this point he's got one or two million followers on YouTube and I think he helped popularize this thing and so now a lot of these young men uh who like to lift weights they're saying I actually want to go running as well and so they've made it popular to go running and it's also a very social thing so in Austin run clubs have been getting very very popular and so on the trail that I go and walk on or ride my bike or run you see tons of groups of Runners and it's very popular and you're starting to see Pop Up In other cities in fact the woman who runs uh my little project Sam's list she used to work for a company that was trying to make money on R run clubs I think that's a stupid idea because I think it's incredibly challenging to make money off that but it's a cool idea that they exist cool guys start running right influencers so uh have you seen this one in Austin called The Raw Dog Run Club no that sounds awesome the braining is it's a run Club beautifully done branding is amazing so go to instagram.com rawog DWG here's the profile raw dog Austin Texas sexy faces and sexy Paces Saturdays at 8: a. location post is weekly open all just show up I've seen this guy yeah look at the photos the photos of this it's Coachella it's laala palooza it's every Festival you've ever seen but they're just running instead of you know drinking and listening to music they made it really fun they made it sexi I I love The Branding of this this is kind of like the pinks window washing uh like branding level thing I've never done this and I would never do this because I hate running but I really respect the way these guys are building the community and the brand around this if you want to go down a kind of interesting branding and Community Rabbit Hole study these guys I think they're doing a lot of things right uh go look at their Tik toks go look at their Instagram go look at their website go look at everything that they're doing and I think that they are doing a lot of things well I also think that if I'm one of these influencers like a Cody Co or whoever I would 100% lean into making a national um like run Club where you know the way we're doing our MFM meetups which like to be honest we didn't do anything so we should take zero credit for this but the way that the community started self-organizing MFM meetups so that a bunch of like like-minded dreamers and schemers get together in some City and they hang out they get to learn about each other's businesses and it has nothing to do with us but like we were the we were the reason that they got together that they found each other but then from there on they had their own little Community which is really great um and by the way we should shout out I don't know what's the URL for that it's like get river.com or something I don't know if you want to go to a meet up you should do that I think that is one of notg river.com for sure that is something else Al together what is that it's called get river. I think I just opened up like only fans basically so um it's get river. and then if you go to the the website you'll see I think we're on the front page so you'll see it August 1st there's meetups in San Francisco Bay Area wherever right so the getting people together in real life for real life experience um off of your online community even though you're not there as the Creator I think it's a really smart move for whoever does that and whoever like you know if I'm Nick or if I'm codo if I'm one of these guys I'm gonna lean into that because it deepens people's kind of connection relationship with you and it creates this kind of Grassroots movement and if you end up you and you could end up building a business around that right because you could sell you know those products that people have what are those things like goo and like um what else like all the runner products right uh the electrolyte drinks by the way so the club that you're referring to Raw Dog they're based in Austin the guy who started it is they're all young kids so you look like they're 23 24 25 he actually works for Nick bear uh and so and he's a former professional bodybuilder uh and so it is sort of rooted in that and in this like 20 people who have kind of started this thing there's another good example so we talked to Jesse it's he didn't tell us too much information but do you know this thing called Jesse ller started a company with this other guy and the other guy recently joined Hampton and that's how I got to talk to him it's the the name of the business is the height of Mount Everest so it's 29 29,029 I don't know if you pronounced 29029 I don't know how you exactly pronounce it but it's a they do eight figures a year in revenue and what they do is they have got these events all over the country and they pick a really tall Hill or mountain and you climb up that short Mountain as many times as takes to equal Mount Everest and so it's like the whole shtick is like you can climb Mount Everest or at least the height without actually having to go uh to Asia and do that and it's a great company these guys do really well and they have I think they have hundreds for sure dozens of events throughout the year and it's one of the uh events that I've seen that's killed it and I've always been interested in these racing events and so like for example Iron Man right before Co happened Iron Man was was acquired by a Chinese uh billionaire and they've tried to make make it significantly larger uh and I think they've done a good job of of that and so some of these events are actually really fascinating have you heard of this other one called the uh uh I think it's called the country Marathon have you ever no sorry maybe it's called The Rock and Roll Marathon but anyway what it was is in Nashville they had this where for 26 miles every mile they had a band play and so it was called like is it called like the rock and roll rock rock and roll running series I see yeah and I believe that business was acquired for nine figures and it started as a kind of small Niche thing where they had music every uh every Mile and so there are actually some of these really interesting uh endurance events businesses where they just have one cute stick on it and that makes it kind of cool uh there's another one called the speed project have you seen the speed project so the speed project they don't listen to this the speed project doesn't have a website you can find it on Instagram but it's uh invite only and so the race has I think only one rule or two rules the race has two rules they start at the Santa Monica pier and you either you by yourself or you with a four-person crew have to make it to Las Vegas and the rules are basically you can go there any way you want but you have to be running so you can't get in a car you have to run the whole time and number two you just got to get there and so you could take any route uh there's and and there's no website other than you have to be invited to do it they don't really to really announce when it's going to happen and it's gone VI whenever it happens every year it kind of goes viral where you see like a handful of influencers who you like they're like what is this speed project why are they there right it's super fascinating uh my friend did it and got second I have two things to say about this number one if you're the type of person that likes to do these and you're like world class at organizing these hit me up so sean.com I have a a small Google doc of ideas that I thought would make for a really awesome event that would be like just fun and awesome if it existed but I I will never do the work myself of organizing these um the second thing is what is the pickle ball of running I'll let you do on that so what I mean by that is pickle ball took tennis made it faster cheaper smaller more accessible to all ages and all sizes of people right um what who's going to do that for running so who can make running less of a marathon or an Iron Man likeit the other direction who's gonna shrink it into like it might just be sprints like maybe sprinting is more like pick ball I was I was a sprinter in college there's no Sprint events for grown men and sprinting is way better for you anyway hamstring insurance is needed for sure if you're going to put adults in like hey just come out come out here and Sprint but I do think that there's got to be something like this or I we made this joke on the on the Pod where I was at a dinner and this guy goes yeah I um he goes we goes yeah every Saturday morning we walk the trail uh we walk a mile we uh to our favorite like kind of brunch spot we drink a beer and then we play play pickle ball for an hour or something like that and he's like I called it the um like the Suburban uh the subur the Suburban Iron Man and I was like holy [ __ ] he's got something here with this branding of like the bourbon like the the Suburban you know Dad ver dadbod version of a of a fitness competition where it's more about the fun and just getting out there and doing something because I think in the jobs to be done of what's going on in these races you have many things that are being bundled you have the fitness component you have the social component I think a lot of these run clubs by the way have a big dating component because I think you want to meet people in a context where everybody's you know swxy you know sweaty and sexy and just you know everybody's it's like uh a positive vibes Community you g to talk to anybody approach anybody I think there's a dating component so you have the social you have the fitness you have the photo component which is how do I do something that I can brag about on social media right how can I go post something on social media that makes me feel better than the average person and that's how tough mutter and Spartan Race like that was huge for them so I think there's a bundle of things that you're getting out of these and then you know the last one is kind of like getting people out of the general feeling of softness in their life uh which is which is very real and I think only going more and more over time as we spend more and more time on our devices and AI goes in and makes our life even more you know everything you want at the touch of a button people still want something difficult physical to go do so I think you can unbundle part of that and make it maybe ramp up the social and put down the physical right or ramp up the photo and you know whatever so I think you can un unbundle that in a way so let me tell you something uh really quick and then we'll wrap up on the segment but Google hi I think you pronounce it high rocks so h y RX don't go to the website just click images so this guy I think his name is Christian he used to work for Iron Man the company Iron Man and about seven years ago he started this thing called high rocks and they have events throughout the year as well as a world championship the world championship just happened on Saturday oh I saw I just saw this on Twitter somebody was like these H Ro things kill and it was a like a photo that just looked massive in scale it's like a airplane hanger or something what is this thing so they rented out uh this year it was in Brooklyn so I imagine they rented out like a whole pier and the way it works is uh I I I think the event changes every time but I'm not exactly sure but basically they rent out this huge area and you have to do a series of five exercises in a row and the first person that wins wins the whole thing and so the exercises are something like uh lunges with a weight on your back and then it's rowing a certain amount of meters and then it's running a certain amount of Miles uh and then throwing like a a a weighted ball in the air like you got to like throw it in the air a bunch of times it's basically the my first muscle challenge but like real men and yeah and the winner did it in an hour which means I imagine the the race is an hour to three hours depending on how slow you are and if you look at the photos it's all people wearing all black and they're all smoking hot like everyone who does this is good-looking and so it's sort of like CrossFit but CrossFit kind of has a douchy component to it this somehow ton it down and they added like a New York all black Brooklyn like yeah swag to it and it's awesome so Lance Armstrong competed in it this uh this Saturday uh it's literally the Equinox version of CrossFit it's aesthetic of cross and I think they're killing it and this Ken R out who was a guest on our podcast uh uh a few times or once he uh I hung out with him recently he was like hey I'm going to be in New York I'm going to do this race he got third or fourth or something like that and I went and looked at the Instagram of the people who want it and it's their whole life so now they're like dedicating their life to this and so when you when I saw that I was like this business is going to be huge if people are like it's like a lot of ex uh a lot of EX College athletes who are like oh this is like an interesting Outlet where I can make a little bit of money and continue to train because I'm not good enough to like be a professional at whatever sport I was doing I think this business is is killing it and I think we're we're going to see a large exit from these guys very interesting man this is a it's a much bigger space than I would have guessed for sure and I think you're seeing a CO bounce so I don't know about you but as I work from home all day I'm normally I don't really like hanging out with people but I'm like I need someone to touch me like I just I like I need a man to put his arm on my back and ask how I'm doing or like you know what I mean like I feel like like I need need more touch and stuff and like dude if you're 22 years old and you're working remotely I feel really sorry for you that you don't get to experience some of this stuff that we got to experience and I feel sorry for myself frankly that I'm still not experiencing it and so as someone who doesn't like to go to these events I'm now I'm like I want to go meet people I need to go do this stuff I need to find my tribe so I think that's what's happening that's very cool uh yeah this is a great great segment um can I leave you with one interesting thing that happened to me in our catchup segment here I got a phone call the other day that kind of blows my mind and makes me I feel simultaneously grateful embarrassed and inspired and you might be wondering what could possibly make me grateful embarrassed and inspired at the same time here's what happen Scott Harrison calls me the other day and I see this voicemail from Scott Harrison Scott Harrison is the founder of Charity water he's been on the Pod once and he's an incredible guy I've told a story before but I'll I'll I'll leave that out for now he's definitely somebody in my like top five people I admire if you said which entrepreneurs do you admire I'd be like Scott Harrison is up there um the short version of why is the guy is using his entrepreneurial talents to kind of save the world in a way he's providing clean water to people who don't have it which once you see firsthand you feel like something's wrong in the world that people don't have clean water to to you know to drink or to bathe in or or sanitation all that he's been doing it for a long time he could be he could be making himself Rich some other way if he want wanted to but he decided to devote his life to this and he didn't the best part of why I admire him is because he didn't start that way right there's some people who they do amazing things and you're like H they're just sort of born Mother Teresa this guy was like a part right party boy you know he he's like I was living every deadly sin you could for a period of time for 10 year period of my life and he turned it he sort of decided to make a shift and and ended of doing this anyways here's the story Scott calls me I miss the call I call him back what's up do you need something is there something I can help with for charity water what's going on he's like hey man I'm listening to the podcast and I had some feedback for you I'm unsolicited feedback said sure hit me he said you want to do this right like you really like doing this yeah I love doing this and this is like your thing right you want to make this your thing absolutely I think I can be great at this you got to say like less o and I was like what here there you it again so I'm I tell him what do you mean he said I was listening to this episode that you guys did great episode but I think you said like 700 times and I'm like oh no he's right and he's like you know I used to do the same thing it's hard to get rid of but you can get rid of it and I wanted to tell you that I think you do it too much it doesn't add to what you're doing I think you could fix it and you will be better if you fix it and I just wanted to tell you that that and I was like man I had two thoughts I said first how do you get rid of this how do I improve that is it like you said that you improved it how did you do it was there some technique you did did you hire a coach what' you do and he's like don't worry about that it's just once it's in your awareness you'll fix it you're like I I am worried about it basically the answer was pay attention to it and you will obviously start to to start to reduce it and you'll you'll work on it that's all it'll just take reps the second thing I felt was dude thank you I'm not that close with Scott Harrison I like him I would consider him a friend but this was the first phone call in five years let's say right we don't talk that often so for him to do that the the courage and the care that it takes to call somebody and be like yo some feedback for you I thought that was an incredible friend moment and I was again simultaneously grateful embarrassed and inspired by it and since then I've been thinking about this how can I just call and insult people call people and just ruin their day no I'm playing but like hey [ __ ] I've been thinking about you uh you're uh you're only 5'5 uh we got to add a few inches to that dork radical cander out bye you're welcome no seriously that this is a gift he gave me a gift and I was thinking about this how many of those gift have I given people um very few very few I think it takes a lot of guts to do that I think it takes a lot of care to do that there's different ways to show somebody you care there's different ways to give you know an act of service for somebody and I was like this is one I can do and for the people in my life that I know like me would take it as a gift I'm going to do that of course I'm sure that it can go the other way where some people do not take it uh well dude Neville uh Neville madora my best buddy Neville does that to me all the time like he'll be like hey could you come over for a few minutes and yeah sure and I'll go over he goes hey so last Friday night do you need something he's like no you do come over well like he goes last Friday night I had a party over and this one woman brought her parents there and you did not let the mom talk nearly enough you you're you were kind of uh talking over her and I think it made you look really dumb and I don't think you are dumb he has done that to me so many times uh that's one example another example I stayed at his house and I didn't make his bed right he goes let me show you how to be a better guest in someone home did you see how I had that bed made cuz I really care I need you to make it this way come let's make it together I'm going to show you how to do it and that's what I expect you he does it all the time that is amazing also kind of kind of big Dody there I like that uh but well he older than me he is kind of like an older brother to me I've always looked up to him but he's done like when I was like 25 I think uh I had a t he stayed at my house and I had a towel that smelled like Milo and he goes and I gave it to him to use and he goes come here Sam let me show you something this is is that how you treat guests like and it's always really helpful he's always said that to me and I think it's great but I will say I know you say like a lot I kind of like it to be honest oh no I'm getting feedback whiplashed out wait is this my thing maybe it's my thing we should do a charity thing with him uh we should do we should do some you weren't on that podcast when we did one so we did one where I no but we should do like a proper campaign like uh just the way we did my first muscle we should do something whether it's that one anyway we should when we did uh we've done a few things where we were kind of charitable but not really and whenever we do those it's like the right thing to do and it feels good we we got to do we got to do a little uh a little give back thing and I'll post an update of the one that we already did uh which was it went to the campaign went to India so we provided clean water and Wells to to people in India and I think we raised like something like 50,000 so I want to provide an update of like what happened with that the impact which is what one of the key innovations that Scott had with his charity he was like no he was not like he decided to uh change the way the Charities work he's like I give to I give money to Charities but I never hear back from them like I don't know what happens with with the money and then they just come back again the next year and they say can we have more money he wanted to have like a closed loop so that when you donate you actually get to see where the money goes what impact it had you get to see the photos he literally installed like little Google donated these like um iot devices these flow meters so that you can see that the well you help build you can go in the app and you could literally see how much waterers flowing through that well right now and so he did a lot of experiments like that to like change the feeling people get when they give where they actually get to feel the impact because his belief was If people could see how much good it does they they would do more and he was totally right that's is why charity water has raised so much money um all right is that the pod that's it that's the pod [Music]

how is it possible that .1% of the population owns almost 70% of all the motels in America a small number of motels a few thousand of them came into the United States in the early 70s the refugees they would buy these motels and basically fire all the staff motels are labor intensive the family can do all the work and move in into two of the rooms because they had no costs they were able to charge nightly rates that were lower than all the neighboring motels as their nephew came of age they would help him out to buy his own motel and then the next one the next one you run this for 50 years you end up with 70% of the motels in the country under Patel ownership

my job as a Founder it's to inject risk into the business you can get away with certain things that other people simply can't because you own the damn [Music] place all right today's episode we're going to talk about things that interest us one thing that I tweeted out the other day I wasn't surprised by this result but it still made me sad I tweeted out I said if you could guarantee a 7 a half% real return for the rest of your life every year guaranteed but you can't invest in any individual stocks forever however you can start your own business and I think I even said you can but you can only invest $10,000 into that business or you can invest actively you can't really buy the index but you can invest actively and do whatever you want some days maybe or some years maybe you'll get plus 50% some years you're going to get minus 50% which would you choose option A or B 40% of my 300,000 followers selected option b and you replied and you said option A all day easy what why did you select that well to get 7 7.5% like with no effort and you're guaranteed it's a no-brainer it's an absolute no-brainer for me I mean um now I've got a business I have a lot of risk in my own business so that might be part of it as well like I don't I have all the risk there so let me ask you this were you intending this to be like someone who's 21 years old straight out of school never invested before has nothing else going on or is it just like at any point in your life I think at any point in your life that's still the right decision I still turn that switch on in a second yeah that's a ridiculous return uh in a good way uh and a consistent return I mean the way that would compound over time would be fantastic and there's nothing boring about that that's an incredible I mean it's boring actually but also an incredible thing so yeah would you think that the the the survey was going to produce did you were you surprised by The Ratio or I'm surprised that the average Joe I mean and my followers are probably above the average showe in terms of income maybe IQ maybe not I don't know but for they're they're typically a higher good looks for sure they're they're up there they're very goodl looking it's a very high like I would imagine it's a high educated castal uh crowd and and so anyway I I I would have thought that they would have seen the fallacy that they probably can't beat all the others particularly the other people who have a much better advantage and so the idea that although everyone else fails at getting this return I in my little office in part-time with just me can somehow beat all the others and I and I thought that that was shocking to me that that they thought that they were exceptional at that that's what I was surprised at yeah well that's pretty common I think everyone thinks they're exceptional in some way I mean the thing people don't take in into consideration is is is uh is risk so like they they might go well if I just buy Nvidia or apple or whatever Shopify I mean and the thing is in the short term you almost certainly can over the next two or three years you get lucky pick one pick a winner but the rest of your life that's the question so here's what I've done lately I've been spending time in New York because I've got family here and I cold emailed and did cold Outreach I randomly met a bunch of people who work at hedge funds and I'm like hey like I'm not like a competitor you don't ever have to worry about me I'm just like a a passionate interesting uh interested person can I just like see your office and just like can I just sit at your computer and you just show me your software and like I just want to see like what you do all day and you go to some of these offices and you know I would have thought like they were like Wolf of Wall Street where it's like buzzing and like the phones are ringing it's really just a bunch it's pretty quiet and it's usually just like a bunch of nerds like looking at a computer screen but they got like four screens and they've got like incredibly complicated software and the average show is getting paid hundreds of thousands sometimes tens of millions of dollars to be good at this one thing and then I think about like how is like Bobby Lee in whatever Missouri where I'm from on his Robin Hood app possibly GNA have like an edge on all these resources and these people with all these resources they're still not that good you know I talked to a guy who worked at Bridgewater recently and I was like bridgew I've read up raid doio aren't you guys like the best he's like sometimes we're the best but the last 15 years we've sucked we've underperformed the market and I'm like that's insane that 1500 employees tens of billions or hundreds of billions under assets you all paid like the best there is you still can't beat it and so that kind of like that's kind of where I'm coming from yeah it's also like Vegas you go to Vegas and you know you you're on a hot streak for for 30 minutes and you know the longer you play the less you're going to win you're going to lose like that you're going to lose the house is going to win over the long term so people I think have this idea of short-term performance in the market feeling like I can I can do this forever just like in Vegas you can't do that forever and you will begin to lose and the same thing is true in the market so yeah lock it in what's this thing about loosening the grip on the stick oh yeah so I got I got a drum set recently I I used to kind of want to play drums I kind of did for a little bit I stopped for many years and I kind of just picked it up recently my office is a bit of a mess so I got to find better place for but right now it's in the corner and as I've been playing I I I been I learned this very quick lesson um and actually it's true when I try to learn how to play guitar I say try again because I'm I'm not very good at these things but I I enjoy them is when you're new at something you tend to hold things too tightly like I I hold the drumstick too tightly I hold the neck of the guitar too tightly anyone who's played any instrument will understand kind of where I'm getting where I'm coming from here I used to play drums I know what you're talking about okay so you you hold the stick really really hard and then you fatigue faster you don't have as much articulation on the stick you can't get certain ghost notes and tones out of things because you're always hitting too hard and too firmly and you just there's no finesse and it kind of dawned on me recently that um this is very very true for most things in life I think especially business I kind of some ways I feel silly always bringing this back to business anyway I realized that like by simply loosening my grip a bit by lightening up um you end up having better control you end up playing better you end up working better you can do it longer um and you allow other things to happen that weren't possible when you're gripping so tightly I think this is true for business I think when you're starting a business you have a really tight grip on things typically and it's best at some point to loosen up a little bit and let the rest of the organization expand into itself versus you trying to control every last thing and I run into a lot of entrepreneurs who I think have not learned how to let go of the stick I think that that's also a young man's thing to do right like you learn this with age what are you saying what what you what are you trying to say well what I'm saying is you you have a couple decades of uh of experience and and like and so do I and I think that as I'm getting older which I'm not old but neither are you I'm learning it is okay to loosen up that's what they say a lot about uh men they say oh well he used to be intense but he's mellowed out he's mellowed out and that's usually what they're referring to yes that's a good point yeah the mellowing out um it's nice though in in a different realm of something to to find a metaphor and in my head now I am kind of thinking about this like loosen like loosen up your grip a little bit and what parts of life well I'd say business I would say also like with my kids a little bit I I I would say there's a way where I I kind of wanted wanted them to do certain things a certain way and I and it just it it creates this conflict like they're their own people I'm my own person um and you know I want to encourage them to do certain things in a certain way but I also got to loosen up a little bit around that and let them find their own way um and that that's something I kind of learned pretty early in parenting um uh so there's there's a lot of things but I just in general I just feel better when I'm not gripping things so so tightly and um when I look out there uh you know on on Twitter or or anywhere LinkedIn or whatever and I'm I'm looking at these like business stories there's just I'm I'm reading a lot of grip I'm reading a lot of tension uh that that you know people are trying to op over optimize and paying attention to every last little thing in a way where I feel like just loosen up a little bit like pay attention to a few things that matter and let let it let things just be a little bit more all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we've give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copyrighting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show the best example that I've experienced this in my real life is arguing with people and so before it was like every word that I like what I learned to talk it was like it was fight was the first was the first thing that came out you know like my early words were I wanted to fight and so if I met someone with a different political uh perspective it was you're wrong for these reasons that you're really stupid for that um when I lived in San Francisco I I was it was I was significantly more combative than I am nowadays as I uh I've been lucky that I was raised in Missouri and that I um lived in San Francisco lived in New York lived in Texas and that has shaped me a bit politically but also that it it bleeds to other points of life which is like instead of someone saying something when someone says something that I disagree with it's more so instead of fighting it's uh well why do you feel that way uh that that's that's a really interesting perspective tell me more about why you feel that way and I think I I don't know if this is just a clickbait thing but Kiana Reeves had this quote where he was like I used to argue with people now I never argue you could say one plus one equals 5 and I'll say well I hope you have a really good day um and and that's a little bit about how how it's been where I I just want to argue a bit less and I I'll still catch myself arguing but uh Dale Carnegie in this book how to win influence to how to INF Win Friends and Influence People he's got many famous lines but one of the famous teachings is basically just don't argue with people because you no party typically walks away happy or satisfied and so loosening the grit for me is arguing less where it's I'm not even going to judge you and I'm just gonna I can recognize that you think this way and I think this way and it's cool it's a great example actually uh I hadn't thought about that but that that's another great example of just like holding on it's not even holding on too tightly to a perspective because you you can have a perspective that you really believe in but it's it's it's you know it's like don't clench where you're not even able to listen you know I think the the point about like being too uh grippy is is you're you're you're it's like you're a spring under tension and if someone says something to you that you disagree with like you're going to Boom expand and like explode right which is kind of what an argument can be versus just already taking some of the tension out of that spring and just like bouncing with it listening versus exploding out of it I think that's a big difference have you ever read there's there's this term I'll have to figure out what the term is but there's this term where astronauts go to space and they see the Earth from far away and many of them have reported to have a lifechanging perspective where they think to themselves the fact that we're fighting over religion is ridiculous the fact that we're fighting over borders is ridiculous now let's Zoom down to the smaller things the fact that we're fighting over someone saying something rude to us is absolutely crazy because we're all just a bunch of monkeys on this like floating thing and it's like monkeys with cars we are yeah and we see like this this abyss and then we're just this silly blue thing in the middle of it and and and it's like a lot of astronauts say it changes their perspective and it Mellows them out and I think that when I read about that years ago it kind of helped me calm down a little bit more to where you think not this the stuff that I thought mattered doesn't matter for example I remember when Co happened and I was like we're never going to a concert ever again and then three years later I'm like [ __ ] that I forgot all about that do you know what I mean totally have you have you uh to that point about astronauts have you um read that great passage from Carl Sean the pale blue dot what's he say no I mean it's one of the most beautiful I'm not going to say it because I want you to read it I want you to have the experience of read it's short it's a paragraph it is one of the most beautiful passages I've ever read but it's it's exactly kind of what you were talking about with the astronauts like looking back at the Earth it's all about all the things that have ever happened I'm going to really generalize here cuz I want you to read the words but all the things that have ever happened every leader every religion every point of view every argument every whatever right beautifully in beautiful Pros happened on this Speck of dust basically I think he calls it like a moat of dust it's such a beautiful passage and it brings tears to my eyes and I try to read it a few times a year because it's so right it's so spoton right and it's exactly what you're talking about in the most beautiful poetic way which is all the stuff that we're worried about all these things like very few of those things matter although of course they matter in your day-to-day life so like they're real for you but they really don't matter that much and it's just a good reminder that you know all the things we're just so fired up about who cares well it's a it's a paradox of like caring by not caring um why do you not like comparing this up to business and I'll afterwards I'll tell you my reason why I think it's good yes so this is an undeveloped thought of mind that's been sort of on my mind and I don't know if it's a good idea or not so just run with me here I'm gonna I'm going to kind of this is undeveloped it seems like every great lesson is then applied to business by someone so for example a Navy SEAL learns all the stuff in the military and they come and they like then consult for companies about how to like run teams or some great coach coach is a great team and then they come and they bring it to the business world it's always like bringing it to the business world and I'm like what does the business World deserve the best lessons from things that are completely unrelated in many ways to business but why does it always come to the business world and the main reason is why in my opinion is because the business World pays for that advice it's not that it deserves the advice it's not even that it's advice that's applicable but that it pays for the advice and the way I've been thinking about it is not as this this this this shining beacon on a hill that business deserves all the greatest things but actually as the drain that all these ideas drain down through business because business sort of just is willing to pay for it uh and and listen to it and sort of have this this this um it's sort of insecure in a way so like it's it wants to listen to the Navy Seals it wants to listen to the great double or n NCAA coach it wants to listen because it it's insecure in its own way um and also there's this there's a sense of like um these other places and people they know better than us so we're going to we're going to just you know bow down for their advice and I don't again this is a little bit unformed but it's something that just bugs me a little bit I don't know does that make any sense or is it is it is this a weird idea no it makes sense but my argument would be instead of the image that you've had you've just painted is you've painted a upside down triangle with all of this beautiful stuff draining down into this bad thing thank I would turn that turn that upside down and say it all is going up to this amazing thing and here's why because I think that whether you like capitalism or don't like capitalism you cannot deny that it's here to stay at worst it's here to stay in the lifetime of everyone who's alive maybe America will change maybe maybe the rest of the the majority of the world will change but I I I wouldn't bet on that happening anytime soon therefore I think that capitalism and thus business building is the most practical way to manifest a dream or a reality and often times you could say well what about art and I would agree with that but at the end of the day you're still making stuff that people want and you're still selling tickets you're still trying to make some type of money off of your art so you can continue doing it or you're just going to have a rich person who funds you so you are are able to do it and so my opinion business is the most practical way to actually kick a dent in the world or to manifest a vision and so I think of business as a very P like I'm very passionate about it being a little bit of a spiritual journey of like turning dreams into reality that's an optimistic point of view which which I I do understand here's my question if this thing called business is absorbing all of these lessons from all of these other Realms right and they're all like either filtering down or filtering up but they're filtering too and maybe I'm wrong about this but why aren't the Navy Seals asking CEOs for advice sometimes they are if you look at like I don't maybe they are like uh Jack Welsh's book Six Sigma like a lot of different types of organizations outside of business like view that book I don't really like that book but they view it as like the rules of the game yeah okay yeah I might be uninformed in in a sense of like what who the military is listening to and who you know sports teams are but there's something it's like you would imagine this this this entity this business thing that has absorbed everything would then be the definitive source of this wisdom but I wonder is it a one-way Street or is it a two-way street and it seems I think you're more right than you are wrong that's for sure it's definitely more one way yeah no I just wanted to give I just wanted to give one example but I was frankly that's a nitpick example totally I I don't I don't know again I don't know if this is a good idea or not it's just it's been sort of floating in my head for a bit so I it's fun to air these things out what was more fun early days or late days of the company oh man that's a really good question um they're very fun in very different ways so I me it's a bit of a cop out but it's it's true um but they're fun in different ways what's exciting about the early days is there's a certain energy that you can never capture again which is the the there's so much more unknown like you're you're you're go you're starting from zero and you're building something and you don't know where going to be and where it's going to go and what's possible and what isn't and how long it's going to last and all those things now you don't know how long it's ever going to last in a sense but there's this there's this hope there's this possibility there's this birth and you know it's like boom we're out in the world and here we are and this is an incredible thing and that's super fun and then you get a lot of new attention and you're kind of burst on the scene and that's exciting really exciting um I think what's what's hard actually is the middle we've gotten to a place now being having done this for 25 years it's become really fun again in a different way but I would say like 15 years in is a different story uh because that at that point it's like we've been doing this for a while I don't know how much longer it's going to last like you're kind of in this sort of Maintenance thing um were you big enough at at 15 years where you're like like payroll is not an issue like were you out of like any type of uh uh outside pressure where it was like things are fine I so it's like I feel weird that I have I'm complaining but this feels weird yeah and I'm I'm not really complaining about it but yeah yeah it's more like you know Scott SC Scott bsky wrote a book called the messy middle yeah I have not read the book actually but I understand the idea of it and it's kind of what I'm trying to get at which is like the middle of it is it's like what do we want to be now and and where do we want to go now and are we going to be a big company are we going to stay a small company there's all these opportunities that are surrounding us now and swirling around us versus when you're starting you're just like you're just going you're just moving then you get to this play place where like kind of evaluating and now we're in this place where we're just sort of mellowed in a sense to your point although we're actually getting very ambitious again because we have the sense of like we've been doing this so long now that like if we took some crazy bets or made play some crazy bets and it just totally all fell apart like I don't want that to happen but I'd be okay with that too like we're at the place where it's like we've done plenty and we've had an incredible run and if it all ended with a bang because we tried some crazy stuff that didn't work like I'd be okay with that too so I feel like I'm at that place now where I wouldn't have been at 15 years that makes any sense what's your sense I mean you started a bunch of stuff my sense is that um so none of my things have have been as big as yours but they've been big enough where we've had dozens or you know 50 60 employees and it it we got outside of the like existential crisis moment where it's like things are working my and everyone talks about focus focus is a very common thing and it's something I I firmly believe in but as someone who likes to make things for my skill set a company outside like maybe let's say 3 million in revenue or maybe maybe five million in Revenue I've noticed consistently a five million in revenue and like 15 employees something like that I'm like I don't know what to do with my hands like I'm just sitting here like what how do what do I do I feel useless and I feel like uh sometimes a general behind the scenes just pointing and I've noticed something that I I I really dislike but I think it's normal is a company es and flows and I've noticed that this EB and flow carries over to the rest of my life where uh I just had a child and I'm like I'm in this uh quiet time for a moment where I have to be present whereas there's other times where you're dating or something like that and you're like I'm in I'm I'm in war mode a little bit where it's like there's it's action constantly or like I'm on top of my game and I got to be on top of my game same with business where it's like we're launching this new thing we're we're out fighting uh with the troops we're in the trenches and then there's other times sometimes this I think can last for years maybe where it's just like we're just doing the same thing over and over and over again and that period can be a little depressing even though everything is going well it's a very saddening period because you lack action uh it's basically like what they say with a lot of great investors uh I think uh uh Manish said this on our uh uh paba on our last podcast he was like if you can watch paint dry you're going to be a good investor the problem with that for a lot of in uh a lot of entrepreneurs or a lot of like go-getters is that's a really sad place to be in even though everything is going well it's really uncomfortable to be in that feeling and so have have you guys had a lot of have you had a lot where you're like man I just got to kind of unfortunately have to do nothing for maybe years yeah I can totally identify with that and I think I think what you're getting at is with entrepreneurs is that what you're describing is in the early days you are very important as founder yeah then there's a point where you build an organization and then the organization is able to in some ways in a good way run without you to some degree and at that point you kind of feel a little bit less valuable yeah to your own thing that you made it's a good thing but for you it's a good thing because it means there's some stability and you're not the bottleneck and you're not the only person that matters here anymore obviously but but for you personally it feels a little bit like you've become detached from this thing that you made and you you're now further away typically from like the the the creation phase and now you're more in the maintenance phase of something and and you're dealing with internal politics and personalities and hiring and you've got some great people who just left and now you got to find new people and the culture is changing and like that's a pretty tumultuous turbulent time for a founder and I've gone through that many times um and it it it comes comes and it goes what I found is that what I kind of discovered actually recently is that my job as the founder I'm still a Founder I still started this company I'm still in it 25 years my job as a Founder what I've realized is is it's to inject risk into the business most people Everyone pretty much at your company's job is to manage risk to some degree to keep their job to not push too hard or too far ultimately um you can get away with certain things that other people simply can't because you own the damn place you are the original person so what I found a lot more joy and and um and excitement in is is revisiting this idea of injecting risk and for us that means and by the way I I don't think you could change that I think like for a long time I was like why aren't these people taking risks I got to force them and I'm like it's impossible that's impossible to change even if you hire a great great CEO to replace you as CEO like they're they just don't have that they they might be Inc an incredible see CEO great executive executing things trains are on time incredible but there's that thing that's present in a Founder simply because they were there from the beginning that they they have an extra ounce of it's not even that they're they're not better than they just have an extra ounce of latitude that allows them to take risks that nobody's going to say no to maybe if you have a board maybe someone's going to say no but they'll still give you more latitude than a Hired Hand basically in a sense so my my sense is the way I found to return to this sort of Flow versus the the ab is like is to inject more risk which for us means we're going to build a lot more products like this year we're going to do four products we're going to we're going to begin we we're about to start working on two products simultaneously which we've never done before um we've never built two things at the same time and like this there's a lot of stuff going on we got different models we got once we got SFS we got all these things we're going to do multiple versions of multiple things and different different business models and we're we're going to we're really off balance in a really healthy way at the moment um because like we're doing a bunch of new stuff and that gets me excited now it makes some people internally nervous understandably so it's like well this is different now we're kind of off balance a little bit and we're trying new things but that's how I have to run the business um otherwise I will become bored and at that point um it won't serve me or the business well if I'm in charge and board that that's not a good good that's not a good thing for my professional life or for my main company that's like the main 9-to-5 thing um for Hampton I've not I do inject rist but I have a CEO and so uh I try to I have to like respect uh I got to respect that relationship and so yes on my nights and weekends I um I created a new website for fun I created this website called samslist it's samslist doco nice and the reason I did it was I tweeted out like who's got an accountant that they love because I just needed an accountant for something I got like 300 replies and I was like wait something's interesting here because this tweet got so many bookmarks like a lot of people bookmarked it and someone was like oh I'm saving this for later to find an accountant so I was like this is interesting so I spent a few months calling every accountant on the list finding out how much they charged what services they provide what services they don't provide who the ideal client is who isn't the ideal client whatever and then I created a website called Sam's list where I reviewed or I uh like put all the information from all my research for all these accountants created this website I think I got 8,000 people to come in the first week and then I uh started figuring out how to monetize it and so this month the first month that's been live it's May 22nd when we're filming this I think it's done 20,000 this month and the $20,000 that I've made from that is more dopamine than let's say a million dollars a month or two million a month that I've gotten from other things it's a total rush and I love it why is it why do you think that why do you think that's so exciting for you it's a total rush because what started it's so fun it's so fun for things that start as silly jokes like uh like just stupid like the calcul like the the logo that we have is a calculator that has three numbers and a Q and it looks like clippy it looks like clippy from Microsoft like waving at you it looks like Mickey Mouse and I just used chat gbt I said make a logo that looks like clippy but it's a calculator and it's so fun to take silly jokey stuff and turn it into real things that actually solve problems and I find that to be almost like part trolling part like [ __ ] eating grin like scheming like I love that like isn't it would it be hilarious if we made this a thing and then actually seeing it become a thing I find to be so exciting uh I also think that when you're when you have a idea even if it's like a serious idea and you start seeing customers truly like it that's a very invigorating feeling it's the best and we we have this internal saying we don't say it that much we we I've said it before and we kind of try to feel it which is that cool wears off but useful never does and what you've made is something that's useful and that is one of the most beautiful things I think you can do for Humanity is to make something useful um and and to have fun with it and to screw around and not like take it so seriously this is going back to thing your your grip is loose on this you know you're having fun with it you ask chat GPT to make a logo and you're goofing around the name is just your name it's like it's just have some fun and and it's a reminder that that's what this should always feel like as much as possible it is totally valuable to do hard things absolutely but not everything should be hard there should be plenty of easy things in your life too things that flow things that you have fun doing things that don't feel hard you don't need to pile up and collect only hard things and so while some of your business ideas might be harder to pull off for other reasons this one is so light-hearted and easy it's healthy it's good for you and you ReDiscover like why you do this sort of stuff and it's also fun I think there's something probably I'm guessing there's something probably in this that like you're like I did this by myself yeah that's like the feeling of accomplishment and go I you know I can still I can still do something by myself like really by myself and that's useful is is is very rewarding and and hard to come by sometimes when we all think we need to have partners and co-founders and teams and stuff to pull things off do you and your partner get along like beautifully we get along really well we're not like we're we're friends but we don't see each other very often we live in the same town and we don't see each other I see them once every I don't know couple months we're very good partners um and we're friendly but we just don't we don't hang out like our families don't hang out um not that we wouldn't enjoy it we just like we just don't there was um there was a a study where they looked at uh the most common uh reasons why couples get divorced the most common reason was contempt and the most common the most common reason for divorce was contempt the most common reason for staying together was you admir the other person ah I hadn't heard that but it resonates like resentment is just bad and I think a lot of business partners resent each other actually have you you've been in business with others I'm assuming yeah I've got uh the most I've had bad relationships I I'm currently in a very harmonious relationship with my co-founder Joe that I could see lasting a lifetime what feels different about it so when we first started together we uh we we invested in startups together and we had a great time and he previously helped me with uh my old company the hustle I cold emailed them and he was like Hey if you're in New York tomorrow just stop by the office and we could talk and I was like yeah I'll be there and I like flew out there and like hung out with them and uh that's how we became friends and then we invested in startups together and then I was like I took like a really formal conversation with them I was like Joe I love working with you um something I did with my wife early in our relationship when we were like thinking like hey is this something that we want to like make real and like get married and have a family and I sat down with my wife and I was like let's just like walk through our life values and like what type of Life do we want to have and let's see if like they kind of align and that's okay if things change eventually but let's just say let's just see if the direction is is is similar and so I sat down with Joe and we said uh hey let's just outline like what sacrifices are you willing to make what sacrifices are you not willing to make what's a perfect day look like for you what are you driven by and like for example for me I was like you know I'm driven by ego like I it bothers me that people think I'm not good enough so like I always want to prove that I'm uh as good as I think I am or I'm driven by money uh I was like I work only 40 hours a week I don't really want to work more than that um I'm not willing to sacrifice traveling um I'm not I'm not going to like get out of my house often if I have a family and he like named all of his things and we looked at the all the things and we're like how much money do you want to have how much money do I want to have we looked at all of the things and we're like uh for everything that is agreed upon awesome for everything that's not agreed upon do we think that that's like a deal breaker and we they weren't and we were like cool we like did a really good job of being very honest upfront about our wishes and now it's much easier to address like any issues we have because it's like hey you uh he'll be like hey we got to get this done and I was like Yeah but I but but he'll be like uh but you told me that you don't want to like grind on a Saturday so I'm not even going to ask you it's all good we we agreed to this uh things like that and that makes the relationship really nice um is that we uh respect one another and we had those conversations super early on do you feel like uh um the list or the conversations you had about that um turn out to be true like are those really the things that that that you guys share together or is that sort of what you imagine iMed you would share yeah for example for for the money let's just do the money one that's a really easy one we actually shared each other's personal finances with each other and interesting yeah we were like super transparent we're like here's all of our finances uh what matter like I would like to go here one day where would you like to go it's like all right well to go there we're going to need like let's say that my goal is less than your goal let's hit your goal then and if we need to hit your goal here's maybe what the numbers would need to look like and here's what we'd have to make so like that you know is that like something we both agree upon do you know what I mean like we were very transparent with each other that's wild I mean this is I know you and I were talking on Twitter a little bit about like how I'm super uncomfortable talking about money and you're like sharing your personal finances with your founder and kind of it's it's interesting you don't do that with your partner you don't do that you don't do that with your partner like well you guys your guys' finances are probably so tied together but you know they are tied together I mean yeah basically all of our you know essentially the vast majority of our net worth is tied into our business so we know what our distributions are and all that stuff but yeah we don't I we don't talk about that ever um but um it's interesting like I also like you're midwesterner I'm a Midwestern like I I feel like my my thing is like don't talk about it I don't know why like it's ingrained in me were you were you like that a one point or and did you change or I was always open about it because I saw my family like that and I was like that's so unhelpful for me because you're not telling me you're not giving me a road map you're not I don't have anything to strive for because I don't even know what's possible my father owned a produce brokerage company which like uh it's like a small business but they sell like let's just say over the course of his 30 or 20 year career he sold like a $150 Million worth of onions but like I'm like how much is a lot of Buddy is a lot of Buddy like 50 Grand a year or like $300,000 a year like I I have no I have no clue about this and so I and I always regretted that that they weren't open with me so I was like I'm just GNA be open about it it's so interesting my my folks never talked about money I don't still to this day don't know if they're middle class wealthy I don't I don't really know you're kidding me do you really you have no idea that's weird do you support them I have supported them I I gave them a big chunk of money at one point but um they they like regretfully took it they didn't really want it um then I don't think they need it and I think I'm going to get it back when they pass kind of thing like they're not going to use it you know they've always been very frugal um we don't talk about it my dad was an entrepreneur worked for himself like a small business owner he was a Trader so he traded stocks on own uh he wasn't a broke I think he started out as a broker for a little bit but then he was on his own individual investor basically I think he did well for a while I think he didn't do well for a while I think you know that's that's a tough road in a lot of ways um he wasn't a day trader but there wasn't anything we couldn't have but we also didn't strive for anything that we couldn't afford it just I don't really know parents have always been careful with this so I I kind of absorbed that like just don't really talk about it and um it didn't limit me though it's not like I I just felt like we we were everything was sort of fine as how it felt to me what are you going to do with your what are you going to do with your kids I struggle with this um like my parents never really talked about it we we don't talk about it but we certainly act differently than I than my parents that growing up you know we own a few homes um you know we've a couple nice things you know so it's like it's it's it's kind of obvious that like we can afford things um and do things um but uh we just don't we haven't talked about it I think that's that's an incredibly Midwestern and a incredibly uh more traditional older set of values um my family had very Midwestern values and I think a lot of those values are great hard work don't complain um don't don't make people work for you like uh like I remember going to like a restaurant and like we ordered a pizza and they brought us like a chicken salad and I'm like yeah we're not going to we're not going to inconvenience you whatever just give me it uh like I will eat that exactly yeah that's like ude I've never sent a dish back in my life not a million years steal whatever it's fun yeah and so like I actually think some of those values are great I think there's many other values that are like I don't like using this word because it's too loaded but toxic bad uh there are a lot of values that are bad for example I think the stoicism that midwesterners tend to have that you definitely have I think that it's gotten you to where you want it to go in a traditional success uh perspective but also like not being trans parent with certain people I think I just don't want my family to be left wanting more when I'm gone in the sense of like I wish that they were more open with me for example I've not seen photos of my family really when they were younger or like I don't have any your parents you mean yeah my parents when my parents were younger I'm like and I don't even know their grandparents' name I don't know I had to do 23 in me cuz I'm like when I asked them what my Heritage was they would just go we're white I'm like yeah yeah okay but what flavor like come on I need some more and so or or I had to do ancestry.com in order to understand like who my grandparents were like what are you guys hiding and I turns out I found out that an uncle is actually uh my grandmother was married previously and I'm like why didn't you guys tell me this and they're like oh we didn't want to bring it up you know like little things like little things like that and I'm like that's weird just like just discuss it just just tell me yeah yeah that's weird uh so anyway I think that is actually bad though and I pray that I don't fall into that into that trap and so that's why with my family I've been overly transparent with a lot of things uh and I just think that that like lightens lightens things up a little bit I admire that actually and and this is something I actually also admire about David um I'm sure you wouldn't mind me telling you this um David used to when we were in Chicago uh when we had an office he used to drive to work in like incredibly fancy cars yeah and my Midwestern sensibility is like dude don't do that he's like why not like my sense was like it just it sends a weird message and he's like he's like what's the message I mean everyone knows like everyone here who works like they know we're doing well like why why would I hide that from I agree with you on that one by the way um and and I I I it's so funny because he's right I think have you seen the big Labowski he goes you're not wrong dude you're just an [ __ ] so like in my mind I'm like I but I still struggle with it just because of how I was raised and how I was brought up and and and and and the imagined messages like the whole point is like I'm imagining that everyone's looking at that and going what an [ __ ] what it's like most people probably don't care they don't care they know this they know the score they're fine with it and if they're not that's their problem like David's point is like if they have a problem with me driving a nice car that's their problem it's not my problem like I've earned this I enjoy this car I buy this car because I I like the car I'm not going to hide the car and he's he's right but I I just have a hard time with it still not anym with with him this is like way back in the early early years um but but it still is something that's in there there's a residual like struggle with that degree of honesty around money in a similar way that people like you know iner like who'd you vote for like I don't talk about who I voted I think Chris Rock has a great bit on that it's it's so funny um like when I see someone with a with a political bumper sticker on their car I'm like you're insane you're you're a crazy person yeah and they're probably like why I like this guy I like that guy I like her like what why why am I have do I have to hide my point of view and they're right too you know so deep down your point of view is healthier I still have a hard time with it not and that's probably my problem or may maybe it's not I don't really know I don't really know it's very interesting do you want to change or do not care well I think the truth is my kids have a or at least my son who's older my daughter's five she doesn't recognize any of the stuff yet but my son does and my son's really into like he seems to be into expensive things he like has this craving for expensive things so I mean he he's got to know what's going on to some degree he's not an idiot um do I want to sit him down and go hey son we've got this and we've got that and like I that isn't how I would handle it it'd be more like I've worked hard here's what we have we have some things we're going to enjoy these things we share these things with friends this is not just our stuff um and that's kind of how how I how I treat for example the house thing when I renovate a nice old house and and I make it better like it's our house but it's also all of our friends house they free people are free to stay there as much as they want visit as much as they want I have this property in Wisconsin This Old farmh House 160 Acres it's beautiful piece of land I've been working on it for years my friends use it more than I use it I don't use it anymore I'm not even around there my friends can just go up there whenever they want and use it so it's it's about like we're fortunate clearly fortunate and lucky and a big part of this is you want to share these things this there's there's you're not fortunate if you hoard the things then there's something I think kind of wrong about it in from my point of view so share as much as you can share these experience with other people and uh and and we're fortunate you know that's kind of how I sort of left it at this point I don't know we'll see um the the thing that I tell my uh friends and family um is I try to let them know I don't I and this is something that I couldn't grasp earlier on in my career I refused to admit this one thing which was luck is real and it has played such an important part of any type of financial uh uh like just meeting the woman who you spend your life with like just the fact that we are in the same place at the same time luck is such a bigger component than I ever would have been willing to admit years ago and I think and I think that what I'll explain to my children is like look I worked hard but I frankly didn't work harder than many other people that's right I'm smart but I'm not that much smarter if at all than the average person the truth is is that I worked hard I had a skill but I got like 50% of luck was like was like part of that or maybe even more than 50% luck is such a hug huge component and I hope that I can uh put that on my family to realize that luck was real it just happened to work out uh because some timing thing worked out like let's say you started a business and you surged during covid you're like dude I just kicked ass cuz something I had nothing which I did our business killed it during Co I'm like I didn't know that was going to happen that was just total luck or you know what I mean like things like that it's it's absolutely real and I need and I hope my family will understand that 100% with you and I think it's way more than 50% I mean all the way back to you didn't choose your parents you didn't choose anything right you didn't choose your mind um how' you become the kind of person who is the way you are like there's a million inputs a billion inputs that you don't know about all the things one of the I don't regrets too strong a word but one of the things I regret most most in my career is getting on stage at startup school so this is like um y combinator startup school years ago I forget when I was invited to speak I was only invited once because I was pretty anti- raising money yeah I was say I thought I thought you're like the opposite of their ethos I was but uh Paul was kind enough to ask me to come up on stage and and give a talk but you and Paul seem quite similar to be honest well I appreciate that I mean I I have a lot of admiration for his ability to to put is together and and think things through what he's built um but he invited me on stage and there was a question from the audience about luck someone's like do you believe in luck I'm like hell no I don't believe in luck wow like and I was such a prick how old were you early mid 20s mid 20s I think it was whenever it was and I was just such a prick but a young punk prick you know kind of like and and it's so embarrassing but you know like a lot of things are you look back on like poetry you wrote in college like oh my God I wrote that or whatever like whatever it is you know and and and you know it's like you just realize like that's part of growing up is is is totally misunderstanding the world and your position in it and then hopefully hopefully uh you get to the place in your in in your in your world where you're you develop a bit more and you have some self-reflection and you can call yourself out on the [ __ ] that that you that you thought but also like that's who you were at the time and that's that's that um last thing I wanted to ask you about was this staying off versus staying up you said imagine all all the things you felt you were falling behind on if you didn't learn about them last year would it really have mattered if you started today instead watch out for the Trap of must know now what's that mean right now this is like in the AI World we're in right now every once in a while like in my for you uh feed and Twitter it's like 10 things you got to know or you're falling behind it's like this this's just like this everyone's falling behind meanwhile this thing is brand new and moving faster than any human can can pay attention like I just keep seeing these stories about like if you don't know this and they're doing that and if you're not on top of this it's like no probably doesn't matter that much um and all the things that if you would have read that feed a year ago that you were supposed to know uh it wouldn't have mattered that much if you didn't um most things uh some things would be handy to know but like it probably wouldn't have matter that much if you started now instead or waited a year in some cases one of the things I was doing for a while I'm not doing anymore but I should go back to doing it again this was actually easier to do during the pandemic was to go back and so so today is is is May 22nd 2024 is to go back and all the podcasts I listen to and listen to May 22nd 2023 so listen to podcasts that are a year old and during the pandemic it was great because you hear all these experts talking about this and talking about that and everyone's so certain of everything and you go back and listen you're like man we are so wrong about so many things and so many of the things we were worried about never happened anyway in this political issue and that political issue and if this guy gets in office this is going to happen if they get in office this is going to happen turns out very very few things actually happen and it's really a nice exercise to go back and listen to Old podcasts and old interviews of substance and realize that like there's some stuff that was right some stuff that was wrong but man the the sense of urgency in these podcasts is is so misplaced because most things don't need to happen right now you don't need to be up on this right now and you shouldn't feel bad about not being on The Cutting Edge of X Y or Z especially an edge that is recutting itself and resharpening itself every few months so that's what I'm saying I I try to stay a bit out of things I don't want to be on the edge of things i' like let things settle in a little bit more before I really start to dig in do you read any biographies a few I've read a few um I I really love the idea biographies I have a hard time reading long books yeah um and most biographies tend to be very long I've got like a limit where it's like 500 pages or less um uh yes but I I'll do long but I'll do a long one every once in a while but and I read a fair bit not because I'm in a competition it's just an hour a night is typically a book a week and um I read a lot of biographies I I like business biographies I love history so like a lot of the World War II leaders uh a lot of the American like Titans of Industry um a lot of just random people I I love biographies and I have this process of what I do I've got this um spreadsheet where if I I only read on Kindle and anytime I see something interesting I highlight it and at the end of the book I'll like insert I'll create a timeline uh here's where they were born here's where they uh died and then anything that I highlighted that happened in this year that happened in this year and then what I do is I go to this website called newspapers.com newspapers.com has archived pretty much every newspaper ever back back until like the 1600s and what I like to do is let's say um I read this biography about uh Ted Turner Ted Turner is the guy who started CNN he was a fascinating guy to me or let's actually biggest land owner in the United States bigest yeah and he's done a lot of fascinating things and the reason why I use newspapers.com is I like to go back to my Kindle and my spreadsheet and I see all right in this year he decided that he wanted to buy land you know I'm going to go read a newspaper article that wrote about about him during that period And I want to see what he said about his interests why he's doing it and like did he say it like for example uh maybe he'll say like one day I hope to own like 5,000 Acres turns out he owns millions and millions and millions of acres and so I like to read what the predictions were as well as what the people were saying about the person at the time so you don't get revisionist history and what you notice when you do this is there's often times that you'll read uh a biography and you'll think this was obvious that this person was going to do this or they're OB who wouldn't have predicted that this was going to happen and or here's another example uh World War II Church Hill was like basically he was like the the world's going to end like we are G to Die the world's over uh we felt that way during covid but if you read a lot of history there's been many times where we have felt this exact same feeling and we had this exact same prediction you know I remember I I recently read JFK's book and like with the Missile Crisis it was like the world's over and I go to newspaper.com and I'll go and read what the predictions are and what you notice is that people are wrong more than they're right is it and so what you're saying about things moving too fast I I I I read uh Henry Ford's biography about cars um or Henry Ford's biography and I so I got interested in cars and I went and read like what people were saying in 1912 when the Model T was coming out and like the predictions are just ridiculous and it's so funny that you don't to to reiterate on your point you don't actually have to be that fast to pounce on certain things uh it's really quite fascinating and to put this in perspective the Ford came out with the Model T I think in 1912 or 1916 so the internet right now is something like 30 years old uh so that is basically like how old would you say the internet is or like the modern day internet the the the commercial internet yeah like 95 96 is when like you know really Mozilla or Netscape kind of came out really kind of made it happen it's basically basically it's older than that cuz it's a research thing but yeah commercially yeah 35 years let's say it's basically like a car company in 1940 uh do you know what I mean yeah yeah yeah and so what's really fascinating is to like read all these biographies and use newspaper.com it's one of my favorite things to use and to see what are interesting uh predictions and how have they come true because I already know the answer but I want to know what were they saying at the time and so that's my version of what you do with 2023 is podcasts love that that's I didn't know that site existed too that that's fascinating it there's um a a an ex account I follow called like pessimists archive or something like that I love that one it's a it's a great one to follow and just you know like and the thing is the thing that's a little bit interesting about right now the time we're in is that um there's so many people saying so many things all wearing the expert uniform some people are experts like there are experts in this world but many people act and play as one based B on just their ability to communicate on platforms and uh there's just so much um certainty uh layered into their suggestions and requirements and requests and demands that it's just it's very healthy to go every time you see that every time there's like a you must I I always back up and go probably not like the more forward they are about being certain and right about something sort of the less interested I am in the short term and I'd rather just sort of stand back and see how it plays out and at the end of the day um uh you know there's there's plenty of opportunity in a lot of different areas you don't need to just pounce on everything as it's happening um and in many cases it's it's best to wait a little bit and see how things settle out I mean I just think about like with AI like all the companies that began to implement AI stuff early on uh and and then open AI just like wiped them out in a lot of ways for a lot of different reasons and when you build on other people's platforms you're very very much um at risk of things changing tectonic plates shifting very quickly you might have been better off waiting and seeing how things shake out so anyway who knows I wanted you to come on here and just talk because I've read your work for years I've been a fan of yours for years I've seen you do a bunch of interviews and I just wanted someone told me uh this guy named Dylan just said you should just ask people what's interesting to them and that's what I wanted to do uh with you because you're an interesting person and I respect your opinion on so many things and so I appreciate you just coming on and just riffing with me and just telling me what what's intriguing to you and it's been a lot of it's been very valuable for me just to see how you think and what what grabs your attention well thanks for the invitation it was it was really fun and and as I mentioned earlier I just I want to make useful things and hopefully this is a useful conversation for for us and for anyone listening so thanks thanks for inviting me and it was a real pleasure all right that's the pod [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
yeah actually call him right now and put on speaker phone yo Preston you're live on the podcast right now what's going [Music] on all right we're live Sean I've got a weird thing for you do remember like 12 months ago I told you about Craig Fuller you know who Craig Fuller is yeah he's a uh Freight waves right yeah so Freight waves it's a data product for people I guess who are freight brokers something like that and they're pretty big uh for some reason if you go they run their company like they're publicly traded in that you can Google them and see all their revenue and profit and so I don't know the exact numbers but you guys can just Google a freight waves revenue and they put out like quarterly statements which is interesting but it's like a large like 60 or80 million a year software business or or subscription Data Business anyway Craig is an interesting entrepreneur and I told you about how he bought this thing called flying magazine and what he did was he uh was a big fan of flying and he's Wealthy on paper but I don't know how wealthy is liquid and so I think this was like a big deal for him but he bought flying magazine and then he also bought a $7 million like 300 acre plot of land in Tennessee and was turning that into basically a flying Club where you it's kind of like a country club where you like can own a home on a golf course except now you own it around an airplane strip and an airplane hanger and they used the magazine to to sell plots of land it was like a neighborhood and basically they were like you can buy a house it's going to be it's you know the middle of this neighborhood is basically the airst strip so we're going to be able to take off if you if you like you know either flying your own plane or private private flights and so they were like we're GNA that's the vision that's the Field of Dreams we're going to start doing this and I think it was working extremely well I have an update I will tell you how it's going so Craig has now acquired 30 sorry 44 different magazines and they are going to do roughly $50 million this year with 18% iida and it's his prediction by 2030 this side business that he started he says I think we can get to a billion dollars in Revenue with 30% profit margins and so that's an update on this guy what he's doing and he tweeted out recently his quarterly Revenue I think last quarter Q4 of 2024 was 15 million in revenue and he's doing it profitably and here's what he does so he finds an old title like an old magazine where it's around a expensive hobby so I think he has a boating one he's got uh I think he is even looking at like RC planes and RC cars and things like that so where there's an expensive Hobby and he uses this thing that he calls negative CAC meaning people pay for the magazine and so that is how he acquires a customer of course they are paying for the magazine not him trying to advertise to get the the user and then he goes I want to create Commerce products to sell to the audience and so the media businesses pay for the company they pay for the audience creations and then they help bootstrap other businesses that I can sell to this audience and at this point he's buying companies for three to five times IA which is I think that's pretty cheap but it's a dying it's a dying medium so maybe that's not that cheap it does require some sophistication in order to like turn them around but it's really fascinating that he's pulling this off and is his side like his side hustle this is his side business his main business is Freight waves well a couple questions so he bought this personally not it's not a part of freight waves no it's its own thing so that's why I said it was like kind of a big deal for him because I don't know Craig's personal situation but I don't think he sold any of freight waves other than taking on Venture Capital to build the company this is wildly impressive so first of all it's called fir Crown so Fir crown.com and you could go to their brand section you can see all the things that they bought fir Crown great name they've got 44 Brands you're right basically it's a bunch of things about private flight it's a bunch of things about boating and sailing and fishing and yachting and wakeboarding and then there's things like classic toy trains Garden Railways trains.com and then some uh like astronomy stuff as well looks like so this is a lot of things that he he rolled up he must have found a a kind of repeatable rinse and repeat model it says here that he buys them for 3 to 5x e but as his typical range and was he using debt was he using revenue from the business what what was he or cash flows from the business how was he buying these I think he got a bunch of friends to invest but I don't know exactly he's going to come on the podt I asked him to come on to explain his strategy but what he did was there's a bunch of companies that own tons and tons of magazine titles so uh Meredith Corporation owns owns like Martha Stewart magazine and then I think there's like Rodell rodale and then there's Bonner and there's all these companies that are like old family companies that have been in business since the 30s or 40s whatever and they've got these Publications that are just sitting there and they're like uh just take them um and and so he could buy them like five or 10 at a time or you know I think he's tweeted out that he's bought like 13 the other day and so he buys them in bulk a little bit I mean this is super impressive the the side hustle that's Now 50 million 50 million a year profitable really really specific uh you know expensive hobby magazines and then basically has a better business model sounds like right so it sounds like the old business model was it's a media business so we make money on the media he's like no no it's a media business so we're going to use media to acquire customers for a much more valuable business model uh you know for example with the flying thing you know they're selling these homes on this plot of land for like a couple million bucks each so I think you said what 7even million bucks to buy that that 300 acre plot land something like that yeah so roughly you know uh let's even round it up 10 million bucks to buy the thing but then they're selling each home at two million bucks they sold 50 homes right you know just rough numbers I don't know how many they sold but they sold enough that it's worthwhile and it's a beautiful place uh piece of land and on flying magazine they're also if you follow Preston Holland he's the CEO of flying magazine yeah he's brokering Jets he's selling Jets he's like yeah on Twitter he goes we've got this jet for sale it's $7 million he's a good dude we text all the time and I'm like he almost gets me to buy a plane like I'm like dude you stay away from me man you I'm not going to buy a plane just cuz you uh you know you've made a funny joke in this day dude Nick Nick Huber I'm going to do this is a Hampton plug Nick Huber and and Craig are in the same Hampton group they bought a plane they bought a plane together and so they now Nick owns a plane I guess they like I don't know how you buy a plane together they did it but they but Preston's selling these like 10 million jets online it's or on Twitter it's crazy Nick shared the economics of buying these small planes by the way uh we should we should ask him for permission to to share the numbers like we bought it for X here's how much it costs to do each flight here's how the rules work because it's kind of a time share it's like him and six other guys or whatever bought the plane and um and so you pay for like the P the pilot and the fuel when you need it but then you just pay like an ongoing basis but then you got this tax benefit of buying a plane and so how how how does it what does it all work out to what does the cost per flight ultimately work out to he's he's shared the numbers with me before so we should uh we should do a segment on here talking about that but isn't this crazy that this is this guy's side thing and how amazing it is it's pretty sounds like it's about to be his main thing is what I'm hearing well what's crazy here's kind of a takeaway which is all right so most people couldn't imagine this being their main thing when you get into business like him and you have some success uh with Freight waves and you start seeing like how things work it's like you get these like weird like unlocking moments where you don't see certain things as risk so I've never bought a business before I see buying a business I'm like that's really risky but he's like no like I've done it enough times that I know how to unlock value and I don't think this is risky because we're going to do this this this and this and it really is a Confidence Game as much as it is a knowledge game uh but it's pretty amazing how he's been able to pull this off I'm super impressed by this this is one of my favorite kind of like uh businesses that you brought to the to the Pod to the people's attention and uh really really impressive what he's done so where do you think this goes what what do you think he's going to do and what does he do for the Boating ones like is he doing the same thing he's selling boats or what is he doing to make the business work out of those I don't know I mean know yet I don't think he knows yet I'm not sure he hasn't shared it publicly but I guess you could do similar things where you have a marina I mean have you ever like know like my parents used to have boats and I know that they they would spend like 500 to ,000 a month on a on a boat slip rental and it become it became a community where we would hang out and stuff like that I I something like that I'm not sure what he's going to do selling boats I mean I'm not sure how he's going to pull it off but there's like plenty of options all right everyone really quick if you've heard this podcast before you know that Sean and I think that the most important skill set you need in business is copyrighting and so what we did was we went through all of the podcasts that we've done it's like 500 of them and we found all the best copyrighting tips our resources our Frameworks are templates we aggregated all of them into one simple document so you can skim it all and get everything that we've ever talked about with copyrighting it's in the link below it's awesome check it out should we uh call this Preston guy right now just get him on here to uh to explain this yeah actually call him right now and put on speaker phone yo Preston you're live on the podcast right now what's going on dude we are talking about flying and we're talking about fir crown and I'm blown away I didn't know about fire Crown I only knew about flying and Sam is telling me about the the growth of this thing I got two questions for you uh number one when you guys started this was this the plan or you guys sort of stumbled into oh wow this might be bigger and better than we thought so when crank called me in 2021 it was a li style side help basically side hustle he's like hey you want to come out we run this I asked him I was like why you buy a magazine you know I can't tell last time I read a magazine and uh he was like well it's just gonna be kind of like a side hobby freightways is really my business but you know keep it small and uh but if you if you know anything about Craig as a person he can't he that's not in his nature so all of a sudden it you know we started rolling stuff up as we saw opportunities and you know now it's bull up into I me we're 257 employees the side hustle has 250 employees all right amazing and um tell can you can you give a little bit of the a peak of the because Sam has a bunch of the numbers of fire Crown because I think Craig tweeted out but can you talk about the thing you guys did where you basically bought the the land and then you started building a neighborhood on top of it so really what we did was we let content inform uh the commercial decisions that we made right so we an idea to kind of build an airport we're like that'd be cool uh you know we there's it's hard to find hanger space around Chattanooga and so you know as we're looking around I always tell myself that too where's the where's the hanger space in Chattanooga yeah right exactly well so we've got three airports and each of them have a weight list of like seven to 10 years long and so we're like well I guess we're gonna have to build a airport if we're going to be able to get hanger space for any airplanes you know that we get on demo or whatever build we we wanted to build a a a media center on a Runway and you know every airport was like yeah good luck uh it's going to take at least 10 years so we said hey let's build our own Runway if we build a Runway we should you know do something unique these flying communities are interesting and we started writing about it and realized that like there really high performing content like user you know from a from a Google analytics standpoint it's like you know we could see the the content being engaged with like okay people actually care about this they care about air Parks so we said okay well let's let's go ahead and let's build an air Park we announced it bought the land 1500 Acres uh about 45 minutes outside of chattano Tennessee and through advertising in our own magazine and said all right well this will probably be like a five to seven year project before we get started uh you know kind of underwriting and we had we we basically met our three-year kind of performa in pre- reservations in like the first three months so we like all right there's there's definitely demand here and so uh so yeah so we're set to break ground we just finished uh some regulatory stuff that the government loves to tell you where water should go and so we just finished that and uh are said to break ground probably here in the next 30 days can you give us a sense of the numbers uh what can you share on the numbers so like you know how much you guys buy the land for how'd you finance this whole like big construction Endeavor yeah sure so the uh we bought the acreage around $1,500 15005 in uh an acre um so it was it was really cheap land it's also in an opportunity zone so there's a lot of tax incentives for making investments in that area um and then we are we've taken $25 million of pre- deposits so that's people basically sending us a percentage of the deposit you basically funded it through the pre the the deposits kind of like how Tesla does with the trucks and all that before they before they build the trucks they they take the deposits and they use that to to basically Finance the the manufacturing now if you if you've got those deposits it's it prod to the banks you can go to the bank and basically say okay look we've got you know $25 million of of these launs pre-sold so like you know that represents future cash flows of25 million and they say oh okay so let's say you know using round numbers let's say round one of infrastructure costs I don't know 10 or5 million the bank's going to go okay well you've got $25 million represented of of future sales um so that you know 10 to 15 million of phase one infrastructure is a super lowrisk bet for them nice and then are you guys um bootstrapped or did you raise money to to buy all these magazines how did you do it yeah so we have we've been really fortunate you know since we've got some private Capital behind us um if patient which is really key right it's not Venture it's uh it's more you know patient Capital that says okay you know we're going to take a 15E time Horizon 20 year 30y year time Horizon um and then actually go and grows things we we got some Capital behind us but we didn't have to go raise you know venture or you know private Equity or anything like that that's kind of you know we don't have a ticking time basically we don't have a ticking time bom waiting for us to sell in seven or 10 years that a hundred valuation is the you know you talked about the Google analytics is this actually a print business or is it it's a online you know a media site a Blog that has print as like a vanity piece which which one what is the business actually so when we buy these when we buy these media assets um what we have to do is we go in and and it really is a shift in mindset and the shift in product velocity at a lot of these companies we are we tend to buy print magazines that happen to have a website where it's like okay we take our print content and then we post it online uh and so you know when when you go in and you acquire these you kind of have to you know kind of level set with everybody and say look you know digital is its own product um and it's gonna you know we we split out the pnls right so digital has its own p&l and print has its own pnl and we make p we we make print a product as opposed to the The Core Business if that Mak sense got um so it's like and and the other thing here's the other thing and it's and look we came in you know Craig and I day one we're like all right we're killing print because like and I don't know Sean Sam I don't know if you guys have a lot of print magazines but like I didn't I don't have I don't have a lot of print magazine subscriptions that's just you know not I'm 30 years old like I you know that's not how I consume media and so you know we went in to shut down print but there's something about being in print and Neil vogle talks about this at- Meredith as well that he's had a similar experience so it's not you know this is not a unique perspective like we're not the only ones that are thinking this but there's something about having a long a feeling of longevity and a perception of longevity in having a print product whether that's with advertisers or it's with audience or readers that you just don't get with a Blog you don't it doesn't feel and and you know you think about a brand like dwell uh is a great example like they have a print magazine and it for some reason feels more legitimate than architectural blog xyz.com right because it has a magazine so it's like we we use it as kind of a staying power but you know we also recognize that like the world's going too short yeah you also mentioned you like you leave the you you hustled your way to get the magazine in every like private Charter plane right just to get get the right rich people to be reading the thing you like left it on the table in in those planes is that right yeah exactly so we we send them un non-solicited uh to a lot of fpos across the country some are solicited you know there's about 1,800 or so that are solicited that we've got an agreement with the Distribution Company uh but the other ones are not solicited but they they feel like we've created a product that has so much value that they feel as though it's something that they want to display on the tables as people go and pick them up and I mean we've had conversations with you know some pretty wild folks that were like oh yeah I was in the FBO and I read your magazine and I want to collaborate on your real estate project and so it's like okay like how do you how do you quantify like an Roi on that like you know hard to like do last touch attribution except for like oh yeah you read about our project in our magazine that we put in the FBO and now we have you know really cool Partners uh you know on the real estate project gotcha well pressing you're the man this is a crazy business thanks for uh the on the on the spot call in yeah man long time listener first time caller so to be here first first ever caller we've ever had yeah first ever caller actually all right man take care see you man that was awesome all right we changed the show um that was cool I like them all right well I mean we got our information that's awesome congratulations to Craig and Preston I'm happy that he was transparent yeah really cool uh all right what else we got you got one you got one yeah let me do one okay let's stick to the print let's stick to the print idea uh but take a different angle so the New York Times the New York Times when you think about it you think this prestigious newspaper it's all about the news they'll they want you to think it's all about the truth that's their marketing the New York Times has more in common with Zinga that it does the truth the New York Times is a games company and um this this is the the numbers behind the New York Times and their gaming products is pretty amazing so I don't know do you ever play their games I I'm a like a pay subscriber to their games well I know they have wle and I played that one they bought wle um the guy had made like the guy like made wle for his girlfriend or something like that then it took off and then they ended up buying it but like I have a 22 days 22 day streak going right now on the crossroad puzzle on the mini crossword and how much you pay I think it's like $6.99 a month or something like that and what's the revenue on that take a guess $100 million uh a lot more than that so the New York Times just in Q4 their digital only subscribers was 289 million which is almost all their games it's a little bit of their cooking product as well but it's like mostly their games revenue and so that's 300 million in the quarter uh their their uh gaming basically has pushed their annual subscriptions over a billion dollars a year for the first time ever and they released this that was basically like the New York Times bundle so you have the news you have their cooking section their cooking product you have the athletic which is their Sports the sports thing they bought and then you have games so take a look at that that chart right there you could see that games you know few years ago few years ago games was roughly 15% of time spent now it's over 50% of the time spent in their bundle is on the games product which is pretty wild it's more time spent on games than on news it has overtaken news and so you have this thing that is um just fascinating it was like you know they used to in the newspaper have a little crossword section A little sidoku section and what they did was as they transformed the product they unbundled it they made it a standalone thing and what's cool about it is almost every game on my phone is just trying to like it's like needy is that how do I take all of your time and all of your money and the New York Times thing is works way different it's you have one a day there's one mini cross word a day one cross a day and one um you know one Wordle a day you do that every day every day me and my daughter do it together we play world together and then I do the crossw word on my own the crossword the mini crossword literally takes under one minute like my average time is probably 57 seconds to finish this thing it's a very short game and so I'm able to like play a game and have that dopamine hit without it like taking away from my life by being like oh great now I'm hours on this hey baby what's the it starts with an E what's the disease that brought down Chipotle in 2009 oh you're right Ebola that's it yeah well she plays r with me and uh she gets to type and then I come up with the words and um and so you know these the games are really fun it's a really well done app and it's shocking to me how successful this thing has been and so I wanted to just read you a couple things so it says basically a few years ago the time spun-off cooking crossword offerings to sandalon products meaning you could subscribe to either without being a New York Times new subscriber seemed like an OD choice because the internet already had millions of games and millions of free recipe apps but what they did was they just digitized Decades of old crossword puzzles and old cooking recipes that they already had so it's this kind of like Remnant inventory that they weren't using and they took that stranded asset and they turned it into like a viable asset a live asset and then they just like modernized this they put it in an app they made it like work really well and um super simple app and it basically Breathe new life into the company the company has has grown like crazy so now there's like over one now between crossword and cooking check this graph out should we just start calling the New York Times a gaming company yeah exactly yeah you guys Le those great games and you got like a sick blog that you talk about like the Trump trial I love that too side hustle yeah I love that little blog you guys got going they have over and this was in 2020 so this is years ago they had 1.3 million paying subscribers that paid on average you know $40 plus a year on the on the games and cooking product which is mostly games and they're not alone so that so that's New York Times then I saw um you know I opened up the YouTube app I don't do you use the YouTube app because I opened it up and I saw something very only use that yeah did you see their new games product look at this if I open up YouTube these are games and it says play now and you don't have to download anything right so it's like I click play and now I'm just I'm gonna be in this game and this is a popular mobile game this uh this thing called States um it's like a little like Risk type of game and and so they have like 20 of these games it says instant games no no downloads so YouTube's doing it now and then LinkedIn the other day announced LinkedIn games have three three games on top of LinkedIn there's like a Wordle variant there's like a whatever there's like they they took popular games that just kind of made their remix of it and if anybody needs engagement like real engagement it's LinkedIn right linkedin's got a billion users and you know but like there's not a lot of good content on on LinkedIn to do but this is cool because they basically made it where they have their sodoku they have their trivia they have their word game and basically you can you can see how other people in your company do so it's like they already have the social graph of who's in your company and who are you connected to so when you play the game you could see how you compare to people you already know because they already have that social layer built in of like you know kind of competing amongst your who do you think they stole this from cuz like imagine imagine like um the the meeting where they're bring this up it's like uh hey Sharon you got any ideas uh what if we uh call it LinkedIn influencers and we get famous people to post ah been there done that and then this other person is like hey Charlie what do you got what if we just put like Risk in the feed of LinkedIn you know what I mean like how would you justify doing that so I don't know if they acquired a company that was doing this or if they um or if there was just like I imagine some product manager that looks like he's just got back from n and he's like I had an idea and I got it through I got the I got the I got my manager to approve my manager's manager it went all the way up to the product org it went through the committee and it happened they all said yes I get to launch this thing and like in six months it's gonna die but I actually think this is actually a good startup opportunity I think that if somebody built the third party LinkedIn games app like I don't know fully I haven't explored the LinkedIn API and like what's all possible but if you can hook in and if you can build a game on top of LinkedIn that's just like a total Green Field opportunity and LinkedIn will buy it if you do a good job if you build the actual games product that's getting engagement there and you you don't have to invent the games just steal the games and you're basically saying proven game in new new social graph um and that's that's the whole business model here that's pretty insane I did not see that they were doing this and that is actually quite smart LinkedIn is the the Behemoth that somehow always works and so it's quite wise that they're doing this you know the one that the one that I don't believe in is Netflix is doing games I don't know if you've ever seen like they have a games thing in like there's a trivia game you can play in Netflix but also if you go to the App Store and you search Netflix as the game producer they have like 50 game titles it's like pretty insane how many mobile games that they have I don't understand this I don't think it's gonna work I don't understand the tie between this but you know basically Secrets out it's like yo games make a lot of money and people use it all the time um maybe we too should be in the games market and that's wild that's what they're trying to do uh that's awesome kudos to those guys I've not seen that I will um let me do a quick Thrill of the show I want to I want to promote something I'm going to try and make it extra thrill have you ever thought while you're building stuff you think to yourself am I doing this right like I remember being in San Francisco and I thought well you know Sean's got a fancy office therefore we have to have a fancy office or you know this particular CEO said you have to focus on this one thing so I have to focus on this one thing so to grow Hampton we came up with this podcast called MoneyWise and MoneyWise is basically like a personal finance podcast but for high net worth people and I've done eight or nine of the episodes as like the temporary host and I want to tell you what my biggest takeaway which is to get wealthy or even to spend the money once you're wealthy there's no one way that people are doing it there's a lot of different ways that people are doing it and I've already like recorded I think 12 or 15 of these and I had to do nine already for the the the um first season dude it's first of all it's insane that people r all this information so we basically what we do is we have people come on and they reveal their income their expenses exactly what their portfolio looks like and then like we'll dive deep on one topic like parenting or what are they Anonymous or they put their name on it I I haven't listened to it half and half so sometimes they're Anonymous and what we do is we change the name and we we actually change the voice and so there's a bunch of people who you who you know of that have been on but they changed the voice but then sometimes like the guy from simple modern came on and he's completely uh open about it and he'll say here's exactly how much I have in my uh bank account here's what we have in my index or in my portfolio here's how much income I have it's insane that people reveal this amount of information it's almost scary and so my big takeaway is one there's no one way to do it two I'm shocked that people reveal all this information and number three the more money you get the more intentional you have to become because these people will make literally a hundred million and they don't spend any of it and they're like I I don't even know what to do with this money what's been a uh lesson learned either in probably in the spending side so how what what's something somebody said about how they spend that you were like oh that's a good idea that's a cool intentional way of going about this we talked about giving money away last time you can't use that one use a different one so I I firmly believe that owning more than one home is a massive pain in the ass and that's a dream that people want to have they want to have a second or third or sometimes fourth home that a lot of these people have have I think that is a huge pain in the ass replace the word home with problem it's like I have a second problem in Tahoe I have a third problem in Florida that I go visit once a year nice problems dude it's such a pain in the ass is to have that and and unilaterally people seem to regret having multiple homes and so being intentional about spending money uh seems like a huge deal one rich person one of the very few rich people think that I think is totally worth it flying private uh I think that is the one thing where it actually might live up to the he when people I think buying a plane sorry Preston I don't know if that's worth it but I think chartering a jet as much as you can absolutely worth it and uh so we're doing this podcast whatever it's called MoneyWise you guys should look it up I'll tell you quick quickly I uh I had this premise to make a hit podcast I think you need one or more of the following you either need great production you need great delivery you need uh a unique perspective so unique perspective is like LeBron James talking uh great delivery is typically like Comedians and then great production is like cereal or whatever like these like wandery things my Gap in the market that I wanted to exploit was the first one I think you and I do number two number three and I wanted to do number one and so so far it appears to be working um so if you're a Creator those are the three the three ways I think to do a podcast and that's my little pitch on MoneyWise congrats that good good thriller show I liked it um all right Let's do let's do some other ones do you have another good one or can I do my AI camera one real quick do your AI camera one cuz I have some funny to tell you all right AI cameras so I play in this basketball league in San Francisco uh shout out to Ruben torberg who who host this league he's been hosting it for like 10 years and um it's basically it's called SF Tech Hoops I think it's called and basically it's like people from the tech industry that like to play play basketball and for a long time Ruben basically he runs the league with some real heart and I really appreciate that meaning he makes the teams he has the league there's the table Stakes what you expect teams jerseys referee scoreboard great but then what he does is every week he writes an email recap with gifts and whatever and he basically like team one took on team three they were led by S par he scored 13 points and he had a great buzzer beater blah blah blah but then in the second half this is what happened and so he writes these great updates from the commiss so he writes his own like internal newsletter for the thing the second thing he does is he films it he used to film it basically put two tripods with the iPhone on each side and he would try to afterwards go through and cut a highlight and highlight is really generous term because you're talking about out of shape Tech dudes like I I made a game-winning shot last week and in my head and if you asked anybody that I talked to afterwards this was [ __ ] Jordan against the Cavs in ' 89 or whatever I you know I was I was flying through the air you know hit the shot at the buzzer it was amazing it was like just and then I watched the clip and I was like uh like you could literally you couldn't fit a book under my feet where I jumped I was like this is ridiculous this looks slow this looks terrible this is like a game loser not a game winner so highlight is a little bit generous but either way he puts the the you know the TLC into to running this league so he just bought this new thing that is a GameChanger and he bought this AI based camera called I think it's called vo there's a and there's a bunch of these there's like four companies doing this but Veo check this out basically it's one camera that you uh it's a like a smart camera that you post on a on a tripad tripod and it does a couple of very basic things things that sound trivial but make a huge difference so he used to have two iPhones because you needed to record both sides of the court and basically for one iPhone half the time when when everybody runs to the other side of the court it's just empty and so then he could never have like a full video of the game because you couldn't get the camera to follow it right you'd have to hire somebody to manually like swivel their head and do this but now with AI basically it's one camera that just tracks the ball at all times so this works in soccer it works in basketball it works in football it's just just tracks the ball and the players and just keeps everything in the center of the frame without having to have a human doing it the second thing it does is it uploads it all to the cloud the third thing it does is it live streams at all which is cool because now people can watch your games which is like you know friends and family can watch games um the fourth thing it does is it could try to cut highlights so it can basically try to identify a cool moment and then cut the highlights or keep track of stats it's just getting better and better these are all software updates from here the hardware is just camera with a with enough you know enough of a chip inside that can connect it to the Internet connect it to the AI software and so these companies are crushing it like he they raised over a hundred million dollars in funding and it's like some European company um there's four or five competitors all of them have raised raised a bunch of money and I think they're all doing really well so I noticed this at our game um and then my brother-in-law who's got a kid that that plays like competitive soccer she's like you know seven years old and I was like dude have you seen this thing he's like bro it's on every field like this is like you can't go to youth soccer now and not like every single field has one of these and so I think the same way that you know Steve Jobs had like the vision I think it was jobs or maybe it was Bill Gates but it was like a computer on every desk I think it was Gates it a computer on every desk was the was the goal a personal computer and I think now it's going to be basically a camera on every field right and it's like every single high school every single middle school every a game every you know travel team they're going to use these things because why not well somebody's going to make the investment one time they really it's not one time so uh all right so for the the most popular version it's $1,000 onetime expense and then it's $130 per month yeah the most expensive one I think there's like cheaper ones than that I don't think you have to get the the crazy one but yeah like it the that price is going to go down like the Thousand Hardware is going to go down but the you know 100 100 bucks a month is going to stay there but if you're like a team or really you don't even have to buy it per team it's like the league needs to have it right so it's like the the venue needs to have it and I just predict that every venue is going to have these like they will get whoever wins going to get these into every single field every single court and it'll just be that way tennis wrestling like every Fringe sport there's people who want to watch it's the family the friends the athletes themselves and their coaches and um there's enough motivation to do this their website is so good that it makes me want to play soccer it's sort of like it's sort of like GoPro where I like the the footage is awesome that like I got to get into snowboarding right now just so I can go and like live a life worth dude that's how I felt when you were talking about the magazine stuff I was like yeah the wind blowing through my hair my hair as I'm on this boat yeah maybe I do want that lifestyle yeah do I want to be a boater uh that's how I feel when I when I go to their website this is a a this is awesome B I'm shocked at how large this is I guess it's not a not a surprise but it sort of is a surprise that there's multiple companies that have raised nine figures to build this I think these are doing you know 50 million plus a year in Revenue minimum um you know the leaders of this space I don't know the exact numbers but like ballparking I would I would be surprised if it was under that this is absolutely insane I never in a million years would have thought that this would become a thing well I have the opposite opinion which is this is an obvious idea it's obvious that it's working but it's not obvious that like no I think this was obvious before dude when um like why didn't you start it well because the idea this idea has been around for a long time so for example in NBA stadiums they there's like an Enterprise version of this called second spectrum and um there's a company called Synergy sports that basically there's like cameras that they install in the um in the aay venue that tracks all the players and all the motion and it keeps track of certain specific Advanced stats for the teams and so this idea of like oh wow couldn't you either install cameras or use computer vision to to track stats that's that's interesting then there was flow flow Sports which is basically live streaming Niche sports like you know Jiu-Jitsu competitions wrestling competitions and they were doing tens of millions of year in Revenue yeah their office is here is in Austin and I've been to it and it's sick it's really cool it's a big company and you for those those are for more official competitions like you know the Texas state you know karate championships or whatever not like you know little Suzie soccer game which like you know Susie's parents and Grandma and whatever want to be able to watch like back in college I remember um my my roommate Trevor he would always watch his little sister's basketball games and he'd be on his computer and he's watching this greeny footage and I'm like who the hell's streaming this ninth grade girls Wyoming basketball regular season game and he's like he's like I pay for this thing because like we pay and then this guy films it and then he's you know he uploads it later it's not live stream but he pay uploads it later and I watch the shitty footage but like I really want to see my sisters play like that matters to me I'm willing to pay like my price sensitivity it's like I will pay the equivalent of a Netflix monthly subscription but instead of giving me like all the world's best content I get my my niece's and it's like there's an emotional reason to do that so this idea was around for a long time I've noticed this but it needed a technology inflection and it needed the AI camera where you don't have to hire somebody the quality is now good enough where it's actually fun to watch uh you can live stream it record it cut highlights all that [ __ ] and so now I feel like the idea it's an idea whose time has come and um we were I was talking to my buddy Luke about the AI like the AI wave he's in my like AI tutoring group where we we like learn about AI together every week once a week and he's like you know whenever there's a new technology shift he goes I always think back of what he go I asked the question what is the restaurants on the uh menus on the internet of this wave I go menus on the internet what do you mean he goes well when the internet first came out the very first obvious startup idea was like well let's just take like restaurant menus and put them on the Internet he's like before we could do door Dash and online ordering like all the nextg [ __ ] the first thing you do is you just put the menus on the internet just a picture of the menu and he's like for every Tech wave there's always like the like very obvious it's kind of not where the thing is going to go but it's like immediate value ad no-brainer like wave one of what people do on these apps it's like for for the iPhone remember it was like the beer app the flashlight app the calculator app like that was the menus on the internet and now with AI there's some things like this that are like the menus on the internet version of of what you could do with with AI so your AI tutoring person it's now warped into a studying group oh yeah bro it's growing what is it I I didn't want to tell you it's like Fight Club it's like fight club with no fighting just screen sharing on Zoom but is it like a group of you who meet and you just come like with homework and questions it's three of us who people I think are awesome that I wanted an excuse to hang out with so it's me it's Matt maio and it's my buddy Luke and I'm like I wanted to hang out with these people more anyways they're also in AI they're investing they may you know start companies in the space whatever and it was like hey let's just do this together that way it's a little study group where you you know you see something and then one person says something and then the other person pushes back he like well I don't know what about this and it everybody gets a little smarter for for doing it what are your biggest takeaways now with AI then because I don't know much about it so Sam Alman recently said something he goes there's two types of companies in AI there's the companies that can't wait for us to release a new model and there there's companies that can't sleep at night knowing we're going to release a new model meaning like we're going to crush you they're not saying this but the way they've architected their business is if we make GPT 5 better than gp4 and we improve a bunch of capabilities the model gets smarter it gets better at doing all the things it's doing which he's like by the way that's exactly what's going to happen duh like insane to bet against that he's like they risk being like you know you know blown up like you know they're they become obsolete when that happens I pretty sure he goes we're going to steamroll them yeah he goes we they will they those companies will get steamrolled yeah which is not a good thing that that is amazing so then the other companies he's like the other companies are begging us can't wait for the next model to come out because it's just going to make their product better so what's an ex so then the the group we were talking through like okay what does that really mean who are the companies that fall into group a and fall into Group B and there's an interesting discussion around that but I'll just give you like a simple example let's say you're some company that you do transcription translation and whatever in you know four companies that are rev.com uh but not rev.com so rev.com says pay us rev.com is a good example of the steamroll type company so it's basically it's like it pay us we do transcription really good we have human transcribers they're great it's like well guess what it's going to be better than the human transcribers gp5 it's going to be awesome it's gonna be way cheaper than rev.com it's GNA like drive your price to zero and be better so that's like rev.com is in trouble um then you have a company that's like cool we do transcription translation in the context of this certain healthare thing this workflow where doctors need to transcribe their notes on the go and it needs to be really high fidelity and today that transcription is done by a human but like whatever it's like they have a full like Enterprise workflow and if the transcription capabilities get better they're like awesome our product got better but the product was like open AI is never going to build the thing that integrates in with the the doctor's you know like um whatever you know Healthcare record system that they use like they embed themselves in a workflow and that's like 90 % of the product and the 10% improvements to the the the AI the transcription the translation the whatever it is if those get better great our product got more effective but it didn't make our product obsolete because we have this 90% that we've built around it that are that is really specific to a certain use case certain workflow and um and so we we can't wait for the next model to come out versus maybe other companies like rev.com or companies that are like we're like open AI but we're better at like you know here here's an example of a company I think is at risk you know um these companies that do voice text to voice so like you know 11 Labs is one play HT is another it's like basically they're like we're better than like we can do AI you type in a thing and we can create a human sounding Ai and we're gonna fine-tune our model to do that but then open AI releases like every every month they just release a new thing it's like yeah we have text to voice now check it out here's the demo and the Demo's awesome it's like it's only going to get better and then it's just going to become a standard API for anybody to use to use text of voice it's like I think those companies that are trying to be like we have our our own proprietary model our own fine-tuned use case they're going to really struggle because they can't compete with the Behemoth how are you taking advantage of this then uh from a business point of you or are you I would say on the investing side I'm much more measured twice cut once right now meaning I'm not spraying praying a bunch of checks into a bunch of random AI companies I think it's really hard to figure out right now which companies actually have legs and also they're all really overpriced so have this combination of really high price really low traction um product is really good in a demo but not really good in production and I don't know if they're going to become obsolete due to opening eyes so there's a bunch of problems there it's like actually a better bet was just like in the stock market just buy companies that have like a massive Advantage when it comes to ai go buy Nvidia buy Facebook buy buy a bunch of stocks that are going to benefit from AI whether they're not just like one random startup that I'm hoping is the one out of a thousand startup that becomes enormous well that's what uh Morgan Stanley put out this report and they said um they go uh uh AI is going to be a big deal unfortunately we well not unfortunately but we think that it's going to impact big companies who are already established it's just going to make them sign you're gonna get there's gonna be more value in making those companies better than there is starting new companies exact and we and they actually said marketing and I the reason I thought it was cool is because uh I own stock in a in a marketing technology company and they're like we think that marketing techn ol and and that type of stuff Salesforce hubot whatever that's going to be the biggest sector that's going to use this [ __ ] to to grow well I think it's I think it's a safer bet and it's a more obvious bet the I don't I don't think that investing a startups right now is a bad idea I just meant uh it's really hard right now and it's unclear to me and I haven't put in the time to get a lot of clarity on which which I don't have a bunch of startups I'm like these are going to be winners in this space I just haven't been able to get that level of clarity yet so it's like measure twice cut once meaning first I'm like let me just learn this at in more depth let me use all these tools which is what we do so like in these sessions we will just be like cool here's a tool that can do X and then I he's like you drive and I go and I start trying to build a thing that's going to be useful in one of my businesses are you paying this person yeah still dude this is so smart because we did it as a group like the sessions are more fun and it's like a pretty valuable network of people to be really tight with right like which is ultimately what you want you want the thing to be so mutually beneficial that the financial outcomes of the thing are so secondary like the primary should be the session is fun and these people are awesome and I get to hang with these people these people I get to basically you know iron sharpens iron with these people right now that's like what I wanted this to get to um and so I feel really good about that dude that's so smart more people should do this I mean I used to do this with book clubs but if I had a very specific interest like you have right now and even if it's just a temporary thing that lasts six or 12 months that's the way to go it's so smart that's such a smart thing for you to do well the smartest people I think always did this like en crypto I know people were doing this early on um you know I remember hearing these like sessions about South by Southwest where I I forgot who's room it was but it was like everybody used to go up to um Garrett Camp's room and at South byest Southwest there's like 15 people that were all kind of like loose friends like this but like a lot of mutual respect and it wasn't like a paid party or some like event with sponsors it was like no dude like we're here to to basically talk about everybody should have opinions on where they think the puck is going and then they would debate and that's how Matt actually got in with Chris Saka Saka was like who's this [ __ ] that has like really interesting things to say it's like he's an agent at CA in Hollywood like this guy should be in the tech world and he recruited him from there and this is where like you know they were this a lot of the guys who invested in Uber early on like Jarrett and um Travis were in the room and they were you know talking about Uber at the time and Gary Vee was in the room there's a like this this legendary story I have no idea what actually happened but I remember hearing these stories and being like I need to get into rooms like that what is a room like that how do I make a room like that if I either need to get in or I need to make a room like that what was the story of the room well I just told told you yeah AR was that the second time this episode Sean CED an attitude with me well yeah I'm like I told you the story you're like well so what happened I'm like well that's I told you everything I know bro I don't know anything else does Zoom have like a [ __ ] slap animation that I could use I know they got a thumbs up yeah you know a thumbs up and it like starts bubbling Hearts behind you do they got a middle finger one of those let's see what happens does that work second I apologize I'm a little sassy today I could be caddy on Wednesdays I know my bad um I apologize is that the Pod do we wrap up there I guess so I think I need to go work on myself go meditate chill out um all right that's the pod [Music]

all right what's happening everyone today's podcast is with Kevin asiru so Kevin has this company called epic gardening epic gardening started as a Blog where Kevin would just blog about his hobby as a gardener he started it in 2016 and in this podcast he's going to tell us the revenue for every year that he's been doing it but this year they're going to do something like $45 million a year in revenue and Kevin walks through how they got traffic how he's built the company how he bought other companies to make epic gardening a big business it's incredibly fascinating he's super transparent with all the numbers so he goes through deal by deal all the companies that they bought how much they paid for it how they found the company how they found other companies that they didn't end up buying and why they didn't buy it it's a really fascinating story this guy is really really cool I think in about five years this guy's going to be a really really big deal he's already a pretty big deal but I think in five years he's going to be like chip and Joanna you guys have to listen to this podcast he's a really fascinating guy let me know what you think all right check it out [Music] dude so it's finally nice to talk to you you uh I didn't know who you were and then on the podcast Sean like told your story and I'm like oh I recognize this guy from everywhere and I didn't realize how big of a business that you'd built so congratulations that's insane right yeah yeah it's been it's been a crazy ride it's been a crazy ride I just watched one of your YouTube videos where one of your videos had just gotten I I think you had 70 million views and it's just like you kneeling on a like a little kneeling like device so you can Garden on your knees more easily and you're like I've been getting notice in the streets because of the silly kneeling video yeah that video might haunt me I I think it's the most viral thing I've ever made it's a short form video so I'd seen this little kneeling device it was like a Instagram reel of a German trade show and it was just this little kneeling device where you kind of popped I think it's made for Brick Layers so I saw it and I was like you know what I kind of want to try it out just to see and so I I had my team grab one there was like one in San Diego where I live and I made that piece of content in like maybe maybe 10 minutes maximum uh and and then edited it up tossed it out put it on I think Tik Tok first and it just started ripping so I I was like okay I know this thing it has some legs so then I threw it on Instagram and Facebook and I threw it on YouTube I think it's at like 150 million views across the platform and the whole logic of doing it was let put this product in front of our gardening audience and see if they like it so then we can either hit up the manufacturer and carry it on our store or we can maybe make some modifications to it that make it a little better suited for gardening and then that it's basically just Market validation right by the time we went that Viral we hit up the manufacturer which is a German company and they're like we would love to sell you some but our entire stock in America is gone so every distributor we already have has sold out so we can't we can't get it to you how much uh re missed Revenue was that I have no idea yeah what's your guess over or under 10 million oh it's got to I think it's under for sure because I think these things are like 50 bucks maybe I don't know how many we would have sold but I don't think there was some crazy Supply in the US uh but yeah it's kind it was kind of a bummer so my only the only thing I've ever gotten out of it is just being memd to to death about it dude so you the reason you're sort of interesting to me is did you start with like an internet marketing background cuz I know that you were interested in Search and SEO and stuff was it like be an agency and then I mean were you even into gardening and plants and all that stuff or did you were you like I'm the plant daddy now because I've got this website and so like which came first what came first was yeah I guess I guess designing websites did come first because I came out of college with an accounting degree but I played online poker to pay for school and so that kind of like put me off the path of wanting to be an accountant right out of the gate and you were making money yeah I made like2 $250,000 probably playing poker and so I I used that to pay for school and then I had some money to like sit on was it all online yeah it was all online I hated playing in person I because it's so slow because when you're playing online you're playing faster but you're also playing like more tables what makes a good online poker player because I would think I don't play poker really I've only played like 10 or 20 times it's just like it seems like reading body language and things like that is part of the game but what makes a good online player just straight math straight math is a big part of it so like understanding probability Theory and understanding the types of hands that someone could or couldn't have in a particular situation uh but you're you're kind of right like eventually when you play enough online poker it gets down to the point where you know the people's screen names you're playing with and you probably have played with these people like over days weeks or months depending on how often they play and you can even get down to the point where you know in this particular position like I'm sitting on the button they're sitting in this position and they they wait 3 seconds longer than they nor do and it's this person's screen name a lot of the times you can develop some sort of weird sick sense and you know you're like I'm I'm like nearly sure that's a bluff and you'll call them and you made $250,000 over four years doing that yeah something like that I didn't track it super well it was like 250,000 that's insane that is insane yeah yeah so it threw me off the path of wanting to be an accountant for sure uh and then when I got out of school I played poker for like six more months or something and then quit but I had nothing to to do so I started playing video games and then I was designing websites to just pay some bills and then I got into the marketing thing because I was like well once you sell a website it's sold so you make your 1,500 bucks or two grand or whatever the hell I was charging at that time uh so then I got into SEO stuff and I built the gardening blog at the same time because I was getting into gardening I was doing it with my brother over a summer but I was like I need a I need like a digital business card like I need a little calling card so I built the gardening blog as a way to show the website design clients like hey look look what I can build what year was that that would have been 2013 dude I think in the same year I did the same thing as you were you reading like smart passive income yeah yeah okay so Pat for those young listeners I think you and I were on the young side probably at the time of his blog I think you and I are the same age I'm 34 and 36 and uh smart passive income was like one this guy Pat Flynn he's still quite popular he's one of the early bloggers of like making money on the internet and he had a what did he do he did like a he wrote like a Blog in an ebook on how to like get your building like green or lead certified or something like that and he was making money doing it and he would display all of his income and revenue online which at the time was like insane and then he uh did like a food truck a food TR like a book on how to create a food truck or something like that and he like was like I'm gonna rank high on search and I'm going to blog throughout the way so you guys can see how I do it I read that and I created a poisy poison ivy like how to treat poison ivy website at the same time and it was making like $1,000 a day and I was like copying everything he was doing and I have a feeling that you were reading that same blog at the same time I have a even more cringe story around that time so I was reading Pat like crazy you just call me cringe I mean we all that that first site that you make it's always kind of weird like come on poison s stupid I have one worse than that for sure so Pat to me was like a god back in the day because he's a half Filipino half white guy living in San Diego building businesses are you half Filipino I'm half Philipino half white and we've become good friends now which is awesome um but when I read it I was like okay cool I see the blueprint Pat's got this like green certification thing and so my choice was to I created a website called Coco buttercream. org and so I go Coco buttercream. gor and I start reviewing every cocoa butter cream that's on Amazon and was using an alias and like come on like I was like early 20s I was doing some dumb stuff and I I was Susie Michaels a mother of two who was like reviewing how all these different cocoa Butters worked on me uh and and then I you know you hook into Amazon Affiliates and I remember it took me like a month I made like two bucks on that site and I was like oh my God I made money in a way that's not like someone just paying me you know uh and it kind of blew my mind like the whole saying like everyone remembers your first dollar in the internet I it wasn't Coco butter cream but and then and and that's when you got into like internet marketing but then did you do like a Kendrick Lamar website too yeah that was that was uh man that was probably like a couple years later so the story on that one is my cousin I was living with my cousin at the time he was like a biomechanical engineer and I'm over here doing all this weird stuff on the internet like building sites and stuff and he's kind of getting intrigued by it and a friend hits me up and he was like Hey I have all these blogs that I need to sell I just need some money I have Kendrick Lamar Rita or school boy Q like all these sort of upand cominging artists and this would have been like 2014 I think he goes you want to buy one and I go I I'm kind of doing my own thing but maybe I'll have my cousin buy it and we'll do it together so my cousin Johnny actually puts up the money for it and I think I had like 10% equity in this Kendrick Lamar website and we start like scouring the internet and we actually become like the biggest source of Kendrick Lamar news on the internet before he drops his first album good kid Mad City and so no one really knows Kendrick like only super fans know him and there was a point where like I think Kendrick's manager even called my cousin was like like we really appreciate what you're doing for Kendrick like you're putting his name out there da da and the way we monetized that is we were just selling shirts just like print on demand shirts I think we probably made like 30 or 40 Grand doing that and then after the album dropped and he blew up all of a sudden he like trademarked his name and we had to shut the site down and stuff but that was another like weirdo internet thing that we did all right look the question that Sean and I get asked constantly is what skill set did we develop early on in our careers that kind of changed our business career and that's an easy answer it's copywriting we've talked about copywriting and how it's changed our life constantly on this podcast and we've give a ton of tips a ton of techniques a ton of Frameworks and throughout all the podcast well we decided to aggregate all of that into one simple document so you can read all of it you can see how we've learned copyrighting but you can see the resources that we turn to on a daily basis you can see the Frameworks the techniques we use it's in a simple document you can check it out in the link below all right now back to the show what was the main thing though was it the gardening like gardening websites the whole time no the the gardening thing didn't really start until for real like it was a hobby that I love doing and I've I've done it every every year of my life since 2013 um but it was just like a a hobby blog until 2016 uh when I went full-time on it and hobby blog and that you were actually like into gardening and you're like I'm just going to I'm just going to create content around but did you see any numbers where you're like uh this could be big company or was it straight Joy no no I mean it was a mix right like I was gardening for fun and then I would just document whatever whatever I was doing and like make a YouTube video or make a blog post and I would try to monetize it like I'd make some ad revenue or I'd make some affiliate Revenue but I never thought it could be huge like I remember talking to friends that were all kind of doing the same thing at the time and I was like man if this thing could just make two grand a month or if it could make five grand a month like that'd be amazing then I wouldn't have to go get a job uh because I think my mind didn't understand the scale that any any business could really become at that point in time so yeah took it took a while for me to realize the potential of it and then you you kind of like had this it's a it's a it's not like a cliche to most people but for the media world it's like a cliche at this point but at the time when you were doing it it was like content and commerce was actually like a pretty Innovative idea which is I'm going to build this huge blog and instead of just making money on Advertising in I'm going to sell my own products which is like it sounds silly that that that I'm calling that Innovative but like when you were getting going that was a thing I mean I had a Blog and I was like I don't think that you can like sell your own products I'd rather just stick to like what I know which is content and ads and I was like totally against selling stuff but you made the right decision for sure that's a significantly better business it's it's a way better business and yeah the brief story on that is 2016 I I go full-time on epic gardening I was uh at scribe Media or book in a box it was called before that I was like a second employee there so I quit that go full-time on Epic it was just a bloging YouTube channel did you have any Revenue when you quit yeah I was making $450 a month I have this whole spreadsheet of like what it was making at the time so at that time I actually thought I was going to farm like legit Farm in people's front yards and uh like aggregate all their square footage and like sell that produce to restaurants and stuff like that right I mean that sounds like really hard yeah it's it's a really hard way to make a smallish amount of money which there's people that do it and I actually respect it a lot but it's cool it's cool yeah it's just not scale uh so so I go okay how would I just make this blog make a couple Grand a month because it was making 450 so if I could make 450 I could probably make two if I could make two I could make five and so I started growing it and I think that year the blog made 17 grand total uh about six months of the year uh and then the next year year it was 72,000 revenue and this is all media because I haven't done any product yet right 2018 it was 225 and then 2019 is where I had that realization that you mentioned where I was like wait why am I just making money from ads and like brand sponsorships like what do the brands want from you when they do a brand deal they want access to your audience well I have complete access to my own audience so why don't I just be the brand selling to my own my own audience uh and so what I did is I realized like well every piece of content I put out is basically a search for validating demand for whatever is in that content and so in all these photos I'm putting out because I'm I'm at this point I'm gardening in Hillcrest San Diego in like a very small front yard in in a pretty Urban part of downtown San Diego and so I'm like filming my content there I have these little raised beds in the front yard which is just a way to grow plants and they're made out of metal and every time I took a photo of these everyone's like what are those what are those things in the photo like where'd you get those so I was like I actually don't know like a brand just sent these to me and I put them in the front yard and so I started emailing this company they're from Australia I emailed them like maybe once or twice a quarter for like a year saying like hey can I get these can I just like somehow get these to America and sell them and they're like no no we we already have someone we're working with like we don't need to do that and then the beginning of 2019 they emailed back and said like hey are are you still interested in in carrying our products we like a distributor just just isn't working with us anymore I'm like yeah sure let's do it and I think I probably had like 70 80 grand in the business bank account at that point in time all right so it's like it's like promising you're not rolling in it yet but it's media so it's mostly profit yeah it's mostly profit and it's a small business with with nearly zero employees so to me I'm like I'm making like a like a mid-level doctor's salary out of this business now you know so I'm I'm chilling I'm gardening I'm liking my life um so I hit these guys up and they're like yeah sure like here's how it works and I'm like holy [ __ ] I don't know how buying product works because I'm I'm used to media and so much like like the sort of cringe early days the way I tried to do it was sort of sort of noob like I was like okay how do I buy the product like well you have to pay us you know here's all these different like shipping terms so I bought a 20 foot container of these raised beds for I think $35,000 which was like half the money that I had uh and I go okay well what what happens when they get to America like what am I supposed to do like well you got to receive it at the port and then you that container has to like go somewhere and then you have to unpack it and then you have to ship it and I'm like okay cool like thanks for that information so what I tried to do is I tried to rent a uh storage facility out of a Costco and like just one of the ones that you like go to if you're going to move for a year you know and you put all your furniture in there so I tried to do that and I was like trying to figure out how to get it for the port to the storage facility and then I was trying to look up like well how do you get internet in the storage facility so you can so I can print the labels oh and you were going to literally mail these things out yourself cuz I didn't know anything about Commerce I didn't know you could like send it to a 3pl or you could send to a warehouse how many like units of stuff did you have I think it was 550 beds at that time okay so like that's a that's a ton but it's like all right I'm just going to go to the Post Office four times a week and I'll just I'll figure it out I mean that's a lot of work but I guess it's kind of reasonable I I thought it was reasonable and the reason why I was trying to do it like that is because when I when I ordered it and they packed the container in Australia I was like okay cool guys like to my audience I was like hey you guys asked where these things were from I figured it out I put up a really crappy Shopify store and I was like here they are and then I sold them out in like four or five days oh no while they were still getting to America so I knew I I knew it was working right and so then what I did is I used that money to buy another container and then that was on the way and then that sold out and then I was like oh my God like I think there's something really going on here so what was your Revenue in 19 the year you started selling stuff so 19 was like 550 and half of it was the product so in year one like immediately half was was product so I was like oh my God I think what I've been building this whole time is the top of a business and not the bottom of it like I thought media was the whole thing I was like oh actually media is right here and it monetizes but the bottom is actually where where U the business lies the weird Innovative idea I remember uh so like uh my friend Nathan Barry has this awesome blog post called like billion dollar blogs and it's like basically the story of a handful of people who started out blogging and then built companies around the blogs and the most famous example is probably glossier or I think that's what it's called glossier it's the the women's makeup uh brand that started as Emily Weiss I think her name is she had like a fashion blog and then she was like oh this selling stuff is way better than selling ads and it became a a billion dollar company and he has a few more examples of that and that that's when I first read about that idea but I still thought this is way too intimidating and like too challenging and particularly for me at the time I ran a Business website and I was like I can't what am I gonna possibly sell yeah like what product yeah so like it didn't really make sense for me but even still I was like this is too intimidating but you were living it and doing it which is pretty cool yeah I mean frankly like it was quite intimidating to me but I just was too either dumb or smart to like real ized that and just went ahead and did it but anyways like to wrap that up like I ended up talking to a friend of mine who was in Commerce and he's like what the hell are you doing dude just get like a 3pl and get a freight forwarder and send the container to there hook the Shopify to there and then they'll ship it all out for you and that's what I ended up doing and so that that was kind of the Genesis of selling products at Epic gardening and didn't you grow that to like 7 million in Revenue with like four people yeah so yeah I mean I think 2020 would have been 2.8 in Revenue so almost a 6 Xing year on year and then 2021 was 7.3 7.4 or so and most of it was product at that point in time and that would have been on a team of me my garden assistant my actual assistant a video editor and and a writer and that was it that's all we had on 7.3 in Revenue what could your profit be oh man it was probably like 50% or something like that so you're rolling in it yeah yeah yeah well because because the thing about it is you if you run it like that and that was with Zars or paid spend right and so I have no acquisition cost my acquisition cost is equal to my media because that's the only way I was getting the word out but my media is not a cost it's a it's a profit driver and so it's that term negative CAC like I had negative CAC on the business why raised money then I know you raised I think $17 million why cuz like if you the cool thing about boot traing a company is you could do whatever the hell you want yeah and there's like freedom in that and that's frankly my favorite part about business is like the freedom of like you're creating your own Empire you could do whatever the hell you want if you want to grow it you can if you don't want to grow it you don't have to um you get all the money you don't have to answer to anyone I assume at this point you own you still own 100% of the company at least if I'm you I'm not giving Equity to my employees because it's like uh I've been doing this by myself for a long time I'll I'll rather just pay you a high salary why even take $17 million yeah I wrestled with it for a long time like maybe that deal took like six months to close I would say and at least for the trer group that's not some massive deal for them like that's not that's not a ton of money for them it's it was a huge amount for me the the logic ended up being I was like do I know what I'm going to do in the next couple years like do I understand the complexity of the business I I had built because it's a that's a really lean team to be at 7.3 with like a Commerce business shipping product out there's like a bunch of redundancy issues like at that around like anything north of five million it's like all right we've got something here we've got a seed of something working here it potentially could be huge like I should have some I should actually like shift to being a proper CEO and like with being being a proper CEO is like hiring extra employees even if like you know like at that point it's like with with the size that you were everyone was working 110% and at that point it's you kind of like almost purposely become a slightly more inefficient because like if I get 70% of effort from 10 people that's better than 110% effort of five people and I'll have some redundancy so people can like chill a little bit or someone gets sick or quits like there's actually like some proper CEO work you have to do at that stage I would think oh yeah oh yeah totally I mean and the operational side like the hiring Etc side like I had no clue because I was on a team of me and four contractors like I didn't I didn't really have hiring experience and then on the Commerce side it's not like we got to 7.3 selling like an online online course which would be a lot simpler to fulfill like there's there's inventory planning there's like sales tax Nexus that you hit in all these different states that you have to file for so there was a lot of complexity I was like staring down the barrel of that I I knew that I didn't know about I was at least smart enough to know I didn't know what was coming uh and then frankly like that was just a crazy period in the market like 2021 was probably still the last best time to do any kind of raising and um and then at the same time I was like look I'm already ahead of in my space like no one no Creator in gardening is is doing what I'm doing and so why don't I just make sure that I stay ahead and partner with people who actually understand how these media to Commerce businesses are built and that's what ended up making me do the deal were you able to take any money off the table or did the 17 go straight to the balance sheet I was able to take some off which was great um yeah that's like lifechanging right yeah it was it was life-changing and then like I had bought a warehouse um to to start fulfilling cuz eventually like I moved off the 3pl I was like you know what I'm paying these guys like 30 40K a month in fulfillment fees why don't I just like start a separate company buy a warehouse and then become my own tenant and like build equity in the real estate side and so when we raised I I actually didn't that that warehouse didn't go with it and so I I had the warehouse too so like the way the whole personal financial math worked out I was like the way I live I'm good now and I can just like fully focus on trying to win this space so that was another part of it do you have family uh yeah I I have a girlfriend yeah and then a lot of my family lives in San Diego what's it feel like to uh be I don't know if you were single at the time or not but what's it feel like to be a young guy uh and you're like I'm good I'm good for potentially forever yeah I mean it's kind of uh underwhelming I guess I don't know was it like that for you I don't know for me I I'd already made quite a bit of money running up through 2021 just sort of solo and so it was a huge change but it wasn't it wasn't like you know 1 million to $200 million net worth or something like that like the the way I live I just don't I just don't need it I guess um and so all I did was eliminate worry about like I don't know what if something medical goes wrong or I couldn't even figure out if I wanted to buy anything for a while like I didn't I didn't buy anything like fancy to celebrate or whatever not having money is the the period of my life where I didn't have as uh money was more stressful than the period of my life where I did have breathing room that that I completely agree with that I I always think like it mitigates all your downsides but it doesn't at least I haven't found that it makes you some massively happier person yeah yeah yeah yeah but you remember that that study where it was like $70,000 a year right that's [ __ ] that is absolutely [ __ ] that I agree is [ __ ] that I agree why do you agree that that's [ __ ] okay so first of all I think inflation adjusted isn't it like 160k now or something like that yeah even I think that numbers might be [ __ ] to too 160 Grand in in a in one of the top five cities uh shockingly doesn't go very far doesn't go far yeah I think I think that's [ __ ] because the things let's say you're making like 200 a year you can get like you can have someone come and clean the house or you can have like meal support or these sorts of things that that help you free your time up from things you like genuinely don't like to do uh there's things like I love to do that of course I could pay for like I obviously I grow my own food and I like cook meals and and bake my own bread and stuff like that I don't have to do that but like I I don't clean my house anymore right uh and so like things like that I think give me I don't know if like positive Joy would be the way I would phrase it though it's just like I don't have to do an annoying thing is the way I think about it yeah it's like uh you remember that book like the five languages of of love and it's like oh your girlfriend's like an active service woman so like if I do something nice for her she'll feel loved yeah there's like the five languages of love but for money where it's like for me it's not nice things but for some people it could be they love cars for me it's the same thing where I've got a cleaner who comes often and I just like genuinely feel happier not having to do my laundry and clean yeah uh and so in those like small things which frankly aren't expensive uh it it it it definitely makes you happier like those little small things I learned that all from REM same I learned that all from REM is is just he has like a surgical team on every single part of his life that he hates uh to do and I was like oh you know what that's actually pretty smart and so and he spends big on stuff I was with REM me on Saturday he he like always asks these like crazy questions where sometimes I'm I'm just wanting to chill and have fun and he's like Sam let me ask you a question what what's what's your rich life and I'm like I don't know man uh like let's just drink our coffee he's like no no no tell me your rich life and I'm like okay uh it's not stuff it's uh Services he goes what would happen if you 10xt your spending on your services and I was like coffee with him we had the same conversation with his ACC he goes he goes he goes how how how big would your staff be if it could be as big as you wanted it to be for your house and I was like I don't know like I I think I have like a cleaner and maybe like a cook every so often or something he's like oh man like what kind of cook you know he gets into the details he gets into the details he loves it he loves it and when he asks those questions frankly it does make me start thinking a like maybe I should do this and B like am I thinking too small like if I love something why don't I like get 10x more of of that thing and so it is like cool to think about he he does do a good job with that uh of like make of like pressuring me to think Beyond like how I'm thinking and and remit stuff has actually been life-changing for me same how big's the business now can you say yeah yeah we're we're about 90ish people uh and we're hoping to hit somewhere around like 40 45 million this year in Revenue that's insane right did you ever think that and are you doing it Prof profitably still now that even though you raised money yeah we're we're profitable we're profitable the first year after I think we were not because you know we hired quite a bit ahead of of growth because we were like way under hired with me and four contractors and then um this year this year we are you think uh how big how big do you think it's going to get in like five years I mean I think it's like a foregone conclusion to get above 100 million uh because we have we've made a couple Acquisitions we made two small ones and one large one and even just sort of growing those I think has a shot at at getting us past 100 I don't know how much bigger than that why acquire something instead of building it on your own it's really just speed and if you have the competency internally to do it did you I mean you you you studied accounting but did you know anything about acquiring a company or did churn and kind of hold your hand so the big the big acquisition where we bought the seed company that was churn and led a lot of the diligence on that cuz it's like way too complex a 30-year-old business like I there's no way I could do the the diligence on that but the two small Acquisitions I led those and they sort of just helped with the legalities of of getting it all done so the very first one was a seed tray so like when you when you're gardening you usually start seeds in like a little tray and a lot of these trays are made out of pretty flimsy plastic and they're just like throwa away things and so a friend of mine who was in the space on the media side of gardening who's like an educator he he was developing these trays and he hit me up and he's like hey can I come down to the house and just show you this new tray that I made to start seeds in and this was uh early 2021 I was like yeah sure come on down he comes down he shows me this tray and it's like this very super sturdy durable tray to start seeds in which solves like some of the problems of them being flimsy then he had like cut all these little slits in it there's like a big hole in the bottom which if you're a gardener you know it's like it makes it easier to like pop the seed out and put it out in the garden so I hold the tray and the second I hold it I've been gardening for like eight years now I'm like holy [ __ ] this is like the best seat starting tray I've ever seen in my life like for sure and he's like you can stand on it if you want to so I like I'm like 220 pounds so I stand on it with one foot it doesn't budge and I'm like okay like that thing's durable and so I go what do you want to do like I think this is a cool product uh do you want to like I can put it on my Shopify store and like see if the audience wants it and he's like yeah sure what do you think like we'll just split the profits 50/50 you have you have the audience I have the product and and let's go so I started teasing it in like Instagram or YouTube videos and it's an injection molded product so we can only make so many in a day you have to like press the mold and like accumulate inventory so we we built up like maybe a week or two of inventory or what we thought was and then I just put an Instagram reel out and I was like hey this is the coolest tray I've ever seen and there's a link in my bio to go grab it and we sold it out like Shopify has this live analytics you can look at it's awesome it's like it's like it's like just the biggest dopamine Rush when you start seeing that come in so I remember I I was scream recording H just to see uh just to kind of flex and and record the live screen and we sold out like a couple weeks inventory in like 25 seconds how much revenue was that it was like 25 or 30 grand I think so now that's a that's an entire line of products we own it's on our shop it's called our our epic Tray Line uh so if you go to our shop and you go to seed starting supplies you'll you'll see all the trays there so over the next like over the next like 3 four weeks we just like built up inventory dropped it sold it out built up inventory dropped it sold it out out and we were just splitting the profits and then I go to him and I was like hey look not only is this working like really well better than I thought but there's definitely more trades that we could make there's like different form factors and different ideas and like little domes you could put on top to keep humidity in or whatever and I was like but I can't make them because that's what you do and I'm like 95% of your sales so what if you just joined epic you know we' rais some money I was like you could be our product lead we we I can't really like buy the business based on Revenue because that that is we are your Revenue right and so how do how how do we structure a deal and so the deal we came up with without getting into like crazy specifics is we basically paid him for all of the assets like the the the molds themselves and and the research and development time and a premium on that um gave him some equity and hired him as our product lead and then we've built that line out to like I think like 12 or 15 SKS going D to C and wholesale now um and it's like I think I think we're like up 7x probably on the acquisition price as far as like Revenue after the fact so and and that wasn't like a big acquisition it was 7 500,000 so to me I'm like that's why you would that's why you would buy because I yeah and that's a great that's a great deal for everyone involved yeah exactly it was a total win-win what are the other two so the second biggest one we did w was actually a media acquisition so that was a Blog so a friend of mine from from like the old SEO days had built a gardening blog and we were hiring for a director of editorial like just someone to run our blog and our blog was doing well like maybe like eight 10 million sessions a year and that was monetizing off of display ads but then hopefully like people will go through and like buy some stuff on our store too all from search or mostly from search yeah it's like mostly search I say like 80% search um and so this guy emails me and he's like hey look I saw that that head of editorial position I'm working in SEO right now but I've also been building a gardening blog on the side it was called all about gardening.com which is now redirecting to Epic gardening and he's like I'd like the job like I'd like to put my hat in the ring for the job but I kind of have like a competing blog so to me I go look you've built that blog really fast way faster than our we're currently building ours but you kind of can't work for us and run that blog so what if we bought your blog and hired you to run on our blog and he goes okay and so what we did is we bought the blog and we migrated his blog into our blog which was like call them both like 10 million sessions a year something like that so you'd think like 10 plus 10 is 20 but our blog from an SEO perspective was like super strong so by migrating his into ours our blog went to like we probably got like a 20 30% premium on the traffic so like 10 plus 10 equals 25 right uh so then you're monetizing better off of the display ads there but then we also just made more from the ads themselves and so effectively the acquisition financed Itself by The increased Revenue like month one uh so that was another like sort of weird acquisition can you say was that more or less than 500 it was yeah it was it was in between 500 and a million and the way we structured that one is we paid some upfront and some over a period of time job plus Equity so post this was post churnin this is post churnin yeah so the way that one has ended up working out is we have a awesome leader running our blog at a higher level than ours was before our traffic has overd doubled and we're monetizing at overd Double the rate on the traffic so you know like like YouTube RPMs right it's the same with blogs like our our blog RPM doubled after doing the acquisition and so basically we just created like a cash flow that that finances the thing that we bought that created the cash flow did you read a book about this I mean how did you learn about Acquisitions like this I mean that's a pretty good one I just thought I don't know I just thought about it I was like if I do that I feel like all these things will happen and then they did I don't know like that my my whole like uh you're like look I don't make up the rules I just think them up and write them down I I don't know I just I I I well you know how like people say like there needs to be one re one like core reason to do something uh like a acquisition or a business move or whatever I I agree with that but to me I the way I mentally underwrote both of those things is I was like well the core reason is pretty obvious like I don't have a product now I do or like I don't have the traffic and a leader now I do but then I just go how many other ways could this benefit us and how many other ways could it hurt us and if the ways that could benefit us outweigh the ways that could hurt us I go like I feel like it'll just feel it'll just work then and this probably holds true for like Acquisitions that are smaller where it's maybe a less efficient market or something like that I don't know how it would work if if you have some sort of big big deal what was the third one cuz you're two for two you're two for two now that sounds pretty good those those ones work those ones have worked out yeah yeah so the the third one was almost like kind of a condition of doing the churn and deal in the first place because they were like look like this is this is not a big amount of money for us but we want to do some follow on and see if we can like purchase a really awesome company in the space and help power up epic gardening I was like okay cool that sounds good which is I think what they did with like meat eater uh and a few others where they buy like they buy the or they invest in the the media company and then immediately they're like let's go acquire a company to sell to the audience yeah yeah exactly and so we were looking man we looked at so many different companies like maybe 150 160 different companies in the space I was like out at a a fruit tree farm in Missouri at one point in time when you say look at 150 does that mean just like put like ideas on paper or does that mean actually contacting 150 people oh it means contacting more than 150 it it means like talking or like looking at a deck or inspecting in some way somewhere around 150 something like that I mean that's a [ __ ] ton of work yeah this is why this is why having them has has been helpful or having an investor on your side has been helpful because like I'm out here running the business and I I might mention a company and they'll they'll diligence and say like yeah this makes sense this doesn't make sense because and then they'll they'll cold email them or cold call them and be like hey this is who we are I know this is out of the blue but would this ever entertain you and then if they say yes and like look uh why don't you like put together some high level numbers and then um send something over and we could talk about it with our team and then you get some type of like docen or power you get something and you're like uh yay or nay like it could go to the next step let's actually have a real discussion about this is that is that how the diligence looks like pretty much yeah yeah pretty much like I I remember we we were looking at like the top 600 gardening apps at one point in time and so we I got like a sheet from uh one of the people on the investment team and they were like yeah here are like the seven we think make any sense whatsoever and here's like the 593 that don't make any sense at all so it's so these guys are doing a lot of the work then uh they're helping you oh yeah they're pulling their weight oh I think so yeah absolutely um so so anyway so the seed company this is like the big the big acquisition this was a company that without me knowing it it was the first pack of seeds I had ever grown when I first started gardening so I went into some random Nursery with my brother and just picked up like a beautiful packet of seeds these cucumber seeds and lo and behold turns out to be the seed company we end up buying in the story I'm about to share so we go out to Colorado it's this company called Botanical interests and they they're really well known for having high germination rates so the seeds sprout really well when you buy them but also the packet is just beautifully designed what are they growing uh you know I'm a Noob I'm a total Noob when it comes to this stuff what are they what's the out output there's six I think we we stock about 650 varieties of vegetables flowers and herbs so pretty much anything under the sun anything that you would like reasonably want to grow we we have it and it's a it's a husband and wife they've been running it for like 28 years they were married I think they had divorced like a few years prior to that and they were sort of ready to hand the business off to whoever wants to run it next but it you know it's so it's like one of those like quote boring businesses that people talk about all the time who's who's actually going to be able to buy it and the seed business is actually fairly complex there's a lot that goes into it that you have to understand and so we go out there I meet I meet the guy the husband and he's like hey can I grab a selfie like actually I have a friend who's like a big fan of your YouTube it'd be amazing if if I could show her that we met and immediately I'm like okay like maybe I've got a little Edge in this in this process like maybe I'm gon to be able to get this company it could go either way it could be like you haven't you have an edge or [ __ ] they know that they're that we have money behind us or something like that could be that too yeah it could be that too but we go through the whole like the diligence happens we go on a tour the place we're talking through pricing and all this sort of stuff and so I told my investors I was like they gave me all this swag they give me like a hat so I go I'm just going to wear this hat in every piece of content we make until we either win or don't win this deal because I know the guy watches it right and I know like probably his team watches it too so for the next like this was maybe May for the next six months which is a great time like May that's spring through summer I'm cranking YouTube videos out I'm cranking Instagram reels out short form whatever hat hats on 247 every single piece of content and we go through the bidding process we win the deal we were not the highest bid by like quite a bit I would say a material amount for the sellers to like not have in their pocket if they went with us and we go out to celebrate and I go hey you know I really appreciate you guys like it's it's truly an honor to be able to carry on the legacy of this company like this is the first seed packet I ever grew and I'm I'm just being very gracious because I I did feel that way and he goes you don't know how much wearing that hat helped and I go I knew it uh so yeah got him not in like a malicious way just like sure sure sure I'm using the angle that I have which is my everyone won everyone won everyone won did you uh what were some of the red flags and and I guess green flags or whatever it is that for that deal along with a few other deals when you're looking through the financials and the business so that the seed company's red flags are that it basically that it is a seed company like that's just a hard it's a difficult business like there's a ton so many different SKS tons of different SKS uh there's you have to do like a non-GMO certification you have to do germination testing you have to do pesticide and herbicide testing you're you're physically purchasing or Contracting a grower to to grow seeds that you then receive test repack Etc and so there's just like a lot of it's not like you're you're selling like a rug or something like that and you just buy rugs from China and then sell the rugs to other people in America so that was complex but the part that I think was really green about it is it was Far and Away one of the best brands in the space like I I loved it for 10 years and on top of that they were mostly a wholesale business and the online business they they sort of hadn't done a whole lot with and I was like okay well we're we're definitely an online first company media and product so why don't we just plug plug those two together and I think the first year after we we did the deal the online part of the business for the seed company is up like 70 60 or 70% year-over-year without really doing much like all we did was move it to Shopify and tell people we own the company now and that's pretty much it what what what payback cycle were you looking for and what type of multiple do businesses like this sell for man I I don't remember offhand the multiple but I want to say it was probably 6 to 8X somewhere like that uh income yeah I think so and how long until you could pay back the acquisition that's a good question I don't know maybe hopefully like hopefully like so I mean I I think that's pretty fast yeah it's like five I would say like five hopefully yeah I mean more I mean if you only if they only sell for five to seven times I would think that you you'd actually grow it or get that money back significantly faster I would think because of kind of like the audience that you have the audience and then like just the opportunity because we're we're we're carried in I would say 4,500 stores around the country and so to me I'm like well it's just seeds that are carried like just our seed Brands there because they were a seed company but we're making these trays that I told you about we're making these other new products we now we have a distribution Network so why don't we tell all those retailers hey look we're like making better product that your customers will want just stock our product in your store and so that was that was another like big lever I think we're still testing it out and trying to prove if if that's right or not but we're like yeah why wouldn't we just offer a ton of our products now to Wholesale in a network that we couldn't have built have you ever been to uh chip and Joann's like w like they like it's I did a show for them uh in 2020 like you were on their show I filmed a show for Magnolia back then they have uh it's basically like Disneyland for like four-year-old White Chicks uh it's like you could like buy anything in the world uh that your like for your home or living room uh I went to it once and like my uh mother-in-law and her sisters like wanted to go and like take pictures of like they just wanted to like anything with chip and Joann's name on it they just wanted to see it and I was like doing math around like how I mean it's like a it's like a it's like a campus and so they've got like food and uh many many different stores and I was doing math and I'm like these guys are going to be billionaires like this is gonna be this is goingon to be the greatest thing ever and that's going to happen to you because you've got the same stick where you're in a good uh niche of of I imagine it's mostly women uh and they probably have they probably spend a lot or just for the hobby they spend a lot but B you got the Charisma you got the look like like it's gonna happen do uh do you get crazy like stalker messages or like fans who are obsessed with you um it it's definitely happened yeah it's definitely people make fun of me on this podcast all the time part everyone thinks I'm gay cuz they like I comment on like men all the time yeah but you know I'm not embarrassed to say you're a charismatic good-looking dude I I imagine you've got you've got a lot of fans back at you dude we so everyone thinks I'm gay too actually just because I'm just because I'm a guy I think it's because I'm a a younger guy in gardening and gardening is seen as a more feminine hobby uh people just think I'm a gay guy which it's just it's just an interesting phenomenon to experience on the internet all the time but um yeah no I mean I would say it it happens for sure it I I've done the whole like delete all your info from the internet process but it's kind of hard it's never good enough it's never good enough especially when you film at your home right like my set is my outdoors and so I can't like not show the street Etc because it's it's just in the shot there's nothing I can really do about it dude I've had times where like I took a picture of my house and I didn't think you could see it and then like the next couple days I'll get gifts sent to my home and like people will find it on like street view and I'm like a [ __ ] and like I'm not a famous person I'm a mildly popular person in a small subset of the internet and so I can't imagine if you're like real famous or if I'm like you and my videos get millions and millions and millions of views yeah yeah I mean look it's it's hasn't been as bad as I think like legitimate celebrity type people but I've definitely had like I had an experience earlier this year where this woman we're all in the backyard because that's where we film most of the time but there's a garden in the front yard too and I have security cameras on now that record like locally to my house so I can pull up footage of whatever I want and this woman like comes up the front door knocks on it says Yoohoo and then like looks in the house and then goes out into the front gate walks opens it like kind of messes around with some plants tries to walk around the backyard and my assistant was in the backyard she's like coming around the back to the front so they kind of like buted heads and my assistant just freaked out she's like who is this woman and this woman saw nothing wrong with what she was doing she was like oh yeah I just wanted to see if you guys were filming like wanted to come say hi and we're like we don't know who you are and she like there's nothing we could have said to her that would have made her understand her behavior was like completely out of the norm and so every so often it's like the law of large numbers man like if you have an audience of many millions all you need is 0.001% and that's still like 14 people you know that'll come mess mess with you you were telling Ari before about something that I wanted to ask you about and this is something that I've been crazy interested in it's a business I don't really know much about other than listening to like two or three podcasts and reading a couple articles but uh the like licensing of uh fruits or vegetables or different type of seeds so like I was reading about the history of honey crisp apples and I believe it was started in either I think it was Minnesota like University of Minnesota what they did was I think they like took two plants and they bred them however that people even do that I don't even know how you do that but it took like many decades because I guess it takes a year to get a new plant or I guess it takes like 10 years to get an apple tree in the first place or five years something like that and then you screw up a bunch and then so it ultimately will take many years sometimes decades to get like a good apple and then they come up with a really cute name like honey crisp or like I think I had one the other day that was called like uh cotton a cotton candy apple like you like brand it with some like cute name and then you license it out to other other farmers and you build this massive business that has this moat that will take 30 years to disrupt is that how it work am I do I have that right with that's pretty much right that's pretty much right so we're going to go into like Garden nerd territory for a sec just so I could explain how it works so when you're making a new tree it's it's really difficult like you mentioned like actually when you're making new varieties of most plants it's it it's super painful to get the variety that you actually want like I met a guy at a farm once he'd been working on a potato for like 20 years and what was his uh goal outcome for that potato so the goal outcome potatoes are are grown from what are called seed potatoes which is basically just just a potato that you throw in the ground so you don't plant like a little seed you just throw potato in the ground so this guy was trying to make a potato that you could grow from an actual potato seed because when a potato is in the ground it throws like leaves up and it actually makes a potato flour which produces a potato Berry and that Berry has seeds in it and if you plant those seeds the problem is that you don't get the potato that you planted you get so his outcome was like a more efficient way for a farmer it wasn't necessarily a certain taste yeah it was it wasn't it I mean it definitely was a taste but you're right like the idea was instead of buying a ton of potatoes and planting them by hand you could just plant a bunch of seeds that took him that took him 20 years right did he get his out did did it did he do it he got it yeah it's called the Clancy potato we actually sell it on our our store it's an awesome potato did he get wealthy from it I hope so I didn't ask but I hope so I think he did it under a seed company so probably they got wealthy I'm not sure but either way it's in guy so with fruit trees though it's kind of the same thing where like you have to you have to keep developing tons and tons of trees and then figure out let's say okay this is the Apple out of the hundreds that I grew out that I actually like it's that's my next honey crisp right and what you then do is you you have to graft you have to take a piece of that tree and put it on What's called the root stock of of an Apple so like the roots and Below cuz you can't use the seed of that because it'll be a different apple and it will take a long time so let's say you you get this magical new honey crisp uh what you do is you take a bunch of those those little branches off and you put them on other apple root stock and then grow those out and then those are genetic clones of that new honey crisp and then you do that again and then you do that again and so that's how and is each time one year or how long does it take to grow a tree it's probably like it would really depend on the type of fruit but it it it's probably it I'll say this it'll shorten from growing from seed by like 70 80% it's like way faster than growing it from seed not only that it you you have to do it that way because you won't get the same genetic apple and so what what guys like the honey crisp guy you mentioned or there there's a guy named Floyd zagger who's who's sort of known as like the Godfather of stone fruit which is like peaches nectarines all those types of of trees what they do is they have tens of thousands I think of trees that they're cross-pollinating growing out grafting in testing and then when maybe .1% of those actually become a variety they now have a patent on that because they've developed that what's called a cultivar they have that cultivar and then they can license that out for other people that put into production they take like a licensing fee on all those so you're right like once they actually create the next honey crisp or the next like killer Peach they can make a cash flow off of that thing for like who knows how long until the next one comes around I'm looking at this guy Floyd so he's 94 years old it looks like he's still doing it I think I think he passed away like a couple years ago but he's like a total legend in the space Oh yeah you're right he he passed away but it looked like based off the photos up until like when he passed away it looks like he was still yeah planting or or involved did he build a big his name of his company was uh Z Zager genetics is that right yeah zagger genetics and then what what there's a nursery called Dave Wilson Nursery which I think they sell the most fruit trees in the US they use a lot of zagger stuff uh and so they'll they'll be the people who grow out a lot of Floyd zigger's actual trees U so it's it's a crazy model because you're right like good luck competing you you have to spend like 20 years to even get started does it make does it make is it like a good business or is it something that looks awesome but day-to-day it's quite challenging I mean I don't think it's the easiest business you have to know a lot about plant botney and genetics and all that but like the people who like this type of stuff like there's nothing you could pay them to make them stop doing it so they might as well have a business based on it you know yeah my parents are in the agriculture industry so my uh father his first business was a fruit stand on the he started as a stock boy in like the produce section of a grocery store then he opened up a Fruit Stand and then he created a produce brokerage which is like a basically you have relationships with farmers and Idaho or Bakersfield California and you buy let's say $500,000 of onions and then you go and find a trucker to pick it up and then you sell that $500,000 of onions to Walmart for five $500,000 $50,000 and you make like 10 grand of profit or something like that off organizing that that deal and you have to sell at this point he's sold over $ hundred million of of onions over the course of 20 years but the margins are like 3% or like like like you know it'll be basically him by himself selling 20 million a year worth of produce and like you make I don't know what you make but like $300,000 a year so a good living but like you've got to sell a [ __ ] ton of product in order because the the the margins are so small uh and so I've grown up talking to some of these farmers and it's it's it's uh it's more of a vocation than anything because it's just what they know you know they've been born and raised doing that and it's like I I am a farmer uh no matter what and it's not like maybe traditional businesses where it's like I see an opportunity I'm going to do this it's like no this is just what I was bred to be that's what I've noticed in in our space because there's a lot of like smaller product companies or small seed companies Etc like no one's no one's trying to get super rich doing it like even even me like back in the earlier days I was like I I just I'm very happy making that 250 that I made gross revenue and pulling out whatever I made it just so happened that I also like business uh and so they combined really well can I uh and we'll wrap up here in a second but I want to ask you a quick question about uh diet I'm I'm a little I'm recently moved to a new place just mostly because it was across the street from a farmers market and I've been obsessed with the idea of buying produce and uh meat that only comes within like a 20 or 50 mile radius of where I am um because like even if you buy food at Whole Foods I still think like Whole Foods is supposed to be like some type of standard which I don't think it is the standard anymore but for a long time it was like that was the standard of healthy eating um but I still feel crappy after I eat that because I don't you know like I don't even know what organic actually means and I don't actually bind to the height necessarily that that makes that is the right way to do things are you eating all of your own food and do you think that makes you feel different than grocery store food I think I think for sure it does because I don't know that I believe you know that book blue zones remember that one that came out it's like D I think that that that book is awesome but I think it's [ __ ] like I I think a good part of it is [ __ ] yeah you know why it's [ __ ] so here well I'll tell the audience I did a little research on it it's like what they all have in common is that uh like in Osaka Japan or uh like they lie about their age and so like they notice that like wow this in this town There's a [ __ ] ton of people born on January 1st like what's going on and it turns out a lot of them lie about their age I guess so they get Social Security at a certain time or something like that oh wow uh and so there was a lot like the the the the although maybe he there was some bit of Truth in there the commonality between the five blue zones is that they have a huge amount of like age fraud I also saw something about can you imagine like lying to be older uh I saw something about like it also maps to when we started accurately tracking birth certificates like a lot of these people are old enough that they're from before when we did that and so how can you really know how old they are the thing I do that's that's the nicer way to put it what I maybe said yeah yeah yeah well I think the thing that is somewhat true there is like it does seem to just make logical sense that the fresher food you eat the better off you'll be and so to me I go well it doesn't get fresher than out of my own backyard right like we just had a amazing carrot salad we made yesterday I've even grown my own wheat to make my own sourdough bread which is definitely extreme like I don't think that's practical but yeah I mean I think you do feel better and I think the best the next best thing to Growing your own food would be going to like a farmers's market as long as you know like the farmer is actually growing things the way that they say they are because now there's like Farmers Market fraud because down here in San Diego people will drive up from Mexico with like monocropped food and just pretend like it's a farmers market what questions do I have to ask them you would have to ask like well where is your farm which they could definitely about show me pictures yeah yeah they should have pictures of it and you could ask like you know do you spray pesticide herbicide fungicide if so like which ones you don't even have to know what their answers mean but if they can't fire the answers off quickly that's your signal that they kind of don't know what they're talking about what do you do for meat meat I tend to just buy at um I I'll go to like a Whole Foods or there's like a local fish market called Point Loa Seafoods down here in San Diego I'll try to go to and sometimes so I'm trying to get like some friends to do that like quarter cow thing with me so far so far no one's down so if you're out there all around me I've been trying to do that as well uh you need like a huge garage fridge which is how you know you made it by having a garage fridge to like store all this meat uh but I've been doing it too have you seen um uh it's called uh it's called Coupe but if you Google like coup oh yeah yeah yeah we had them on our podcast smart Farm yeah M yeah AJ's a good buddy of mine AJ's awesome um what's his URL I want to give him a shout out uh cp. farm coupe. farm so Coupe is like it's like they like the tagline that I saw in article was like it's like the Tesla for chicken Coupe and it's a so coupe. Farm it's like a smart chicken Coupe um and it looks pretty cool I think I might get one um I think it'd be awesome to have your own chickens uh because that's like a pretty low maintenance uh way to kind of get into the habit or get in the hobby the other thing that I've done for years is uh be keeping um so I've raised my own bees um in order to get honey uh which is like an awesome Hobby and beekeeping is a cool thing because it requires like not much maintenance as at all and from a business perspective you remember that Flo Hive or whatever that went viral a Kickstarter and it raised like $20 million I do think that uh beekeeping like the the supplies could actually be a legitimately good business um and you could create like because you can create like a a a Lifestyle brand around it because the content to around that is like inherently quite viral like I used to create these like just videos of me like uh scraping off the honey or the uh what's it called the um honey honey from com yeah like scraping the comb off of my uh uh my trays or whatever that's in the hive I don't actually know anything about it even though I've had bees for years but like That's how little you have to know about this in order to like successfully do it like I would like scrape off the comb and like make these awesome videos and then just like give it to my friends and they loved it and it it's like such a fun hobby and so I'm really big on that named I think her name is like Texas B works I don't know if you've seen her stuff on the internet but she has this like very soft pleasing voice and she'll be like there'll be music and it'll be some crazy scenario where there's a hive and she's like called out and she goes I've been called out to take this Hive out of a manhole dude she has a mill 1.6 million Subs on YouTube oh yeah yeah she's huge and so I I always look cuz I know what I did with heic and I look at all these other people and I go like don't you realize like you could have a thriving beekeeping like goods company but then you know the the sort of paradox of the whole Creator world is that most creators just don't want to do that and that's why they don't do it dude she was on Joe Rogan I'm looking at it now Erica Thompson she was on Joe Rogan she goes I did my first podcast and it's it's Joe Rogan it's Joe Rogan she goes I did my first podcast Link's in the bi thank you so much Joe Rogan and team this was such a wonderful experience for me and my bees damn that's a flex right there that's a flex awesome this this is a this is a gem this woman uh she's got it um yeah man beekeeping is a good uh is an interesting hobby you you should try it out you like it requires no work and I'm pretty sure it makes your plants way better I notic that whenever I get be whenever I get bees you start seeing like all different types of flowers uh in the backyard that's the last thing I haven't done like I've got the chickens I've got it all the Pond you know I don't have bees yet so I might have to get some bees dude it cost like $200 to start like like my hives are from Amazon for 200 bucks and then you go on Craigslist and you find like a be delivery person uh the lady that I used was this like beautiful like Eastern European woman she shows up in her Lexus she pops out with an Hive she's not wearing any mask she's got like a fancy watch on and like beautiful blond hair and nice clothes and she just goes like you know I've got your bees and I was like yes ma'am please come put over here and uh I paid her $200 for the bees and then $200 for the hive that I got on Amazon and that's all that's all I needed you right now uh I recently moved uh but up until recently yeah I had them on the I had them in San Francisco and I had them in Texas but in San Francisco I had them at my small little house uh I had a backyard and then I also had them on the roof of my office in downtown San Francisco and I had about 10,000 bees and you wouldn't even you could your hive could be like 30 feet away and you wouldn't even know that it's there yeah uh it's like a pretty self-contained thing it's a I've got a spot for my hive then I have the perfect spot in my backyard for my hive yeah and like I think I like I don't even know what I'm talking about and I have them and like I got I got stung I've been stung like twice like it's like not like that big of a deal like like people think it's a very intimidating unapproachable hobby but I got into it because I like made a list of like I was like I need a hobby that doesn't require a ton of work uh I it can't cost a ton of money because if it costs a ton of money I'm going to break r number three which is I can't turn it into a business to make money and so like I like and I was like what's a good hobby and then I saw a bird spe documentary and I was like that's a good hobby let's do it so and um AJ's a buddy of mine and uh he got me into beekeeping as well yeah yeah I'm excited to see how that c that smart coup business does it's a really cool design um well thanks for doing this dude you're the man uh you're uh you uh you're going to be fun to watch over the next like five years this is going to a very exciting journey I um we take pride on having people on before they like write the beginning of their like takeoff and even though you you're already incredibly successful I have a feeling that this is still going to be early in your journey and and we're going to brag about having you on early in your career that's awesome dude well thanks for having me I appreciate it all right that's the pod [Music]

there is a little concern for me of what happens when this no longer becomes the remote control of our society I'm very fascinated by 20 years from now talk about 16 years ago on Tumblr if you told me that 16 years from now we live in a predominant VR world I would be like maybe like I can see that possibility you could see that it's pushing in a direction I don't think it's going to end up being these Apple Pro Google Glass snap the Facebook thing Quest my intuition is that it's going to have to be much more lightweight but I never underestimate the human being I'm positive somebody's going to make the contact lenses that work like this and then We're Off to the Races cuz now back to the way I think about day trading attention this no longer houses the attention now it's housed here whoever controls that Paradigm wins Big

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right everyone so I did this podcast for me and I'm going to explain why today's guest is this guy named Jack Carr if you don't know who jack cars you guys should look him up but basically he has this series of books called the terminal list terminal list is now a it's definitely a bestselling book they've sold millions and millions of copy it's a novel about a Navy SEAL who's wronged and then there's like eight books of him getting revenge and it's an Amazon Prime show with Chris Pratt it's awesome however I had Jack Carr on the podcast because I read his book when I was going through a little bit of a period where I had just had a daughter and I wanted to do something where I would become a little bit more of a man than before I wanted to learn something about high integrity about things I should be doing as a man and it just kind of honestly changed my life and it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman I think you're going to enjoy this episode we talk a lot about his writing process but we mostly talk about the process of masculinity and what it means to be a standup person we talked about the business of writing books and how he makes money I think you're going to enjoy this one it's a little bit out of left feel but try it out I uh I love this guy so check it [Music] out so I'm happy you're here man we um this is a business show and so like we don't do like authors and stuff like that all the time but I published a podcast where I was talking about how I loved your books and I I'm halfway through the third one and the reason I found you guys uh or I I found you um is because I tweeted out I want to read a book that's the ultimate man novel something that is action adventure page turning high integrity like teaches you values because I just had a kid and I was like I I want to be inspired a little bit and all these people were tagging you and saying Jack Carr and I was like I've never heard of Jack car I don't know I don't know anything about this what is this all about and I started reading the terminal list and I read the first book and I was hooked and I'm so hooked I'm on uh I'm halfway through number three and I'm going to make it through all through seven and uh you I I think you actually are like a lot more business savvy than most authors if I had to guess it's it's more entrepreneurial than uh I think there's a difference between being entrepreneurial and being business-minded which is why at some point your gr startups eventually sell or bring in a business person to run it and professionalize it and scale it and that sort of a thing um but I didn't really think of myself that way and about I'd say a month before the F first book came out so I'm all into the novel leaving the SEAL Teams and just writing because I love it my mom is a librarian so I grew up surrounded by books and a love of reading as you can tell from the the background here I have quite the quite the collection always been a reader and it's the foundation from which everything else has grown and so it's all about the book and then about a month maybe two before first book publication in March of 2018 I was like oh okay I'm going to look at this the way I looked at the battlefield you Iraq and Afghanistan meaning you are looking for gaps in the enemy's defenses you're looking how to adapt how to capitalize on momentum and I just looked at the space in general and I was like oh wow publishing really hasn't kept up it's a very it's a very Legacy type of a business and they do so well because they've been around for so long so they're very entrenched in what they do and they make some money but they're safe as far as business goes very slow to adapt to things even like audiobooks or ebooks that sort of that thing so I looked at it and I was like okay why when I get my uh iPhone it doesn't just come in a manila envelope it comes in packaging and as much thought went into that packaging as went into the actual product itself and when I was getting books from other authors for blurbs or that sort of a thing they were just coming in these manila envelopes yeah you you send these like amazing gift boxes one of my one of my really close friends is Richard Ryan and I went to his house he's so awesome I went to his house and I saw like boxes that you send to people I told I go I told Richard I go after this pod I'm G to try to make Jack like me so much that he sends me one of these boxes I got your names your names on one of this for the next one so it's a gun case and it has the book does it have anything else in it yep so it's uh you open this thing up and it's kind of a way to make people who want to help you make it easy for them like if i s Sprat maybe he has time to open it maybe he doesn't but if he does then this makes it easy for him to do a 15sec something to help you know so awesome bookmark that has the leather bookmark all super high quality stuff because everything has to be that commensurate level as the novel itself so everything I do has to be like right here like we talked about you guys talked about your site merch on the site it's not just a glass where you go to some company and like pick keychain pick hat pick mug it's like those are handpicked by me and they're all the best you can possibly find or the best that I can possibly find I try to do made in America not always possible try to Veer towards veteran owned businesses but book is in there inside the book is personalized to the person and then they have stickers there's three stickers you personalized all of them personalize all of them how many of those did you send out I send out about 350 and most of them go to people as just thank yous they're so people with no social media Presence at all just a thank you for whatever X Y or Z someone who helped me with research on a novel uh this one someone helped me with some aircraft stuff because I'm not a pilot so he'll get one um some fans that were with me from the very beginning they get they get them and then people like Chris Bratt get them and and uh and he gets the same one as as everybody else but the coin goes in there and a coin different coin with every single awesome and you can't buy these and I know you talked about um on that that podcast where you talked about me and James Patterson you uh you also uh talked about the momento Mor coins I don't sell these um you should it should but to if I want for if you were to make some money on them but for me right and I'm not saying I never will because people ask me to sell them all the time but I have to give you one so that's kind of the thing with these is I have to a book signing law enforcement military firefighter somebody they they coin you and they have this in their hand and they shake your hand and then I have these in my back pocket and I coin him back I want to talk about the economics and all this stuff but how do how do I introduce you to people so like I was thinking about this I was like well so Jack writes these books that s uh the the oneline summary is basically uh a Navy SEAL who's wronged and he goes and gets revenge involving family country and a bunch of Adventure it's a seven or eight book series now it's a Amazon Prime show starring Chris Pratt but the cool thing about the book you do a bunch of interesting interesting but it's like a huge hit and when I was on Amazon it has like 100,000 Plus reviews across all the books something like that can you say how many copies have you sold so far you know I don't know because I don't keep track of those things and this is where the entrepreneurial side versus the business side comes in that we talked about at the beginning is I spent zero bandwidth worried about that so my my metric is is and Shuster happy and how happy are they and they're estatic so that is my Millions I would assume yeah it's up there yeah is it uh do you think it's north of 10 million no so that's just a guess I don't know but I think they tell me if it was north of 10 million it's up there um I think we had um I'm I'm friendly with James clear and Mark Manson and I think that they have some of the bestselling books of the last like maybe decade but I would imagine I would imagine that after a few more years you're going to be up there because you you were a Navy SEAL which you've talked a bunch about but you started writing but the books are relatively new right yeah so 2018 I started writing the first one when I was still in as I was getting out of the military so I think December of 2014 I wrote my first words to the first book so they they came out 2018 and then there's been one a year ever since and this is the first year with two books so I have my newest one the seventh book in the series Red Sky morning comes out in June and then I have my first non-fiction that comes out in September so September 24th and that's on the 1983 beay Barracks bombing and you probably noticed I weave a lot of history into the as well that's why I liked it so much you know I'm reading uh looming Towers right now and I typically read American history that's what my audience knows me for and that's why I wanted to read yours and what's weird is a lot of uh I think without giving away there's talk of a virus there's talk of Ukraine before any of this stuff was even a thing yeah that was crazy so the book with Ukraine came out in 2019 uh so I was writing it before writing actually before I sent the first novel to samon Schuster um I didn't have a publishing deal but I always knew I was going to write two books because of the John Grisham story he wrote A Time to Kill first and he could not give that book away and then he writes The Firm that takes off it's the movie with Tom Cruz and we've had a John Grisham legal thriller every year s you you you've got a good track record at the moment for like predicting a handful of things well I hope this next one doesn't count true us this next one's pretty brutal so I hope this next one does not predict the future all right everyone really quick if you've heard this podcast before you know that sea and I think that the most important skill set you need in business is copyrighting and so what we did was we went through all of the podcasts that we've done it's like 500 of them and we found all the best copywriting tips our resources our Frameworks our templates we aggregated all of them into one simple document so you can skim it all and get everything that we've ever talked about with copywriting it's in the link below it's awesome check it out what did you I know that uh you're writing you're talking about like finding an agent and things like that and you're like I didn't even know you needed an agent I think he read like Steven pressfield to like learn a little bit about the publishing process but what did what would you have defined as uh a success like when you were first starting because I imagine now you you've made millions of dollars you're famous your books are loved it's a movie I know that you originally before Chris Pratt was even a movie star he was just a Parks and Rec guy you like Chris Pratt's the guy so like you've kind of manifested all this but what would you have defined as success like 10 years ago you know personal or professional different different sides but uh for me growing up I'm reading all these books they all say number one New York Times bestselling author on the cover so I'm reading Tom Clancy uh I'm reading Nelson de Mill I'm reading AJ Kile JC Pollock Mark Olden Louis lore all these guys who are like my professors in The Art of Storytelling but at the top of each one of those paperbacks and I think I have a tie have a top glassy one somewhere here but it says number one New York TI best Ling author so in my head from age well let's say 11 so sixth grade when I start reading all the same types of books my parents are reading from fifth grade it's kind of that transition time from young adult type fiction to the same types of books that I'm reading and writing today uh they all said that and so in my head at that age knowing that I wanted to write in the future just like I knew that I wanted to be a Navy SEAL from age seven onward that I I didn't think of it in terms of hey this is Success once I do this but that was like a benchmark that's funny that was your goal because I think in the same podcast you said you listened to uh for MFM we talked about this guy I don't remember his name but basically he self-published a book and he got really popular on Goodreads and I think on Goodreads collectively he also had hundreds of thousands uh of reviews and from reading your books I wouldn't call you anti-establishment but there's like some subcontext there of like don't trust too many people and whatever I would have not thought that you'd give a about New York Times and more so just do lots of people love this and does this create like Financial Freedom and and like spiritual wh Ness for you you know what I'm saying like if you could like make if you could feel good and and make money that would be the win not New York Times yeah well The New York Times like you know like when you see a book that says uh number one or just like uh USA Today bestseller what that tells me and what has always told me is that they didn't make the New York Times list uh so New York Times list is kind of a benchmark because you can be a number one something on Amazon in pretty much anything um so I knew that that that's not my I'm never going to say that I think the the uh publisher for the first or second book they put something like that somewhere and I was like take that down I don't want that in my calculus that's not that's not me for me like leaving the military the things that were important I think it's important to articulate that uh no matter what it is guys we're all going to go through transitions in life whether it's uh professional transition death of a loved one divorce whatever it might be but you're going to move on and do something else change change jobs and for me it was Financial freedom and being able to control my schedule and I knew I wanted to write I've knew from a very early age that after my time in the military I would write Thrillers just like I'm writing today were you writing uh books from an early age so yeah always a writer so at any time we're having an English English class in in high school that's what I gravitated towards um read the most dangerous game which is a short story that came out in 1924 heavily inspired uh your book three I assume exactly exactly that's my and so in six grade I said one day I'm going to write a novel it's tribute to that short story and that's Savage son the one that you're on right now so it's uh so it it's uh so I was writing but I wasn't writing throughout my time in the military I was reading so I'm always reading and I'm reading both non-fiction and fiction so I'm always just got there's never been a time when I haven't had a book in my hand or know what I'm going to read next there's a bunch of jokes I'm friends with a bunch of uh seal guys and um there's a joke that like many of them want to write a book uh because you guys experience such like crazy lives um but there are like some actually interesting people doing stuff uh the creative space uh so obviously you and then we know Joo and and people like that but then there's Mr Ballin do you follow Mr Ballin no I know who he is but I've never never met him and I haven't watched any of his uh stuff yet but I know who he is I so Mr Ballin I listen to all of his stuff so Mr ballan um started I think as a YouTube page and he was basically like just telling scary 10 and 20 minute stories of True Crimes and I don't know how he managed to do this because but I mean he's a great delivery uh he he delivers his stories wonderfully so I guess it's it's it's it's uh clear how he kind of figured it out but now it's like this massive thing he's got millions and millions of subscribers in Austin near where I live he's got a billboard now where he's got this deal with Audible and it's like pretty amazing that uh this guy's pulled this off he doesn't pull too many details from his his military days but it is like interesting to see some of these like ex seal guys or seal guys like tell some of these like interesting and be creative because when I think of you guys I think of like a tough guy I don't think of like an artistic guy do you know what I mean yeah well on the battlefield you have to be creative and I think that's something that really was what made us successful in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places around the world over the last 20 years that we were at War engaged in those places is being able to be creative and be very be creative very quickly and be aggressive problem solvers um so now I can be an aggressive Problem Solver but you know what if I make a mistake no one's coming home in a body bag and I can sleep on it and I can come back to something in a month which is why when I do the outlines for these books and I get to a place where I'm like oh how's James Reese going to get out of this one I don't let it stall me out I know that I have a year to figure this out because it's one book a year so it takes about the whole process takes about a year but uh I don't get stuck there I know that I'm GNA figure it out we're on the battlefield you're making split-second decisions um that are going to impact people's lives forever if you make the wrong one there's this amazing book called made to stick I read made to stick in 2008 or 2010 it's awesome it's by I think his name is I think it's the heath Brothers out of Stanford and it's a whole book about how to make ideas stick and there's like six or eight principles and one example they give is um uh like if I told you uh a a movie theater popcorn had 100 grams of fat that doesn't really mean anything but if I got 100 gram of fat and I showed that butter and like you could grab it or if I showed you like a black smoker's lung then it's an easier way to understand and remember an idea um one thing that the book says is they uh talk about the demise of local newspapers and they tell a story about this guy in North Carolina who's got a thriving local newspaper and they go hey Will what's your what's your deal what's your secret with this newspaper and he goes names names and names it's simple if I could print the Yellow Pages I would all I want to do is name as many local people and their friends as possible in their newspaper in my newspaper because people will buy it more to see their friends and family and themselves something you do in your book and this is what I talked about in the last podcast and what what I thought was Savvy is you name so many products like it's to the point now where I'm I have a a notification on my bring a trailer profile to see a Land Cruiser because I want to buy a I want to buy a Land Cruiser I know all about Land Cruisers I just bought someone just I talked about that on the podcast someone just sent me one of your uh or not one of yours but a hatchet I'm looking at like Hill people like fanny packs you like name all of this stuff where I'm like I didn't even know I need this pair of sunglasses but because Jame Reese is using this sunglass like I want it or like Black Rifle coffee on friends with Richard Ryan one of the founders you name Black Rifle coffee all the time you talk about a I think his name is a uh Reef he has this leather type of boot that's a little bit more sophisticated than James Reese's because he's a more of a a Suave type of guy and I find myself Googling this stuff and I noticed on your website you list many of the stuff so it's like James Reese's like daily wear in book one or or the guns planes cars and and supplies in book two do you monetize that well no I've been a gear guy in my entire life and I should monetize people like assume that you are like right from the get-go but I don't know at the beginning I knew I knew some of those Brands because I'm just friends with them from getting that gear to go down range with in the SEAL Teams and that sort of a thing um but not all of them it's just stuff that I use but I have no personal connection to the the company but it added a a personal not an authentic element so if you're a law somebody in law enforcement or a firefighter intelligence agent or you know military and you're reading this thing and you can be reading a book and it can just say he picked up the shotgun he picked up the pistol but doesn't tell me anything about the character yet when I see somebody and they walk in or they walk onto a range I can see the pistol that they have on I can see the holster they're using the belt their shoes their hat their watch that tells me a story about them the car they pull up in that all tells me something that's giving me information uh and so same thing in these books and I think if you if you spend let's say 20 years in the seel teams or special forces or whatever it is then you're reading a book and it says Hey the main protagonist has a background similar to yours but he's and it says what he's carrying and you're like oh man we would never carry something like that like this doesn't make any sense this person obviously doesn't know what they're writing about and so then that impacts their story in general so it's uh it's a way to to add authenticity and tell a story about that person because sometimes I'll use brands that uh that it says this person doesn't know what they're doing and that tells that reader who's in law enforcement or military ah it tells me something about this guy's character even before he's describe before he even opens his mouth uh and so I so I love using those brands that way so I haven't monetized it the way people think that probably I have by looking at the website because I put together gear guides for each book and I have a Father's Day gear guide and a holiday gear guide and that sort of thing and I link out and a few of them have affiliate links there's an Amazon affiliate link I don't really think it makes I have no idea if it makes any money or not actually um but it's more for the fun of it and also to help a lot of those companies like better owned businesses like this is a way for me to give back and offer a helping hand yeah and I get that for like a small business but there's many businesses that you mentioned or brands that aren't small and your website gets traffic and I'm like why wouldn't you monetize that you know like there's um gearjunkie.com there's uh uh gear Patrol there's uh Steve rell's company me eater and they have turned these into like big businesses of merchandise or Affiliates what is stop because I know you're entrepreneurial what's stopping you from turning this into like a legitimate Media Company beyond what most authors do I thought the first hesitation was uh that I wanted it to remain remain authentic I didn't want anyone to ever be able to say people are going to say it anyway but it I don't want it to be true that hey all of a sudden he had this one p St in there and all of a sudden he switched how much are they paying him to put that in there and the answer is0 uh the answer is always Z people have reached out and said how much how can I how much do you need to put my product on your your gear guide and the answer is nothing what do you think uh an author like you if you wanted to do it which you don't but I bet it happens what would you have what would a brand charge I don't even know and at some point maybe it might turn into to something like that where it's a little more more obvious and there's like the P my podcast is something that that gets sponsored um and has the ads on it but those are obvious SP totally and that's separate and there's never anything attached to that that says you're going to do any of these posts on social media and you're going to do this in the gear guide and you're gonna put it in the book or you're gonna put in the show uh so none of that exists um and I I want to keep it pure like that but I saw the podcast as a way to semi monetize a little bit of those some of those relationships because they want to help anyway they want to be Associated have this podcast that uh is a way that authors couldn't reach an audience 20 30 40 years ago um so once again looking at that battle space I looked at it at well James Patterson he's been around as you did your research since the 70s uh Stephen King 70 so there's a reason that those names on the New York Times list that are at the top are the same names that our parents would have opened the New York Times bestseller list and seen back in the 80s 90s so it's uh I I realized that hey what can I do today to create new readers because those authors that have been around for so long they have a reader base that they have built up over 30 40 years uh I have I have not done that and there's more distractions today so back then let's say 70s 80s you have a book that's competing with maybe television and possibly film so those are three things a newspaper a magazine that's that's about it so now when I'm stepping into this space now I'm competing with all those other distractions and all those other products and platforms streaming every single streaming service every single app every single social media all internet everything out there plus the movies and TV shows still um so I real realiz that if you want to build an audience today with new readers well now it's podcast it's social presence it's that blog it's adding something of value to their lives throughout the year that they're not paying for um but that helps create that connection yeah another guy who does that well is a friend of mine who I'd imagine you're friendly with him too is Ryan holiday so Ryan does a really good job I don't know how his output is so high because he's always has a book that he's doing I think he has maybe two daily emails for sure one he has a business selling merch and coins and things like that and then he has a bookstore I don't know how his uh output so high as a podcast and then uh you have a bunch of stuff you got the site you got the newsletter social media you got your podcast you're always on other people's podcast um how big's your team it was me until uh this last fall and then I got a chief of staff with no staff and she's she's amazing and then starting in February we started adding to the team so this is my first year of putting a team together and I was writing this last book I thought it was going to be first I thought it was going to be finished December 1st and then January 1 and then February first it ended up being the longest book here it's actually it's uh it ended up being the longest book to date because you just don't know when you start like I thought I had a pretty good idea seventh book like I it'll be about 115 120,000 words it ended up being like 150,000 words uh which is adds months to the writing process so I started hiring some people to help but I didn't really get to interact with with him at all until about two weeks ago when I finally sent my final edits in uh for the good anom so it's uh so now the team is as of yesterday six um but it's very new very new H how are you balancing being a writer or a Creator and also a manager is that a pain I mean it's I think it sucks yeah well to this point it's been just me my wife like she was doing all the Fulfillment you know our boxes all over our bedroom all over the the living room like just chaos um and I realized early on that I needed help but you're not yet to a place financially where it makes sense to do that so it's just been me essentially startup in the garage making a computer in 1976 1977 building all the parts also letting people know it exists why they need it uh and doing every being the CEO the CFO the CMO uh the Creator being every single piece uh now and as of yesterday I hired six person yesterday to handle the Hollywood side of the house because there's multiple projects in Hollywood now and I was doing all the calls all the writing all the creative everything no you are doing that by yourself so no each one has a team and as each project and a lot of some haven't been announced yet um but you're putting together a team of a showrunner director a lead uh production Team all those things um and you're essentially putting together this package then to take to to Netflix usually through another production company that you have a relationship with so there's multiple of those going on right now so I'm jumping between um either writing a script writing a uh writing a uh executive summary writing an outline doing a creative back and forth to see if someone is the right person to be a showrunner uh for the show or be a lead writer on a show for a new idea and then I'm jumping back in because I have a deadline on my novel and I'm doing that and then I have to jump over to the podcast I how are you dealing with that context switching because that's that's a that's really hard yeah no well yesterday I had my a call with the person I brought on to run the Hollywood side of the house and I I told them I'm like I need to do prioritize and execute I need to be focused on one thing at a time and then switch to the next one there'll be a little bit of overlap there as you're editing or coming up generating some new ideas but for the most part I need to be focused on one thing at a time and then switch gears and I know you do something cool so you uh you write I think I heard on your podcast you like to write a one pager and you write a one pager I think we're you didn't exactly explain what's on the one pager but I imagine it's like an a summary of the book but maybe there's more to it like my goal is that it sells this many copies or it makes a reader feel like this but you said uh I do this one pager because I know that this project I'm going to spend 18 minutes of my life and I want to make sure that like I'm willing to do that and I think that's kind of cool because when you know running a business tends to actually probably go into three or five year Cycles but I thought it was pretty cool that writing this one pager you know Amazon does this thing where they go we're going to create this product go ahead and write the press release now so we know like what do we want it to say in 24 or 12 months when this product is live what how do we want it to be received what do we want to tell people it do it does and then let's work backwards to creating that and that's sort of like what you're doing and I thought that was pretty interesting and I try to do that with a bunch of projects in my life whether it be like a fitness challenge that I have or a business or whatever like a new life event where it's like what's what's the outcome going to be like this in 12 or 18 months and and do I really want to go all in on that and I thought that was cool you do that yeah I didn't know that about Amazon but it makes total sense so I do that I write it's it's like it's kind of like what you'd find on the back of a in a on the back of a paperback or in the front flap of a of a book you know something that describes it so it's about a one one pager and it's like a executive summary and then I read it to myself and I ask myself that question is this worth the next year year and a half of my life and if the question is yes if I'm that excited about it then I read it again and I ask myself another question if someone's walking by Hudson News in the airport they're pulling this off the shelf and they to read this same thing or something similar is that some is it does this idea get them excited enough to want to spend time that they're never going to get back in these pages so as I'm writing I thinking about that that's what I'm thinking about I'm thinking about the story it's all about the story it's not about what's selling it's not about short short chapters or longer chapters what's popular it's about none of those things it is all about the story because you're never gonna g to please everyone so if you honor the story and all your band with all your heart soul into every single word then you're respecting that reader or that listener today who is spending time with you that they're never going to get back so that's how I approach it I don't approach it uh from a business side which maybe I should like oh what's selling what's popular but no it all has to be about the story why not just uh be your own publisher at this point you know you have like a pretty nice direct audience you're uh you've been on Joe Rogan a bunch of times and those get millions of views you get millions of Impressions across all these other podcasts uh why not just do your own thing at this point well I like being where I am I like the team that they have at Simon and shusher I like the production value of audiobooks um I like Ray Porter who narrates who's absolutely amazing um I like that they have Regional Representatives all across the country you get these books into Target and Walmart and all I like that machine that's doing that because that allows me to focus solely on writing um and I don't have to worry about that other side of it so it's uh I can see why someone would want to First build up a social media presence or something or an audience and then have the book knowing that certain percentage of that audience will take the action that you want but that's not that wasn't my my way and that's not how I grew up and that's not how I wanted wanted to adapt to the new space I wanted to adapt to it in a different way where I still have a publisher and there's still an art department for the cover and there still all that so I have that machine working there and I can solely focus on writing and then also figure out the things that maybe a large Publishing Company isn't so great at so the social side of the house and the digital marketing side of the house and the podcasts and all of that so I think it's a very good partnership as far as the business goes for for for me everybody's going to have a different way we had this guy um on the Pod and we've had him a few times his name is Scott Galloway Scott Galloway is a successful entrepreneur but he also uh is a author and kind of a thought leader I don't know what you would would describe him as but he uh he's a wonderful speaker and his new Crusade right now is on young men and how young men are are kind of getting forgotten a bit uh you know if you look at like suicide rates depression rates if you look at uh education like young men are are getting are getting left behind a bit and I felt that and I remember I was going through a period in my late 20s where I had a little bit of success but I was like I still like I I I now have a young family and I was like I need I want to learn a little bit more about what it means to be a man and so I went through this um this like reading like I read all these like man books like teach me to become a man I guess and so I noticed that I would read your books and I felt like I was being inspired to be a more high integrity man and which James ree is what books have you read that sort of like got you on that path of being this sort of I don't know like teacher of young men because that's kind of like what you've become a little bit yeah and it's interesting now when I go up to uh book signings uh like said first book came out in 2018 so now somebody read that book when they were 15 16 17 18 now they're a few years into a uh their time in uniform in the military or law enforcement or whatever else so now I have people coming up to me and saying I was inspired to join the military I was inspired to get into law enforcement I was inspired to do this because of your books and I knew that was a possibility but I didn't really dwell on it but the last book tour uh or maybe on before was the first time where that really started happening but uh you know it happened naturally for me so I didn't like get to a certain age and say what book should I read in order to it was just I was constantly reading as a student of warfare um and and one book that stands out as my most gifted book it's called once an eagle by Anton Meyer it's written in 1968 and it's historical fiction and it follows two people from right before World War I up to Vietnam they don't call it Vietnam in the book they call it something else but that's what it is one of them's an officer and one of them gets a battlefield Commission on the battlefield in World War I and then you have the inter War years you have World War Two and it goes like I said up to Vietnam but the guy who is the uh he's a politician in uniform he's the he's the officer he's always just a little bit ahead of this guy Sam Damon who is uh who who's who's the he's like the leader of men that you would want to be as you read this book and so I would gift this book to people who are starting their career in the profession of arms and there's a reason it's called The Profession of arms not the career of arms and I would write a letter and I would put it in the front cover and that's one that they could read before they started reading it would kind of set the tone why I'm giving them this book and then I would say in that letter but there's another letter at the back and that is sealed and you have to work your way through this book and it's pretty thick so you can use it as a blunt impact weapon or as a door stop if you need to so it's dual use technology and at the end and then that's my take on what you just read and I don't want them to read it beforehand because I don't want to pollute their reading experience with my interpretation so it gives them incentive to get to the end to get to read that last letter and setting the tone with the first one so that's my most gifted book but it really is a is a book about leadership and uh and so that's why I would give it to these to these guys but through that context of historical fiction so it reads like a thriller but you're learning about history at the same time but it's really all about leadership well you have this I mean you had a career where you sort of you had a write a passage so you went to the military you experienced some crazy stuff and I imagine it's like I imagine there's some times where it's like I just grew up really fast and now I officially feel like a man um women a little bit have uh you know they have a physical thing where it's like you're now a woman men don't typically have that at least not now in some cultures they do where they're like you know I like to read about the Spartans and they're like all right now you go off in the wilderness and you do this thing you come back you're a man you know the Jewish culture has a Bart Mitzvah and bat mitzvah so there's a little bit of a you're a man now but we don't really have that in America for like most men and the reason why and I always felt that was lacking I'm like I I don't have this like I didn't I didn't there wasn't this like beginning middle and end of a journey where it's like I've come out and I'm now an adult and so I think that's why I like reading your stuff because it's like I'm living vicariously through the through through James Ree and I experience this like heartache and this like Evolution and it's like I now feel weirdly more manly I mean as as cringe as that sounds but it's like you know they say you're the average of The Five People You spend with most I think I'm the average of like the last years worth of reading I've done do you know what I'm saying so it's like I'm getting a little bit of a right a passage a little bit through like your work if that's if that makes sense well yes and that's why it's so important I think for kids especially like who they follow now in this world because those five people you're spending the most time with how it can be virtual it's not that person on the playground or as you get older someone you're in a that's a mentor type relationship or in an internship or or something like that um a lot of these people are the people that they're following so that's why it's so important for you follow um but yeah for most of human history there was exactly that there was a right of passage and it was there for a reason it was a reason the reason was that you could prove to the tribe to the community that you could add value because if you didn't then well your tribe's not going to last for very much longer so were these trials there were these teachings uh mentorships uh and then you'd have this trial that you would go through to prove that you were a valued member of the tribe and then that slowly started to go away but mostly in the The Well 19th 20th century there was still was still around before that but uh today it is almost entirely lacking which is why I think so many people feel lost because they have it's not institutionalized into our society but it's in our DNA because I think that there there's a reason that it was around from the beginning of time up until a time we got so comfortable where we didn't have to have it um and that was so that we could survive as a species so your tribe could survive um but that's why I think young men whether they know it or not are drawn towards typically in this country it's Marine boot camp like that's the one that most people think of but it's also you see these things where it's like Rich guys spending like 15 grand for a weekend and a little bit of it's like dude that's lame uh but on the other side I'm like I understand why you want that and uh you got to get it how you can get it I guess yeah they missed it when they should have done it or when another culture a thousand years ago would have had it as part of this process to bring people into the tribe but we don't have it so people find it later and they're like oh geeez I missed that part and then they start reading these books and they're like oh that's what I was missing that's why I felt this draw at a certain age that I didn't listen to like listen to that calling like the hero's journey you heed the call and uh so yeah Marine Boot Camp or it's Army Special Forces Q course Navy Seals it's called buds training but something that allows you to go through this trial and tribulation allows you to test yourself and then prove to the group that you're worthy of joining the ranks um and I think if you don't do that in one way shape or form it doesn't have to be military but if you don't do that then I think that's why people feel so lost these days General yeah look I get those things and maybe I'll do them just don't post any pictures of me online doing it because that would I would I would need another uh write a passage to get through the ridicule that I would receive for posting where obsessed I uh there's in the comfort crisis I'm obsessed with this idea they had um it was called misoi have you heard and we' talked about a bunch here on this P but have you heard of bji it's basically like this idea of uh it stems from this Japanese guy who this Japanese myth of like he goes to like I think he goes to like hell or something to find his wife who has been kidnapped and he goes to this massive Journey where he gets dirty and grimy and he's finally saves his wife he brings her back he washes himself off in this waterfall and he's now a new man because of the hardship that he went through and uh the Mis it was I think his name was misoji and so a lot of people now what they're doing is they're doing these like really hard things physical things so for example the guy who made it popular he'd be like today we're going to get our paddle board and we're going to paddle to this island that's 15 miles out and then we're going to paddle back and the there's basically two rules which is one you have to only have a 50% chance of succeeding and number two don't die and so I'm training for my misogi right now which is a 50 mile race but I got like obsessed with this idea of like a misoji of like having this like really hard concept um and I would like went to this whole like phase where I was reading you and and all about all this stuff have you ever heard of the the misoji you know I feel like I should have because I read the Comfort crisis but I read it uh a couple years ago now when it first came out had Michael Easter on the podcast um but yeah I don't feel that anymore because I feel like I did that already I'm like oh this looks exhausting I think I feel like I've done that most of my life so now it's really all about writing having each book better than the last that's always my goal which is why the last book I finished is always my favorite up to this point anyway I don't know if it'll always be that way but that's how it is thus far because I do feel like I'm improving with each with each book improving as as as an author um as a writer and that's what I owe owe the audience so so yeah but so I don't but I understand it I understand that draw to do something difficult uh to test yourself I certainly understand it you kind of have this even though you know you're I would stereotype you as like a tough guy um you have this like weird uh not weird but you have this I don't know how how to describe it almost spiritual way about you where I remember you told a story about how before or maybe when you were writing the first book you were like Chris Pratt is the guy I need to get him to do this and lo and behold after a handful of years he calls you and he was like hey your book's awesome I would love to turn this into a show and maybe I'll star in it whatever do you believe in the these weird type of like spiritual manifestation type of things of like if you want it bad enough it things come true because it seems like it's happened a few times in your life where it's kind of you've kind of called your shot when it seemed ridiculous at the time yeah I mean it seems like but it's more than just calling it or manifesting it you know sitting down and visualizing it it's more that's like so it's more that's when you think about someone thinking about how they're going to make that a serve in tennis or a extra kick Point soccer or what like that's very tactical and you can watch videos and you can manifest it and think of it the Strategic one and now obviously that tactical level requires work but the Strategic level one also requires work but it's not that one thing like that one foot placement or that one that way you're going to throw the ball whatever it might be um so I think that's but if there's a spiritual side to it which I think there there's a spiritual side to everything that connects us but uh it's more the work and it's not going to happen without putting in the work that's the thing might not happen if you put in the work that's that's possible too but it's certainly not going to happen if you don't so as I'm starting to write this thing as a child of the 80s it's very natural for me to think about who's gonna star in the F who's gonna star in the TV show and at the time I was like oh I saw Chris Pratt transform from this guy who played Andy dwire on parts and wreck funny overweight uh and then I saw this transformation in Zero Dark 32 a seal and uh so I said this is a guy who needs a role like this he needs it for his career and so I'm thinking this in December of 2014 and uh so I'm like Chris Pratt will play the main character he'll play James Reese he needs it for his career and then who do I want to direct antoan fuka I love Antoine fuka training day and chose the son and all these and he's the guy that's that's who I want to uh to direct this thing and then I just go about writing I have no connection to Hollywood no connection to publishing and you haven't even uh published the first one at this point no no I haven't published the first one no idea how I'm G to get it into a publisher but I'm not thinking about any of those things no social media presence uh no Facebook did you tell your friends that you wanted this to happen um no in the SEAL Teams you wanted to keep anything about writing close to the vest uh but like would you tell your wife or whatever like kill talk you're like hey would it be neat one day if Chris Pratt was Jay Reese yeah yeah no I told people uh like like my wife she's known I wanted to be a seal and RVE known each other since we're 18 years old so uh she's been on this journey for the entire time um but uh but how it manifested I guess is a way that I never would have expected is that I call going to call from a friend who I serve with in the seel teams who calls me in November of 2017 so about six seven months before the book even comes out and he calls me and says hey do you remember me because I had talked to him in about five years and he said uh I said yes of course I remember you he said you remember what you did for me in the SEAL Teams and I was like uh no and he said well you're the only person when I said I was getting out leaving the teams you're the only person that sat me down in your office talked about transitioning out of the military introduced me to people in the private sector followed up with me said asked if you could do anything else I've never forgotten it and I always wanted to thank you and I said no problem I was going and he said it's going great but I heard through the grave fin you have a book coming out and I said yeah it's coming out in a few months it's called the terminal list I can send you a copy if you want to check it out and he said I'd like that but I'd like to give it to a friend of mine also and I'm like yeah who's that he's like well it's my my best friend is Chris Pratt I was like oh well that's very convenient for me because I pictured him playing this role all these years ago and so he gave it to Chris Chris read it in December of 2017 and then he called me the first week in uh 2018 and want adoption it at the same time another friend unbeknownst to me had given a copy to antoan fuka theyve met at a speaking event and he gave a copy to antoan fuka antoan what read it he wanted to option it and Chris and Antoine knew each other from magnificent s so then they called and and worked it out now we have the terminal list on Amazon Prime how's that feel to be not a nobody but just a guy just a guy making these ridiculous predictions and they're they come true yeah well I mean it wouldn't have happened if obviously if I hadn't um I always really cared about people in the teams and my focus was always on on the guys and helping them whether they're staying in or getting out and I did notice that a lot of other people especially officers didn't do that if you said you were getting out they only cared about you if you were in the SEAL Teams and that just wasn't wasn't me um so if I hadn't helped Jared out and at the time I didn't think anything would ever come back around that wasn't the reason I did it obviously um but it did came came back around and now I'm flying out to Budapest in about a week to go film out there they're on set right now Jared's a writer and a producer and an actor a technical adviser on set right now Jared Shaw who gave uh Chris the book and uh and this is the second season and we have another one coming up here with the second book with with Chris in it that uh should start filming in 2025 you never know until it's actually all completed and ready and actually up there on the screens but so I try to manage those expectations but um yeah so now we're off to the races and then there these other Hollywood projects and multiple books and now the non-fiction and I have a have a strategic plan that uh that I've written out just by being a a student of all this uh my whole life but not with the intent of being a student more so just like I said from the fan perspective but I have a strategic plan with all these things that I want to build because essentially those goals that I that I wanted was serve my country needi form as a seal do the best job I could be the best leader be the best operator I possibly could then write a novel have it be number one New York Times best seller and get it up on the screen so those things are done and now it's just by doing all those things better and continuing to grow in a way that's real and authentic and adds value to people's lives and allows me to do what I love to do and then also allows me to hit my my my mission so my mission is taking care of my family my passion is writing I wanted to combine those things for purpose going forward as I left the seal because I saw so many people not know what they wanted to do or think that they knew and then all of a sudden step into it and realize this wasn't really what they wanted after all do you think you have you hit the you know I sold my company my first company when I was 31 and that's where I hit that's where I hit the financial where it was like on paper I never need to work again because my income from my uh stock portfolio can pay for a really great life forever of course I still want to work forever because I I enjoy it have you been able to cross that threshold to where financially you're like I can breathe because uh I you know as a working for the government you're you're not rolling in it but I imagine you are now like have you have you been able to like cross that threshold yeah not yet not yet but I'm I'm on the on the cusp but not uh not quite there yet and uh getting closer but a lot of this has been invested back in so I think a lot of of people probably would have held on and not done boxes when you can't afford it and put it all on your credit card early on like those boxes is that what you were doing those boxes were yeah everything so everything's going back in like how do I how do I get a podcast going how do I do a video for this book that looks like a movie that's better than any author has ever made before to promote a book uh okay how do I do that well I invest uh because it cost money to do that um so I invested a lot back in to grow you can't get the publisher to pay for that I think people think that the publish is for these things I would have thought that yeah and I think some other people now because now I see other authors doing something similar and I I've like I got I got something from meater the other day you talked about those and it came from the who from from me eater has a new has a new cookbook out and it came a couple days ago it's I'm gonna be on my Father's Day gear guy just to you know do my part and be a you know help him out a tiny bit um but it came from certainly came from the publisher uh so I think maybe other Publishers also think that my publisher pays for these things but it's really just me out of pocket as a business My Hope for you and this probably doesn't align with your want so I don't know if it's going to happen but what I want as a fan is I want to see Jack Carr become the new me eater I want to see like a lifestyle Media Company all around your stick and I know I I told you about churnin so churnin company uh churnin is a company that invest in me eater or things like it so you know brands that have a strong Affinity with different lifestyle Styles and then they eventually make more content and sell stuff and hope hopefully uh and they've done it a bunch they create really big businesses uh that are awesome for you as an owner because you make money but also awesome as me as a consumer because now I have more uh James re terminal list jackar stuff in my life that's my hope for you is that you uh that one day you take that path because I am being selfish but it would be cool for you as well maybe if it aligns with your values thank you yeah as long as there's a way to do it where it Still Remains authentic and and real to that uh that person who's trusting me with their time or their in money um then then yeah so I think it's it's things are going in that direction that's certainly a possibility last question which books that or resources that are a little bit less known that helped you that taught you most about the storytelling or creative process that I can go and read yeah so those those for sure the one on Stephen King on writing series of books by stepen ffield that all really talk about same thing but go into different nuances as far as uh overcoming resistance doing the work putting in the time becoming a professional so those uh one another one's called the successful novelist by David Morell who created Rambo with First Blood back in 1972 there's that one uh and then the heroes uh the hero's journey through hero with a thousand faces uh by Joseph Campbell and that one right there influenced Star Wars and once you read that book or watch a series of interviews that he did on PBS back in 1988 with Bill Moyers how the power of myth you realize how similar these stories are across cultures and why they resonated from the beginning of time because some of these stories these myths were really created to pass on lessons uh lessons of the hunt lessons of warfare so the Next Generation doesn't have to learn those same lessons in Blood and that tribe that Community can grow and not just survive hopefully but Thrive you're the man I um I appreciate you doing this you um your books have uh not only been fun but they've changed me a little bit as a kind of as a man as a husband as a father as a citizen of America uh you you've done amazing stuff and I uh I wish nothing but amazing success for you and your family so thank you for all this this is awesome oh man I appreciate that and then thank you for the podcast I'm so glad I discovered it uh because I'm gonna be taking taking notes going forward on how to to to scale things and how to do things a little better because no matter what I'm doing in life I always want to do it a little better the next time I always want to adapt and be more effective and efficient with what I'm doing so uh thank you for what you do as well I appreciate you and that's the pod [Music]

do you know that Logan Paul was starting to emerge very little on vine when Vayner media for Virgin Mobile did a campaign called finding the next Vine star he grew up in the linelight right you think about like what happened in Japan or all this stuff it's tough these kids you think about child stars when we grew up we all knew that like child stars would be [ __ ] up right and now everyone's going through that the Limelight is hard so I think Logan is well- intended he's very entrepreneurial I've always thought of him as a Marky Mark or a fresh PR for the rock meaning I always watched him from afar and as I got to know him a little bit I was like okay this kid is Logan Paul today just like Marky Mark was Marky Mark before he was Mark Wahlberg just like the Fresh Prince aella or Will Smith before he was Will Smith I've always thought that Logan would cross over and he has obviously with WWE in a lot of ways and I think that will continue if you told me Logan is like an action star the way John Cena was at the Academy Awards last night is Logan doing that in 15 years I'm like that makes sense to me that's how he's wired

improved 10 minutes I predicted that I was going to be uh a hair under 20 minutes I got like 20 minutes and like 15 seconds it was really hard it was really hard yeah it was very diff it was very difficult I like the challenge cuz no matter what level of Fitness you have it's just super hard for you at like if you're really fit going fast makes it harder if you're not fit just finishing it makes it hard and so shout out to everybody who did it if you did it you're the real winner in my heart I'm shocked how fast people were I thought so I I guessed my time correctly I said that was going to be the 90th percentile not even close people were going so fast could you have gone faster yeah I think uh so what we said in the rules was the only rules were you had to do it and you had to do nips to the ground meaning for your push-ups and your burpees you had to touch the ground but then besides that we said nothing else and the fastest people it appears as though they broke it up to 10 uh 10 like rep increments and that was probably the right move I did it in three uh 33 rep increments that was probably wrong yeah form is definitely it's the Hot Topic here it's the debatable thing uh nobody's form is perfect I don't even know what perfect form would have been so we're just going to do our best and see what happens all right let's watch some of these videos so this guy Ben Ferguson let see this guy had an Advantage he is a videographer so first of all he wore a weighted vest so already this guy's this this guy's trying to win the cool points he's not trying to win the speed prize but I respect that he's up in a mountain somewhere you know how much TR trouble I had just setting up the tripod this guy's got the Drone following him up a mountain oh wow look at this should just hire this guy it's also harder for the tall people yeah this guy looks like he's seven eight did he did he say his time uh let's see his time no he didn't he didn't even say oh see see this guy he knows what's up he didn't say his time instead hash beautifully done like we always say it's the challenge just beautifully done and I gotta admit this was beautifully done inspirational D he didn't motivational he didn't even do it oh no he did have the time 16 uh he said for the record my time was 16 minutes and 3 seconds hoping for 15 minutes but I'll take it so okay so he filmed this epic one and then he just went to his backyard and did it for time also separately all right that is H eight and a half out of 10 eight and a half what kind of what kind of Russian judge are you what's going to be a nine this guy filmed it with a drone on a mountain with a weighted vest it was the first one we watch I can't go too high all right let's do um okay this guy's amazing did you see this guy so Dustin came in strong with the S par costume we all right so there's context when I was 21 years old I had a hot dog stand and I these I'm holding a sign that says all beef dogs that was my sign I look extra fat in that photo there was wind blowing I think in my tank top like the wind dude I don't think I was that thick but yeah I look a little thick and he copied my sign exactly and he looks like he looks like me he found the blue he found the blue tank top got the all beef dogs I look like Bobby Hill this guy I mean the costume he's already an instant Contender for top top uh top costume here what do you think that was pretty good uh that was pretty good that was a deep cut I'm shocked he found that photo all right um you're gonna love this one this guy just a hero so this guy's 50 years old shredded shredded but also kind naturally shredded not like achievable shredded yeah not like oh that's strange what do you take like that's not my first question what are you taking I don't suspect that he's on trt also somebody tweeted out they go they go well this guy's doing it in front of the [ __ ] paron like what do you want me to do he's like in front of the Coliseum over here and he did a fast time 15 minutes very good I beat Sam he did he beat me by five minutes he crushed me dude all these CrossFit guys annihilated us do you think at 50 are you going to look like this guy at 50 I think I'm gonna look better well he beat your time now he's 15 years older than you but all right okay so let me just I would like to talk to you about CJ Guston okay CJ Guston let's take a look at this guy's profile picture seems like a average looking guy yeah he's an accountant I would bet if you said if you just showed me uh 10 people in a lineup with this guy's one of them would I have said yeah that guy's really fit yeah that guy could beat me in a race what it look like when he po that top dude look at this look at the Delta between his actual Fitness and body versus his profile picture yeah he looks good I mean this guy needs a new profile photo what's he let me see a I need a full we need I need full frontal is that what full frontal means he didn't give us a full frontal but the guy did the whole challenge in 10 minutes and 17 seconds which is insanely fast almost as fast as the winner I think and by the way this guy is like a he's like a finance guy startup CFO yeah I looked at his picture and I said he was an accountant I wasn't to we were in the ballpark you know what he should say instead of opinions are not my own not investment advice he should also say what my body looks like yeah face is not not indicative of body face not indicative of B CJ you are a sleeper man you you you have it going on all right let's look at some of the fast guys um so first of all this guy didn't win but he kind of won my heart a little bit so this guy he's got a thick neck just just a stud on a beach says he's in Brazil says he's in Brazil in his opening speech you know he's not like he's not like sucking up to us you know what I mean he knows is he American he's not like hey man big fan love the Pod you guys Inspire none of that he just says I'm out here on the beach in Brazil going to do the work going to do the challenge and then he hits us with the let's [ __ ] which is just the subtle nod that yeah I'm a big fan I listen to the Pod but I'm not going to I'm not going to lay it on thick here and then the guy in the sand explosive is word that comes to mind that is explosive what time did he get 11:40 in sand yeah that's a pretty good time and he looks like he's doing it perfect form uh all right so this guy's like a like a runnerup is 11 minutes 40 seconds in the sand extra difficulty uh this guy8 minutes and 15 seconds to do the challenge Alex bakera what do you think of this CrossFit Burpee thing they do where when they jump they look like a dead bug instead of like jumping their hands up they have and they kind of have duck feet I think that's the way to go that's like kind of how you gota like it's definitely like Optimal but h I don't know don't love that but insane time for this guy 8 minutes 15 seconds are you ready to see the winner Sam who can beat eight minutes and 15 seconds when I show you this guy I'm just gonna pause the video all right that's a man that's a man full head of hair on the chest he's got a chest beard that is a man just shredded drink it up comic s's font or something what up Shan and Sam in yellow all right I already I'm intrigued doing it in socks no shoes optimal doing it on a turf field no resistance not like the sand guy right this guy wanted to win he also looks like he was built for this challenge in that he's got very short arms incredibly short arms so this guy got eight minutes and what eight minutes and six seconds dude look at those look at those P he calls luckily I have short arms and I can do the burpees fast so he does the burpees he's drifting away off camera but he also puts his uh his story on here so he says just graduated from business school in Canada I run a student painting business I'm trying to break the franchise record the franchise record is 1 million so I'm literally trying to make my first million this year he just ties it in I listen to MFM in the car while I'm driving to sales and checking in on the cruise he had a cold tub and he broke it pulling on our heartstrings this guy had it all he had the time he had the story he tied in with the Pod and he's got the heartache of of his broken cold plunge also will Brun like a Usain Bolt style name I just love it all right so that's the fastest guy are you ready to see the fastest girl that was the fastest guy that the hairy guy number one he wins a cold plune oh you said he was number two so that guy's number one that guy's number one number two was uh that guy get the plunge that guy got the plunge Bran or what's his name bunan Bron will forever known as br will bran congratulations my friend time to get cold this guy Matthew price who's got like a water polo picture here so you know this guy's fit him and his girlfriend opposite sides of the world they did it like over Zoom or something like that that's awesome he got 9 minutes 52 seconds she got 10 minutes and two seconds so fast and he's got his uh he's got his video he's got her video they did it together so they were very close she was I think third place amongst women so congratulations did she do real push-ups yeah so what uh well yeah she did not on the knees push that's what you're asking so now Jenna Stark came in with technically the fastest time but we got a little controversy here on the form okay so she's a crossfitter and check out the form here so she's doing push-ups but she's hitting the ground with every pushup like she's but that's not against the rules that we said you said nips to the ground but that doesn't mean you like a push-up you don't let your body go at the bottom that is pretty funny just like just gonna [ __ ] fall and so she but I mean she's very fit and she did her burpees extremely well so eight minutes and 58 seconds which is insanely fast fast here's here's I think the the challenge what was the fastest guy for the time or the fastest uh guy's time 806 got it wow so she's 50 seconds slower than the fastest guy now she invites a friend over friend doesn't even have Twitter friend does The Challenge friend does 9 minutes and 44 seconds so definitely slower about a minute slower but look at this form perfect push-ups dude Jenna Stark just lost it for herself by submitting her friend yeah with friends like this who needs enemies yeah she just she blew it that's great form this is great form and so I kind of feel like it should be Jenna Stark's friend who wins she doesn't have Twitter how are we even going to contact she may not listen to the podcast she might just be a crossfitter that J of went told to do this challenge we've got to we're gonna send it to Jenna and Jenna's not gonna say like she's not gonna give it to her friend yeah okay so I think what we do we send it by the way they did it in the same gym I think so we're just going to put it in Jenna's gym and then from there they can share the tub they can split the tub they can fight over the tub they can CrossFit over the tub whatever whatever they need to do all right so that is the fastest female time so congratulations Jenna Stark and your friend you guys get to share the plunge those are the top male and female winners of the challenge that's amazing uh so to the Paul bunan guy and Jen Stark congratulations all right let's now try to find our honorary winners costumes creativity whatever else it is so well what what are

burpees hands up with the Hop and just crushes it could you believe this this is the real Paul Brun uh 10 minutes and 42 seconds super fast dude that's awesome he I wonder if he's got like a dip in and now technically he says he only did 98 burpees forgot two burpees but also honesty a a lost a lost trait in our generation this guy came in so honest didn't speed up the video just said here's every rep take it leave it sucker dude is he wearing work boots I'm surprised this guy has a yoga mat why is he doing this on a yoga mat why does he own a yoga mat coow hide or just brick I'm shocked he owns this all right pretty good what else I mean that's a contender okay next one I want to submit to you there's a guy okay so there's a girl who did it with a broken leg at first I thought it was a one-legged lady which would have been way cooler I this is who I saw I saw this lady she looks like she's got surgery or something on her ACL and she did it in one of these long casts where you got to keep your leg straight I mean to do this so she says I'm two months post surgery she's doing what are these called pistol squats she's doing one-legged pistol squats that's hard did she do a hundred of them did she do the whole thing that is so hard oh my God yes she did she did the whole thing she did the whole thing in 18 minutes she's going to have she beat your time with a broken leg doing one-legged pistol squads dude she's going to be uneven when she gets back walking with too L she' be walking in circles yeah jokes on you Abby I'd rather have two weak legs and one strong one I

well I give him props yeah he could have a some of my respect Barb let's who else who else we got okay there was a guy the guy deleted his tweet but I'm just going to say it out loud did you see the guy who every set put on a new article clothing and by the end was wearing like 50 t-shirts uh no why would he delete that I don't know I think because there was like a gap between when we submitted this and when we announced the winners or gave any sort of feedback and I think he kind of got embarrassed it's like when you're you you have your hand off for the high five and then you realize you're going to get left hanging and then you got to like pretend it was something else I think that's what he did he just deleted the Tweet but John Brown I loved that video I couldn't that just a hilarious creative way to do it put the guy was was wearing like 16 Cardigans doing burpees it was insane this kid 13 years old in Vietnam you can't hear this by the way he's playing Apple Bottom Jeans the song right here to start this off so the rotating dollar sign what a touch why does he have a skull at the bottom what does he have what is that a skeleton head a skull this is that's his
