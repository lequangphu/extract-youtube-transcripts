What do beer koozies and Facebook have in common? Not a whole lot, but when you offer free koozies on Facebook, people go cray. 

That's exactly what Chubbies Shorts did. Rather than dump a ton of money into Facebook advertising to hit their goal of 75k Facebook fans, Chubbies went for the organic approach. The result: they saved a lot of green and hit their goal of 75k fans. Check out how they did it in the video.

so our first can I say oh moment is that we were just getting our feet wet in the world of facebook marketing and and we have this genius plan where where we realized on facebook we could pay a certain amount to acquire a fan we found the price we could say then has its revelation that you know I can make a Styrofoam kuzey for half that price and shipping rates on just that kind of problems are much much less kind of added together than the price of acquiring one single fan base book instead of running ads on Facebook we would run an organic campaigns that was share our page and if our page hit 50,000 fans on Facebook we're going to send out koozies everyone who signed up and share our page so we did it we ran the campaign we ended up getting to 75,000 fans and we had to ship out 30,000 kooky what we thought great you know to ship them out and and we'll be done but the process of shipping 30,000 2 z's is no sympathy we packed accuse you an envelope took it to the post office and said please ship this to you know XYZ address with one single stamp on it they rejected that we have to pay five times the price we're assuming we're going to pay so we can start looking into the most advanced vacuum sealing technologies we started drown it duct tape down all the envelopes we started trying to use like slices you push them down and somehow gets into old nothing work then we hire contract workers just to come in and pack koozies and envelope for probably about three weeks straight that was our big associate moment it was in the in the states are kind of you know successful campaign that was a huge realization of wow 30,000 a humongous number and you really need to do more research on the way [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
this is the videos from the ambassador's we've decided that emails are pretty cool but videos take less time and you guys seem to like that last time I think the last video that I'd like eight comments on it most people were commenting on the fact that the video was vertical and horizontal but a copy Commodus yeah okay so today I'm posted last week I posted in the Ambassador group about Casey next step I'd never heard of them recently yes they called like mail time where they talk about packages that they got and we get a lot of packages I'll leave two or three a day some of you learned some that are gifts so but I want to talk about a gifts that we got yesterday I think so I got it because I company called eleven James so the back story is is that I wanted to buy a fancy watch because my parents have a Rolex that they bought when they're my age and they've had forever and so I thought it'd be cool to also buy back and so I found the service called eleven James eleven James comm where you pay between two hundred and a thousand dollars of them home life depending on how fancy but watch you want and they send you a watch online and I got my first one yesterday and we don't have to pay for it but normally it would be about Twitter box okay maybe 150 I don't know but we got this package so it came in kind of a weak box but I guess it makes sense because they're shipping like a $50,000 watch and you don't want like it to be paraded so it kind of it's a pretty lame looking package and then it came with a pair of socks which was pretty cool Aysen every we had already written about them in the past and then a card that said when we owe the watch back this one is owed back on eleven to interesting and then some more from asymmetric and here's the box it came in not the prettiest box no none at all and then inside the box was like like this what so here it is and it so there's your packaging kind of wack I think not that good and here's the watch unfortunately this is not their fault I gave them the wrong wrist size so this doesn't fit me wrong but it might fit Jackie so let's here I'll take you can try to be good you can put the watch on let's see what it looks like do you even know about it what so you have it on the runway so what's this what's this call let's watch can we tell okay don't list it on the box so so what do we think do you see well Jackie do you feel fancier fancy ah it's really heavy right yeah it is really heavy so there let's sit back and let's well all that people know we think that this watch is any good or not I am able to put it around my wrist without clasping it so I could feel the weight and in my opinion like this is so inconvenient it's it is probably our horses weighs maybe a whole pound it is pretty heavy maybe entire pound it's definitely hard so it's a bit I think that type of watch you would only know it's fancy if you're into that brand it's not like a you know everyone knows roll out so you see that name you don't make looking those fancy that brand I'm not a watch guy so I never even heard of it but a lot of watch people have heard of it but it's so heavy like you would never did it fit your wrist no it was a little tired snacks circulation - is both small resident what happened - a little bit typically works as big like you print out this like strip of paper and then you wrap the paper around your wrist and it's like a tape measurer and you know what size it is I actually when the woman reached out to me I just like pull marrows like seven inches was my wrist I thought that was right it because I I didn't measure it correctly so this is totally not their fault and they're sending me more links for it so it fits but even if they do some more lace this is so not convenient to type in and it looks pretty cool but I don't know if the coolness is worth it what do you think I mean you know the swag factor is pretty high on this though you know but it's not like gold it's over it's true it's it's older it's hard to miss it though on your wrist yeah functionality-wise it's gonna be doing you any favors so overall though I actually am pumped with the service I don't like this watch but I've seen celebrities wear it and I would have been tempted to if I want to spend money to buy it so I'm pumped that I got to try it out so I think the service is awesome and interestingly the best thing with the service is the business model which I don't know that you said they set up you said otherwise but George John was saying was that he thinks that the this company gives the watches 2:11 James and a love it James sends it out in profits from that and they don't actually have to pay for the watch because they're doing like PR that's interesting and so now like if someone is signed up to the service and they get like three or four different watches that they normally would never have bought maybe they'll try it on they'll really like it and they'll be able to go buy it or they'll tell the people about it so yeah we also saw that they had a program where if you have a really expensive watch you're willing to rent it out to other people if you do that they're willing to discount give you a discount on the watches that you rent properly yeah interesting so if you have several watches you could probably just rent a bunch of they're watching this for free illegal it understeers that's interesting that's me sweetie but overall happy with the service not happy with this watch still not convinced that having a fancy watch is worth it other than in my case in many people's case be like owning something that like that's an integer that your family owned you know a sentimental value that that definitely be worth it but there's a practicality as it that I can I do that I don't I don't see it but I still might buy I wonder we'll see you made free baller baller but I don't know if it's worth it yeah yeah okay okay we'll keep we'll keep this one short when we have five minutes 705 705 okay we'll keep this short let us know in the comments what you think of these types of videos maybe we'll keep doing on them we'll show you more stuff but this is what we were doing today we're reviewing eleven James and the service that we get sent to us thanks ambassadors peace

thank you Sam hey guys I'm Rita and it's great to be here at hustle con now I just have a few minutes up here so I thought I'd share with you guys just one lesson that zenitz has learned about hustle which is the importance of clearly defining your target market let's see if we can get the clicker to work there we go oh can I get oh there we go perfect all right so before I jump in uh really quickly for those of you who who don't know a lot about what zenefit does we solved this problem that I think pretty much every business owner in the US has which is that you have 20 different systems related to HR you have health insurance you have payroll you have time and attendance and because all of those systems are disconnected every time you need to hire or terminate somebody you have to add or remove them from 20 different places right every time somebody changes their address you have to update that in 20 different places so what and and that creates this huge administrative load that the HR Departments of most companies have to deal with so what zenitz does is we take all those different systems we connect them and we give companies and their employees a single place to do everything which makes which take takes a lot of work and a lot of time off their plates now because this problem that I described of all of these different disconnected systems is a problem that just about every company in the US has what we found at zenefits was that customers of all different shapes and sizes were knocking on our door we found ourselves serving everybody from a seveners tech startup to a 1,000 person Healthcare consulting firm and everything in between even though they all have slightly different needs and you know it's really tempting when youve rais a lot of money and you have a really big Vision to think that you can do everything all at once but the reality is that no matter how many resources you have and how big you are companies execute better when they ruthlessly prioritize and then sequence their efforts so we asked ourselves is there a you know should we better Define our target market is there a specific Market that we should focus on first before we expand from there and if so how should we Define that should be based on geography based on customer size based on customer vertical based on something different and I know this is a question that some of you guys might be thinking about now or some of you guys might need to think about in the future so I'll share with you how we approached it we took a look at our customer base and we thought a lot about product Market fit and we looked at a bunch of internal data and it became pretty clear that for us it made sense to Define our target market based on customer size and more specifically that we should focus on the small business Market there we go we should focus on the small business Market are companies with under 100 employees for a few different reasons one is that it's a huge market so there are over six million small businesses in the United States but it's also a market which is really underserved by technology so typically our main competitor is an Excel spreadsheet um in addition the free aspect of our product was particularly compelling for small companies we felt that we could have the most impact with small businesses because they typically don't even have one HR person to manage this big administrative burden and then from a product perspective the needs of this segment are the least complex to serve and to build a robust future set for so whether we looked at all of those factors or we looked at our internal data like sales cycles and close rates and retention rates it was pretty clear that for us we would outperform in the small business Market and so that was a target market that we should hyperfocus on first now the broader lesson here that I hope is helpful for some of you guys who are here today is that if you find that you're growing but you're growing in multiple directions all at the same time consider instead trying to proactively Define and then dominate a small but extensible Market before you expand further and now this has been a proven strategy for growth right if we look at Facebook choosing to focus on just college campuses or the different decisions that other companies like Amazon or Netflix or Uber have made they all chose to start out with just one vertical or One customer or one geography before they expanded from there sort of sequencing their Journey so they could build strength along the way that's my advice for you I hope this has been helpful and I wish you all the very best of luck thank you very much

Goodreads is the largest website on earth for all things books. 

With over 45 million registered readers who review millions of books, Goodreads grew at an astonishing clip, thanks to its members' passion for the product and word-of-mouth marketing. 

Otis Chandler, founder of Goodreads, ultimately sold the site to Goodreads, but has maintained its mission and continued to grow the audience. 

In his talk at Hustle Con 2016, Otis explains how he identified a problem, used that knowledge to build a product, iterated on the product by listening to his users, and grew his user base to 50 million people.

I hate being the speaker in between a crowd and it's alcohol so I tell you what we're gonna do I'm gonna make this fun I'm gonna make this short and then we're gonna go ate some drinks sound good all right so today I'd like to tell you the story of Goodreads my wife and I started it as co-founders 10 years ago I do the product and engineering she does the editorial and PR and all kinds of stuff and I'm just gonna walk through you know some of the strategies of how we did this and some of my beliefs on how you grow and scale a company so if you're not familiar with Goodreads we have 50 million registered members on the site about 400 million monthly page views which according to Qantas makes us a top 60 Us website that means we have more traffic than apple com Walmart com in Major League Baseball comm and our audience is interestingly 70% female so that roughly mirrors actually who buys and reads books and I think of the larger social sites only Pinterest probably has more female slant than we do all right so I'm gonna tell you guys my number one secret of success and it was supposed to come in with an animation but there it is I so whenever anybody asked me you know how did you do this what was the number one thing that led to your success my answer is always solve a problem and I'm in a lot of product reviews that at Goodreads I'm in a lot I get pitched a lot of business plans and the first question I always ask anybody on creating something new is what problem are you solving and for whom and if they don't have a super super crisp answer it's a it's a big red flag and sometimes you even run into people who don't even have a problem they just have a solution and they're looking for a problem you know variants of that are technological I have this awesome AI technology or machine learning technology or image recognition technology and I'm trying to figure out how to make a business out of it or I'm an awesome sales dude from Xyz big company and I'm trying to figure out how to make a lot of page views for some company so I could because I know how to monetize the out of page views so in my opinion and in my experience that that never works what works is when you kind of start backwards from just obsessing over what how can I solve a problem for someone and the great thing about solving a problem is if you do solve a problem you can make that the mission of your company so good reads our mission is help people find books very simply and share what they thought of those books and that's really at the core of what they do and this does at least two really good things for you number one it really helps you build a real good culture for a company you know recruiting here in San Francisco berry is very difficult but we actually do decently well we have 120 employees right across the bay in downtown San Francisco because anyone who's attracted this kind of problem and helping us solve this mission finds us the second thing it does that's really powerful is it helps you focus and I think all great you know most big successful companies you find this phrase mission driven I'm even starting to see that phrase bubble up in a lot of VC meetings where VCS are talking about finding mission driven founders but the thing that's powerful it does is it helps you focus but almost more importantly it helps you focus you know as you get one of these things that starts to grow you suddenly have a hundred different opportunities in front of you and saying no to all but a few of them is actually really really difficult so I love this quote from Warren Buffett the difference between successful people and really successful people is really successful people say no to almost everything it's very hard to do so Goodreads we were acquired by Amazon three years ago it's a big exciting moment for me and as part of that process I met Jeff Bezos and the very first thing he said to me first literally first words out of his mouth where we like mission driven people and I was kind like what you know I kind of expected like hey Otis nice to meet you or something like that but he said we like mission driven people you started Goodreads you must be mission driven and I thought that was pretty powerful in fact the Amazons collected a whole cadre of mission-driven companies but the biggest thing I think I've learned from Jeff is actually that he is the same secret idea when he when you ask him what is the top thing you've done right to grow Amazon and by the way I consider Jeff Bezos probably the number-one CEO or one of the top anyways in the world right now he has the same answer you obsess over solving customers problems and you know I've heard him say that directly you can google that he's been quoted as saying saying that in the press and I love this quote from him if your customer focused you're always waking up wondering how can we make that customer say wow we don't just want to solve their problem we want to do it in a way where they say wow I thought that was pretty powerful all right so let me tell you the story of how Goodreads came to be so it was 2005 and I walked into a friend's apartment in San Francisco and if you're if you're a reader at all like me and well a you know you probably have one of these bookshelves in your house one of these bookshelves where you've carefully curated all your favorite books that you've ever read and B if you walk into someone else's house and you see that bookshelf on display you kind of go right for it and it's fascinating right it tells you a lot about that person and in this case I was able to just literally sit there and grill my friend dude what did you think about infinite chest what did you think about diamond age what did you think about the girl played fire or dune or freakanomics and I walked away with ten books that I was excited to read and I thought wow that's pretty powerful that's actually that information is actually gold and my day job at the time I was a product manager an engineer at a company called tickle tickle was an early social network and dating site we actually used to compete with Sammy again so that was fun to see him talk so I said wow what if we could take all this awesome social networking stuff that I've learned how to do in my in my job and apply it to books and we make a social network where everybody would put on their profile that bookshelf that I know is in their house and not only that but put what they thought of those books if they did that I could just browse this browse the site instead of having to bar down their living room doors and grilled them about the books and I would never lack for a good book recommendation again and you know I think it's I think it's worked and so I kind of had an inkling when we did this that other people would have this problem and would find this valuable and one of the first places we actually got a lot of traction where it turned out a lot of people did have that problem was in the early blogosphere so this was the blogosphere of 2007 there was live journal and bloggers and what we found was there was this whole community of 70% women who were blogging their book reviews and they had ten friends on their blog role member blog roles who were doing the same thing and when they found Goodreads they adopted us in droves because basically we did what they wanted but better we helped them connect you share their thoughts about books and connect to like-minded readers another good thing we did early on and and this is super important when you're just starting their companies you got to nail the product market fit for your power users so the first thing we did one of the first features we launched was groups and the very first group I created was Goodreads feedback and this is a group we just talked to our users about what's going on with the product and we still use it today it's got almost twenty thousand people in the group and I don't know if you could see this on the slide but I have personally made for over four thousand comments in this group and I haven't commented much in the last few years my team mostly does it now so most of this was in the early days and I would literally spend an hour or two a day in this group and my favorite moment was when I could just respond back to someone who mentioned a problem or a bug or some some thing that they they couldn't do and say I fixed it or here it is but the key thing about this is if you nail the product market fit for your power users those are the people are going to say this product is awesome and spread the word they become your influencers your mavens and by the way they're the people who create all the content at least for us you know we're a long tail content sites so there are the people writing all the reviews creating all the discussion so once we kind of nailed that first flywheel that's what let us start to grow to the people who just wanted to consume the content fine all right so I have a theory about product development that I've developed over the years which i think is pretty powerful that I'd like to share with you guys and my theory is when there's a problem that a lot of people have you will find small numbers of people going out of their way to solve that problem using kind of manual or hack together tools and in the trick of course is can you productize what they're trying to do make it easy for them to do with technology to really amplify and then you can grow really fast and I already showed you one example of that with the blogosphere right those people were hacking together blogger and WordPress 2 to solve a problem and then we made a better product and they adopted us but I find this to be a really powerful lens for the world and now every time I'm evaluating a new idea I try to think where can I see people going out of their way to manually do this now we see it all the time on our own product usually in our message boards where people are using our message boards to try to hack them together to solve some problem and you can pretty much point to every major company and see that they did the same thing so before Craigslist was around you know people the way to buy and sell goods in a neighborhood was literally through a community bulletin board or maybe a garage sale that you advertised around the neighborhood it was very inefficient and only a few people did that and then Craigslist came around and a lot more people did that so a couple I'll give you two examples of where we did that with Goodreads number one is if you're an avid reader there are amazing avid readers on Goodreads I read a book or two a month I don't know about you guys I consider that pretty good but there are people who read a book a week there are people who read a book a day and if you're one of these people you know you actually have trouble remembering what you've read so we found that there were a lot of in our early research there are a lot of people who are literally creating spreadsheets on their computers of all the books they'd read and when they'd read them and what they thought and then in corollary to that is the to read list you actually still find this today that it happens all the time you're out at a conference you're having lunch with a friend they say dude you got to read this book it's amazing maybe you hear it on MP and most of us just kind of hope we remember that later but small numbers of people will actually go and pull out a little notepad that they keep in their purse or piece of paper in their wallet and write it down I would be willing to bet one of you in this room actually has such a thing on you right now anyone that's a lot more than I actually thought so we productized both of these these are screenshots of our mobile app but our desktop app is great at this too we make it super easy for you to catalog all the books you've read on Goodreads you can slice and dice and sort it all kinds of different ways and have great metadata and then your you can keep your to me list which is really the you know kind of best feature about our mobile app is now you can easily pull it out and record that book recommendation where when you walk into the book store library you can pull it out and there's all the books you wanted to read so these have becomes two of the big core use cases of Goodreads today all right another thing I believe in business and this is a truism is if you see something working working double down on it and if you're doing if you're building consumer based internet product anyway there's two ways to do that number one you can make your product better keep listening to your users keep making your product better and you've got to have that strong base and the second thing you can do is you can kind of tune your growth channels and for us we've always kind of focused 80% on making a great product 20% on tuning our growth channels that's obviously you know an average but so I'll walk you through some of the ways we tuned our growth channels so first if you solve a problem Google will reward you so back in the early days of Goodreads I I was very naive and I hooked up Google Analytics for the first time and I was like well that's weird Google says it's giving me half my traffic from search from SEO and I kind of didn't believe it I was like it must be wrong it must be buggy somehow huh and then later I met a guy who had a who had an SEO company a company that ranked well with Google Sites any kind of like oh yeah you got an SEO site you should you should go learn about that so then I did and we got quite good at learning how to traffic to a long tail content site for SEO and you know so but my main point to you is we didn't go around thinking oh we'll get a lot of traffic from SEO like it happened quite by accident and then once we learned it we did it we kind of learned how to tune the levers and the main inputs for for tuning SEO or really you know work on your inbound links so give people easy tools to share your product because then they'll do that and that'll put links out there in the wild and the second ways have lots of great content and that was the main thing for us so we focused on how can we have as many reviews as we can across as many books as we can very simple second we built some widgets for blogs so when back when we were going viral in that early blogosphere we built some widgets for those guys to kind of just share show off the books that they had been reading on the side of their blogs and we still have these today they're still effective and that that helped us go you know viral even faster amongst the blogosphere and the other smart thing we did was you know if you do if you build one of these it's basically just a line of JavaScript or flash it doesn't help you with SEO at all so we added in like a little logo at the bottom that was just static HTML to get a link right to our homepage so everybody who copied this link this widget to their blog gave us some SEO juice to our home page address book importers back in 2007 210 these things man these were the secret sauce they really worked before you guys get excited they don't they don't really work anymore but back then they were very they helped you go very viral and you know if you kind of Google around hacker blogs you can find this kind of stuff but back then this was really innovative stuff and the reason they were so powerful was you could design these really tight viral loops and what I mean by that was if you if you could get within 24 hours one user to invite one other friend that's all we needed to have happen then you have a viral factor of one dot oh and if you get just a hair above 1.0 you know one becomes two becomes three becomes four and it quickly rose astronomically and thirty to sixty days later your traffic does this so these things were were very innovative and required a lot of tuning you basically had to have a growth team just fully focused on this stuff and focused on conversion rate through every piece of the flow and half of it was copy you know what do you guys think would do better as a viral subject line let's compare books A or B join my reading Network a raise your hand in for a raise your hand for B I think you guys are wrong it was B join my reading network 3x better than a so like that kind of stuff you would have never guessed unless you test so once address book and porters stopped working so well we found another viral channel which was the Facebook Open Graph you might remember this it launched in 2011 and Spotify was the poster child everything you listened to was streamed on to your Facebook profile but there were 30 launch partners for the Open Graph and we were one of them here you can see a cool picture I snapped Zuckerberg talking us at the f8 the year after that is a good good example of it of a site using Open Graph but these viral loops were very similar but different so they were the same process within 24 hours you want one user to turn into two but here we're using you know Facebook sharing you're sharing what I'm reading share my review share the book I just started as the way to drive the the inbound links and again you need a good dedicated growth team to really rock this stuff and understand it so you know to 2007 to 2012 for us were a lot about this 80% make the product better 20% tuned our growth channels you know we did a lot of great stuff on the product we launched a recommendation engine which was very powerful and book clubs and lists and our mobile apps and what this did was gave us a strong bat now which is a really geeky way for saying we had a lot of options you know we were running the company breakeven to slightly profitable we raised a Series A that we didn't spend any of and this gave us a lot of options when you have this kind of growth to kind of say we could raise more money we could not raise more money we could also you know this also kind of attracted the attention of acquirers so that's as I said earlier what happened to us so March 28th 2013 we announced that we were being acquired by Amazon got on the top with Technium which I was proud of and you know I'll tell you quickly how that came to be but given that that's theme of my talk is solve a problem it's it's probably no surprise that that came to be because we were focused on solving a problem and the problem we wanted to solve was the basic flywheel of goodreads we wanted all users who read books to use Goodreads and find value in it and we weren't quite getting that we weren't getting everyone to remember when they put a book down to open up their Goodreads app and come say what they thought of it so we needed to make it easier for people to do that to share that and then of course at the same time you had Amazon well first they took ecommerce digital buying physical books online and then they launched the Kindle in 2007 which created this digital reading revolution which is the same year we launched ironically and you know today in this public survey I found 40% of books are bought online but in trade trade books I think it's much higher than that so this created an opportunity for Kindle to say hey we could actually build social stuff into our reading device and we were saying hey we have all this great social community stuff we'd like to bring into the eating experience so when we got together with the Kindle folks it was like a glove it was like they had the same idea we did we wanted to do the same stuff and we were both very excited for that so it just made it not easy to say yes but made it exciting so I'll share with you my two secrets of acquisitions again I could I was supposed to unveil those but number one people price people strategy in so these are the three ingredients you've got to have to make an acquisition work and I've been on both sides of acquisitions now and I've seen some others up close so people you've got to be super super excited with the people you're gonna work with in our case I think Amazon and the folks at Kindle are super super smart and passionate and innovative and I like what they're up to and the strategy is God had said gotta do like I said fit like a glove like you've got to be excited about the same stuff they're excited about and that's really key and then of course you have to come to a price that you both agree on and if you have if you're missing any one of those three things that's where acquisitions go straight and number two companies are bought not sold in a hundred percent of the times I've witnessed this is true it always starts with the acquiring company go going hey we have we have some problem we want to solve we want some place we want to invest in should we build it or should we buy it and then they run a search and see how cheap they can buy something so my message to you is if you're thinking about selling your company don't go around trying to sell it because that's not how it happens instead go around trying to solve a problem and if you happen to find a big company who's trying to solve the same problem and you like the people and you can agree on a price that's where it might happen so it's pretty exciting let me say that we're now a couple years into that big vision that we joined Amazon to build we've now got good reasons integration and an app on the e-ink reading devices and on the Kindle Fire tablets but we're really only about 1% just scratching the surface into the big vision for where what I think you know the future of reading the future of digital reading can go and it's pretty exciting to be not only a part of that but helping innovate on it so in conclusion my 10 is for building a company you know as I said in the beginning you got to start with solving a problem a hundred percent of the successful companies I've seen and you saw a bunch of them today where the founders said we were just passionate about solving some problem we weren't trying to make a bail billion-dollar company or anything like that and then you've got to listen to your customers and keep solving their problems you know we had the feedback group I used to spend an hour a day doing customer service emails we still have a program where all our people do customer service for a day once a year super super powerful to listen to your users and then number two if you're really soon solving a problem look for how people are going out of their way to solve that and see if you can productize it pretty much every feature we've built on goodreads UI I could point to an example where that has been true and number three be mission driven keeps you focused keeps you makes it easy to say no to stuff and and helps you track the right people and build the right culture so that's what I got thank you very much and for a couple questions hi Otis my name is Martine I'm a big Goodreads fan from Argentina and I wanted to ask you if you think it would make sense to apply the Goodreads model for discovering content in this case books for a different medium like podcasts what would you do similarly what would you do differently I would love to get your take on it thank you a good question I think we get asked about once a week if someone can build Goodreads forum movies or some other similar sounding genre so there's definitely an idea there yeah I think a lot of what we don't we have done can be applied to other genres you know we kind of do an interesting mixture of the bit the best way to find books is through your friends so we're a social network but it actually turns out your friends kind of suck at helping you recommend books like usually you're interested in other other kinds of books than what your close friends tend to be reading so the best way to then do it is find like-minded readers so you know just building the community where people can find like-minded people to them and see what they're reading that really works and then number three we leverage the the kind of the big data we leverage the wisdom of the crowds and that we've built like a world-class recommendation engine with a bunch of machine learning stuff to do that but it's essentially just looking and you know like recommendations by books tends to work really well behaviorally so if you're really into World War two books and you've read five we could look through our database and say who are the other people who read those same five tagged as World War two what else have they read find three others and you'll probably like those so that that kind of pattern matching and behavioral data tends to work really well so I think all those all three of those things friends community and kind of looking for patterns amongst those first two things with with machine learning can be applied to a lot of genres I hope that answered the question at us thank you for speaking with us today I'm a my name's Matt and I'm a voracious reader I once won a read-a-thon when I got to the Oakland A's Ben Wow I'm still read you know every everyday I've got my Kindle in my my bag but I lurk on your site and I do it because books are really personal to me and I just I haven't quite felt the trust with social networks that I want to expose what I'm reading even though I will happily talk to anyone about a book so at a time when I'm sure lots of people are dealing with sort of longtail business models where they have lots of lurkers but also there's increasing issues with like data privacy and potentially especially outside of this country but who knows with authoritarian governments and you know banning books subpoenaing librarians how do you treat user privacy and in this context and also maybe you could give some tips for people who have problems with lurkers just viewing their site but not contributing content Thanks sure so first I'd say lurking is a feature not a bug it's actually part of our business model like I said 90% of our content is written by 10% of our people and that's that's by design so most people can just use Goodreads to read reviews read discussions find lists that have been created by other people and they don't we don't need them to be trivia we've got a lot of content already and that's fine for those who do want to contribute content but maybe only see have a limited number of people see it we do offer the ability to make a private profile where then only your friends could see your profile and only your friends could see your friends but we don't have the ability for you to make have private book reviews so if you write a book review it would go on the book page like all others but if anyone clicked on your profile it would say private profile it is a feature request on our backlog to address that but in the world of all the exciting things we have to do we're not there yet so thank you sorry with governments I mean have you had any conflicts where people have wanted to see everyone who's I don't know downloaded the Communist Manifesto or anything like that you would think so but no I have never gotten that that request or had any issue that we have been blocked in China for most of our existence so I honest my name is Talia and I think that one of the beauties of book clubs and walking into someone's apartment and looking at their bookshelves is how personal it is and the sense of community that it offers so I was wondering if you could tell me how you've been able to effectively foster that same sense of community on a digital platform you know I think the powerful thing about the Internet in general is if there's ten other people in the world who are into some really weird and arcane thing that you're into you can find them and that's kind of what we found to be true at Goodreads if there's ten other people that are into reading nineteen sixties ballet books like my wife is she found those people on Goodreads and found some other cool ballet books through them and so I think that's a lot of what you see the community doing on Goodreads it's just kind of finding these like-minded readers and sometimes it's in really rare and niche areas and other times it's in really big areas so you know one of my favorite book clubs on Goodreads is called sword and laser run by Veronica Belmont and it's got 20,000 people in it and they read a sci-fi book and a fantasy book every month and then people come on and discuss it and it feels it feels kind of fun to be part of a community right now they're reading Aurora by Kim Stanley Robinson I recommend everyone check it out all right that's it thank you so much thank you guys all right we did

Casper is a web-first mattress company that is re-defining the way people buy mattresses. Based in NYC, with showrooms accross the country, Casper brought in over $1 million in revenue in its first 28 days. Since then, they've earned over $100 million in revenue, raised almost $70 million from investors, and amassed 40,000 Instagram followers. But the most impressive thing about Casper is how they've built a world-class supply chain. In this presentation, Casper's Chief of Product Jeff Chapin lists the 8 things he wishes he knew when he first launched Casper. Since Casper oversold on their first day, the company was unable to deliver the product from day one. It took months for their supply to catch up to their orders. Jeff Chapin recommends tactical steps to build a fantastic supply chain from the ground up.

raise the hands how many people have heard of Casper hey it's pretty good so for the ones that haven't I'll give a little explanation for those that have this is probably how you know us as a fairly well marketed company focused on sleep we sell one single mattress we sell one pillow we sell one set of sheets I'm one of the cofounders there were five of us background in product design and development so I'll get into in a sec I spent a lot of my time in places much more like this than in the fancier world of marketing so this is a factory where we manufacture the covers so it's a cut and sew facility in South Carolina I've spent a lot of time here and in other factories and today I want to talk about eight things that I wish I knew about building a supply chain so you'll see in a sec that my background is not in supply chain or operations I don't know how many folks in the audience think they'll start a company or have started a company that involves any physical object but building a solid operations platform is critically important so quick background I actually studied civil engineering at Princeton as an undergrad but I'm old enough that I didn't have a digital camera so I don't have photos from that time so I am technical but I don't know how to program so I'm maybe a halfway fit for this for this presentation I went on a study product design which is a mixture of art mechanical engineering at Stanford from there I moved to I do for a decade did a lot of work in consumer products a lot of work in medical devices I left I do I started my own company called common maid I spent a couple years working in East Africa in Southeast Asia in clean water and sanitation working with World Bank and Gates Foundation oddly enough through that world came across a cup sorry this thing is finicky called water wallah which was doing clean water access in a slum in Mumbai it was started by the guy in the back left Neel Parikh who's one of the cofounders of Casper he'll be featured bless him later on in the presentation these other guys were all friends in New York I only knew Neil and four folks that were in the New York who are familiar with the New York startup scene a lot more of the consumer focus single vertical branded companies Warby Parker's bonobos come out of New York not out of San Francisco and just some out of LA so they're working together doing different startups and alright and notice a couple things one amongst their peers and the people in the incubator they were working within that people weren't sleeping very much statistics are kind of sad in 1942 we were amidst the world war and people slept more than they do now when in the grand scheme of civilization things are really peaceful there's also this kind of stuff where people just I mean the fact that you have your child laying in bed reading an iPad is not good for their sleep it's not good for our sleep when we do the same thing and so that's the general thing which Casper was started to address we needed to start somewhere by selling a product to get into the sleep space and we started with the foundational product and from a consumer experience purchasing a mattress is one of the worst things you could imagine in terms of via the what you get for the dollar the actual shopping experience just way too much choice your ill-informed to actually know what you should be buying and if you're getting getting a good product for your money so we we boiled it all down through a process of product development iteration testing many different types of mattresses on the market developing our own and had the idea that we would sell a single product to the market we needed to we need to convince somebody to fund us to start this company because it's a very expensive and you'll see it caused us some problems when you want to build inventory when you're starting a company it's hundreds of thousands of dollars to millions of dollars just to build initial inventory so as we were doing our fundraising round we actually gave away a lot of beds to venture capitalists to try to get them to give us money and they nobody would give us money until they could sleep on our product so in the picture here we eventually led our been layer and layer hippo layer Venture Partners let our seed round and the right picture here is the mattress that been layer had in his apartment in the left is our Philip our CEO of Luke or CMO delivering our mattress to his house so we had to go in when he wasn't there with his personal assistant put in the new mattress take out his old mattress and actually store the old mattress until he was convinced that he wanted to keep the new one and he still sleeps on that prototype to this day which is amazing and I'm pretty sure it was he has a child now and it was the first child ever conceived on a Casper so this is the product we sell my talks are not meant to be about product design so I won't talk much about it but just so you get a sense for those who have an experience that aren't familiar with it that mattress gets compressed and rolled up and goes in a box it's about 20 inches by 20 inches by 40 inches it's delivered via UPS in some cities it's delivered via courier this is a bike courier in New York delivering it you get it to your house you unpack it and then you instantly turn into a stud that's that's our sales message so just to recap we started in April we launched the public in April 2014 and it was amazingly successful from day one we did a million dollars in revenue in our first month we've raised 70 million dollars through a series B in 2015 we did over a hundred million dollars in revenue right about 150 people we have our headquarters in New York we have a design and supply chain office here in San Francisco we have office in LA in office in Berlin why were we successful two things I think one three things one I think the products great but I'm biased I'm the one that designed it we've had really creative marketing out folks may have seen some of this marketing on the on the bar this one's my favorite it was sleep like a narcissist because you're dreaming of yourself dreaming of yourself and then this which just blows my mind there's an incredible amount of social sharing of the Casper mattress and the unboxing experience online there's actually a video associated with this which I won't show but we had a problem we grew so fast that we couldn't meet our sales demands and everyone says it's a good problem to have but it's incredibly stressful problem so to put numbers to it we sold 139 beds on our first day we had a hundred beds in stock beds have a four to eight week lead time to get made we reached 35 days of backlog by October so if you bought we promised in our marketing message that you would get a mattress the next day or the day after some people had to wait five six weeks to get a mattress we actually stayed in backlog for 18 months and we've only been around for 25 months and still the day on some individual products we run in the back this is a huge problem it actually slowed our growth we had to pull back on our spend in order to allow our supply chain to grow so I think we nailed product we nailed marketing we nailed brand we nailed the value proposition but we totally missed on supply chain and it goes back to what our original team was there was five co-founders is a large co-founding team our first employees were in marketing and consumer support we did not hire an Operations person for a year so we went a year with just me and Neil running our supply chain and we didn't know what we were doing so for those that have an ops or supply chain background hopefully this will be obvious but I'm just going to run through eight stories and eight quick learnings and some things that if I were to do it again I would hopefully do better and some are low-level points some are high-level points first one first story when we went to what ended up being our main mattress supplier in Georgia Neil and I flew down there we stayed we shared a room and it days in that was $30 a night we went to rent a car online we could have rented a Chevy Aveo for $40 or through sixth which is a German rental car company we could have rented a BMW for $40 clearly we rented the BMW but then we pulled up into the factory driving a really nice BMW which is a terrible thing to do when you're about to go into a negotiation about what you want to pay for a product on the same trip to the southeast we showed up at the sewing factory which I showed before and Neil's wearing that shirt amongst people that are working their butts off to get $12 an hour sewing they thought it was funny but it was not a great first impression so my advice he deliberate in how you dress how you arrived and what you talked about we all have very great indulgent luxurious lives the people you work with on a supply chain probably don't get $15 martinis they probably don't talk about going bowling and ping-pong indoors and indoor mini-golf so when you're out of supply chain sight or you have people in your supply chain visiting you remember that we live a very different life than most of these people that would be supplying products to us something's more serious everyone will say they can do everything but it's not true this is the this is the factory where we pulled in with a BMW they make from our opinion based on having visited tons and tons of foam factories in the US and overseas probably the best quality raw material that we can find they're really good at it they also said that they could fabricate mattresses it turns out they had never really done it before but we were in a rush to launch we were burning money and it turned out that we went through a huge amount of pain getting them up to speed to learn how to do this step in the process which is convert this raw foam as it comes off of a production line into a finished mattress it's a really simple process you cut the pieces to size and you glue them together and you put a cover on it it shouldn't be hard but it's very hard so if you're going to work in a manufacturing environment and hire a company right one of the things we learned is that you need to go step by step and make sure that they they can actually and already are actually doing everything that you're asking them to do every supplier or almost every supplier will tell you they can do far more than they can actually do and you need to figure out what they're actually really good at what their core competency is versus like what yours are and if you need to start bringing together multiple suppliers this supplier we also relied on them to do e-commerce distribution so moving those large mattresses to like a third-party logistics firm which is where most ecommerce products are distributed from is very expensive because they're so large you can only fit if we were going to sell it shirts I could fit thousands in a truck we can only fit 200 beds in a truck so it's very expensive to move them from the factory to a distribution center just to get shipped again so we had them do it we estimate that they cost us around 30 to 40 thousand dollars a month in lost product or miss ship product because we were relying on them to do something which they were not good at doing so when you're on the if you're on the factory floor there's a couple basic things to look for standard operating procedures force them to bring them out and show them to you QA checks do they have stations where they're monitoring quality do they actually have dedicated staff that's that's focused on continuous improvement and quality if you don't see people walking the floor doing quality work it it means they're they're not doing it at all in the factory inventory management tools and methods I think depending on the industry you're in they'll have different levels of sophistication of how they track the raw materials and finished goods we consign covers and a couple and boxes and a couple products that we purchase and give to our suppliers they maintain some of them maintain records through Excel spreadsheets which is terrible because we have no access to their Excel spreadsheets they're not currently updated so finding a supplier that has a good ERP so an enterprise resource tool is important from day one and a small last thing just as we should be careful what we dress like look at how they dress look at how their floor workers dress there's a in our experience a really strong correlation between how neat the people are and the quality of work they produce so people if the management gives everybody a polo shirt or a t-shirt that matches and look clean the odds are that the management cares more about the quality what they're going to produce join good company so there's a step in the manufacturing process for our product where you apply a water-based glue to a layer of foam and then you put another layer of foam on top of it if you put too little or too much it causes problems and so there's a small step you see going on here where they put a sample piece like every 10 or 20 or 30 beds they put a small piece of foam through and you weigh it before and you weigh it after and you weigh you weigh the difference and it tells you what the density of glue or the concentration of glue you're putting on the mattresses we have worked with factories that have done this and we worked with factories that haven't and one of the things we saw is that particularly for small companies like us from the grand scheme still small you guys small companies find suppliers that are working for very reputable established big companies in our industry the very best is IKEA if we find a company that's working for IKEA we know that all of these things which have caused us problems before are taken care of so when you show up at a new factory ask for their list of clients if they're working for somebody that you think is reputable so they get some flack like IKEA Nike Nokia they're good generally European companies or better than American companies in terms of what they force their supply chain to do so get two lists of clients ask for testing and inspection criteria so as a new company you're going to have to create a lot of processes in a lot of documents if you can just borrow and adapt stuff that up that large companies are already created you'll be in a much better place so they won't always share this with you because I don't think like IKEA would have been happy that our supplier shared their test document with us but our supplier did do that same with product specifications writing a solid product specification document takes a huge amount of work and that defines what you're actually going to pay the supplier to make so you want to make sure that it of like utmost thoroughness in detail getting a good template to start with is hugely valuable if you want to be green start green so the reason I bring this up is we we as a company we found that like selling an ecologic story is not it's it's not very marketable it doesn't make you sell more product but it's important to us so what we what we've done is on the quiet side gotten certification around components so if we look at the the raw materials that go in any off gas then it comes off the product the harvesting of any of those raw materials we look for certification around those individual things we ran into a little bit of problem because we'll be expanding into Europe and in Europe particularly in the german-speaking countries finished product and ecological certification is far more important to the consumer so we were like okay we're good we have all the certifications for this specifically for a pillow so this I didn't reference the picture but it's a weaving machine weaving cotton shelves for pillows we thought we would be good and so we thought we could use the same supply chain let's apply that product for Germany the problem is the certification required for Germany requires certified finished product and certified fact the factory that produces the finished product has to be certified so we're in the process of onboarding a totally new factory and totally new supply chain just to make a product for Germany because we didn't think ahead enough to get this this whole thing right for that market so get finished good certifications get factory level certifications again follow industry leaders if you follow a knight gear and IKEA or Nokia into a factory the odds are that there are eating to be compliant with ecological or environmental certifications and restrictions and then we're going through this right now some companies have done it doing a B Corp assessment or using it as a tool when you're starting up is a four they don't know it's a benefit corporation pretty self-explanatory on their website but it gives you a tool around community conditions social conditions environmental conditions it's a really nice checklist to start with suppliers are not your friends this one's hard to remember I hate to pick on Neal but this is Neal again I think we were drunk in a basement bar in Arkansas so my advice to you on this with suppliers buy your own dinner don't get drunk and if you're going to Asia don't go to karaoke because it's not really karaoke like it is back home and for the guys in the audience the girls there don't actually think you're attractive so there's a couple things here one I'm not going to jump ahead one slide and go back read this book if you haven't this explains all the reasons why you should do none of these things but unless you have spent 10 years in sales or really gifted natural salesman you are definitely outgunned by your supplier salespeople they use all the tools and their innate to them they love closing the deal they use all the tools as disposal to make you think that they're your friend I got invited to Las Vegas for free they're gonna put me up in a suite in the Cosmopolitan one guy invited me to his family's house on the coast of Georgia to meet his wife you wanted to go backpacking and it's I don't mean to be negative but they've all disappeared when we stop doing business with them so they're not real friendships they're friendships of convenience for the supplier and it's really hard when us when a supplier is willing to spend 100 bucks or 200 bucks on dinner for you to not take it my feeling is you're better off buying them dinner because they'll then become indebted to you vendor agreements again this is like a really sticky legal document the mattress shown on the left is our mattress made in a fact the mattress shown on the right is a competitor mattress where we started we were like in our opinion the first branded ecommerce company to enter the space by last count there's 41 companies doing what Casper does here domestically there's caught some in China some in India some in Mexico some in Australia they pop up all the time it's super frustrating as we've work with our suppliers to improve their processes to see competitor small competitor companies come in and gather the knowledge that we've helped them build and we've built ourselves so a vendor agreement for people that don't know is a legal contract between your company and your supply chain that governs how you guys work together and has all of these things who owns IP meaning if you're sitting talking with the supplier about how to improve your product or how to improve your manufacturing process and a new idea comes up do you own it or do they own it exclusivity are they allowed to make the exact same thing for a different company are they allowed to make anything in your category of products data sharing this one's important for us we we closely monitor the quality of the raw materials that go into the product we want to know on a day over day basis what the test data they're getting back you but they're not unless we're contractually obligated to send it to us unless they are they're less inclined to do it inventory management this gets back to what I mentioned before do they regularly report this and we can you can tie all this into a document that forces them change-of-control three of our main suppliers were purchased two weeks ago by a single private equity firm in New York City that's a change of control allows us to renegotiate the contract and there's some clauses in there which allow us to change our relationship with them chargebacks you're going to get poor quality products sometimes every every business does who pays for those who pays for the consequences of those warranty you definitely have to negotiate and pricing transparency which I'll get into on the next slide this is very sad for these two charts price to an index there are two major commodities that make a mattress you can see the pricing trends of those two major commodities from when we launched until now ones down 16 percent ones down 31 percent how much of that money do you think Casper saved 0 we didn't negotiate in two things we didn't negotiate in because we were at a rush we didn't negotiate in volume discounts and we didn't negotiate in any automated pricing changes for our particular product and it's going to be different for different products it's very easy to know what the raw material costs are going in because they're commodities you can purchase them you can track on the market if we had been smarter in the beginning we would have priced we would have had price to the index we won't capture all the savings but we should have captured half of it and it's you know I think the the first talk they talked about gross margins and this makes our business if we had captured these it would make our business two things one we'd be more profitable or two we could pass the savings on to our customers we didn't capture it so the only people benefiting from this are our suppliers which is now a private equity firm and then last summing all this up if I had if I had had or somebody else on our team had had experience in operations I wouldn't have had to learn the previous seven things on my own so my advice is if you're gonna if you're gonna have a physical product company you're going to distribute something higher internal ops expertise early it will pay for itself and as an example we have a sea ship a lot of stuff through ups we spend millions of dollars a year because it's not cheap to ship that box through ups we just paid the bills because they come in to accounting we had like a outsource to firm I forget what's called propeller doing our accounting they paid the bills we went back recently as we've we've recently hired a guy who came out of Amazon and will express in Black and Decker to run our ops team he started digging back through the bills there was a mattress I got shipped to Fiji for like $1400 of shipping there's no way we ship the mattress to Fiji but it was buried in our UPS bill we hired an analyst just to look at this we anticipate based on initial numbers that will save quite two to three hundred thousand dollars just by digging back through old bills and in Reverse charging ups on those bills so of the things other things to look at the main things sourcing having a dedicated person just out there looking for multiple suppliers when you're in a rush like we were you go to a smaller number because you got to got to make a decision to move fast logistics keeping track of how your product moves around warehousing you got to know what's in inventory we're planning you got to know particularly things that are long lead time if you got if you're going to be bringing anything in from China or Taiwan you're 90 days on the water just to get it here so you got to plan four or five six months out you got to anticipate and it's impossible when you're in a new company to get it right but you could do it much better than we did an analyst just to watch your bills these all these people you can think about as being free because they will save you money or you can do it the way we did it so I just leave with one message if you make a promise we make a promise to our customers in terms of the quality of the product the speed with which we want to deliver it you actually have to deliver on that promise as a startup you get a lot of grace people will forgive you for a while we think as the scale and the time we've been in the market people are no longer and I forgive Kasper for messing things up and so you where you have a little bit of a free time there and then it runs out for you to have actually deliver on the promise so I'll leave you with that and then I guess I think I'm going to take some Q&A Thank You Jeff hey Jeff thank you for your time I just want to ask you mentioned you should hire an internal ops person early is that the title of that person inside of another organization internal operations um yeah the guy we hired is VP of operations we have a director of supply chain each of those each of these things that I had here and again we're larger so we can afford more people we have people under each of these tasks love will have probably by the end of summer we'll have four people just doing sourcing so you operations is the general thing and then there's the sub task underneath that got it alright thank you yeah for sure I can you talk a little bit about your product development process and how you work with your customers to decide what that next product is going to be um yeah for sure so that's actually like one of my backgrounds in not in supply chain so I might spent a long time at IDEO so if you're familiar with that methodologies what we practice so we spent a lot of time talking to consumers so if we if we know we want to make a pillow we're going to go purchase all the things that are on the market dissect them do sleeve trials we're very fortunate to have a exceedingly large group of dedicated customers and this kind of virtual entity we've created called Casper labs I think there's like 15,000 members and if we want to do survey work or product testing work or at home interviews we oh so we'll reach out to that group and see if we can find participants but we combine that user research product analysis and then like a business analysis of what do we think the holes on the market are how how much value or dollar volume can we get through a product category and then we just follow the paths to through that process to figure out what we want to make thank you Jeff thank you guys all right

Andy Dunn is the founder and CEO of the iconic line of men's clothing, Bonobos. Andy and former roommate Brian Spaly started Bonobos while they were earning their MBA from Stanford. They started the business by selling pants out of their cars, at friends' weddings, and in their buddies' living rooms. 

The product -- great-fitting, stylish, quality-made pants -- was an instant hit, and the pair sold around 500 pairs before they even had a website. Bonobos has taken almost $130,000 in funding, with the bulk of those investments coming from angel investors. 

In this presentation, Andy explains the value of angel investors, compares them to vc investors, and goes through the tactics he used to raise money through angel investments.

I was walking over here with my parents today where's Mom and Dad all right they're somewhere here and they were saying what's hustle con I was saying it's a conference for people that don't know how to do anything um so I'm here to be a cheerleader for what do you do with your career if you don't know how to do anything and the first step is I my belief is you're going to need four things okay and the first of those four is inspired by my hometown Sports hero Walter pton and I call it tenacity so I'm a Chicago boy and living in New York right now but basically have got this belief that pretty much everything you need to know in life you can learn from from being a Chicago sports fan so I grew up the son of a Hindu mother and a Christian father so I didn't really have a religion I could attached to growing up but I wanted to believe in something so what I believe in is the Cubs right there's really no reason for Hope but every year we still believe that this is going to be our year and we have a Mecca that we go to which is called rly field we commune we have a spiritual Gathering nothing really goes that well but we come together anyway just sort of kind of like an organized religion way to think about it so why I love Walter pton is that he had an unbelievable career every touchdown he scored with about two exceptions he handed the ball to the ref and he's my role model for the first of four traits that you're going to need which is tenacity which is a Relentless desire to win a tremendous resilience in the face of uncertainty and then when you do succeed you hand the ball to the ra and after the game you give credit to your teammates I learned that from Walter the second thing that you're going to need comes from our Nam namesake the bonobo and I call it the ability to evolve so can you guys name the five Great Apes bonobos orangutangs G gorillas I think I heard chimps and what's the fifth humans that was really good okay it takes a long time to get to hu humans usually but yes we are great apes with opposable thumbs language fire and the ability to gossip bobos I would argue are the most evolved in some ways they've developed matriarchal societies with no violent conflict and if you look around the world today we could learn a lot from their willingness to get along with each other and how do they do it they put their women in charge they tolerate and celebrate gay and bisexual Behavior they have adult males who play with their children all the way late through adulthood they can be a bit of pedophiles so don't pay attention to that part ignore that um but this basically is the future of the human species and minus that one part and so when you think about the history of great apes if you look at the Congo River it separates bonobos from chimps and in chimps you have a typical male patriarchy played out a little bit like Hamlet or mcbf the number three chimp teams up with the number two they topple the number one really ugly things happen in the night and everyone wakes up screaming because the number one male chimp has been killed or been dropped down to a lower status and so I think this is slowly what we're doing as human beings which is where evolving our society to a gender parity a true partnership between the genders and we're treating minorities very differently that we have it's happening slowly but 2015 was a big year in the US if you're gay or bisexual and so when I think about evolutionary ability I think that this is the core to what you're going to need as a human being in life it's going to be core to how you build a great company is the ability to evolve to learn to grow to change your mind and I think it's the second ke ingredient after tenacity in becoming a great entrepreneur the third thing that you're going to need I call authenticity and so this is me and Brian spaly my co-founder in 2007 on the Inca tril and I like to say sometimes that I think Brian is the better entrepreneur of the two of us not only did he create better fitting men's pants but he then went and created a second company after we had a co-founder divorce in 2009 called Trunk Club and did an amazing go job with a trunk club and he definitely fits into the hustle con mode and what what we brought to the party were two things Brian bought these brought these amazing better fitting pants his basic observation was that pants don't really fit right if they're American cut they're too boxy if they're the European cut they're too tight and so he developed a pant that has a contoured waistband and so if you ever take off your belt and you see the way that your belt curves as you wear it our pant is built with that curvature in mind in fact this denim that I'm wearing if you're looking to do some shopping today it's called Jet Center denim it's got that curvature in the waist it's got a more tailored fit through the thigh and we offer it across Ross four different fit Silhouettes and then 40 sizes for each of those and that's only made possible with a digitally native model which was what I brought to the party this idea that Brands would be built digitally native and if you're a dork like me and you like to read medium late at night when you're trying to learn from other great entrepreneurs I recently wrote a note called digitally native vertical brands from bonobos and Men's Wear warie Parker and eyewear Casper and toughed needle and mattresses Chubbies and amazing men shorts ever Lane Monica and Andy interior Define and Furniture air Dollar Shave Club Harry's my opinion is these brands are the future of how Brands get built and we were really proud that bonobos was the first in 2007 we spent four years pioneering that model and then we discovered wait a second oh this model isn't that profitable how do we actually make money and we decided that there was going to be a way to make great stores and the stores are called guide shops raise your hand if you've been to a bonobo guide shop Okay so we've got a lot of work to do you come in you get fitted you get styled we offer you more fit and size Choice than would ever be possible in a traditional retail environment we offer you great customer service one: one think of it like a Mini Apple Genius bar on a day where Apple isn't that crowded and we then ship you the product so we remove from the equation the idea that you need to walk out and do your own fulfillment and what we put in is a lot more fit a lot more Choice a lot more color a lot more print and a he a lot better customer service and so our authenticity for that is what's Driven this company and so don't think about a company that's going to make you money think about a company that you would do in a world where there was no money and you may be on the right track the last thing that you're going to need is magnetism and the magnetism to attract talent and capital and anything the company needs at all times and this is easy to do at the beginning when it's a bright-eyed Dream It's hard to do later when you actually discover that things don't go exactly as you planned and you go through difficult times and you go through moments where you don't think you're going to make it and you have to somehow summon enough self-belief that you're going to make it at the same time as you reconcile the doubt of the issues that you're facing and in the midst of that attract more people retain the people that you have and if need be the capital to your Venture and so these four things together I call no I in team and so this is a picture me and my dad who's the most selfless person that I know LED our family as a great dad and never really felt like he had to take credit never felt like he was going to do anything but take out the garbage clean the kitchen after my mom cooked dinner and this selflessness is fundamental to the humility that people really want to follow and I learned it from my dad so please give it up for him he's in the audience here today what my dad's not good at is raising money he's a history teacher so let's talk about how do you raise money so I have learned a lot about this because I'm the founding CEO of bonobos I'm a board member at four other brands including interior Define which is a digitally native furniture brand out of Chicago Monica and Andy which I'm building with my sister a digitally native vertical baby brand hinge uh which is a dating company and didn't even have time to update the slide but a brand called air ayr.com which is a women's brand that we incubated inside bonobos and spun out and then I've invested both personally and through a fund called red Swan in a bunch of other companies about this point about 50 other companies where I get to be an angel investor and it's a privilege by the way I don't recommend doing this it's uh not that focused there's a lot going on and so I talk a lot about um getting one thing right if if you want to get something off the ground what you want to do is get one product right and so one of the things that I've written about if you want to raise money build a great product and here's where I tipped my cap to my co-founder Brian spaly so this is a product called the Turks and it was one of our first products it was a pin whale lightweight corduroy it had a great contrast pocketing liner it had the curve curved waistband and we basically launched bonobos behind eight Styles eight different colors of this pinwell corduroy product that was all we had and on just that product this is what we did so we got to about 50,000 run rate selling corduroy pants to our friends at Stanford and when you have a few thousand from selling stuff to your friends you have nice friends but when you have $50,000 and you're not selling drugs you might have a business and so what you want to see is can you get to can you get to $50,000 of trailing Revenue in about 6 months and if you're doing that then maybe you're on to something and obviously if you're building an Enterprise software company or a SAS company this doesn't apply but we're at hustle con where a lot of us are trying to build physical products we're trying to build things that exist in the real world it's not a conference aimed at people who are doing technical softwar driven products see if you can get to $55,000 and at that point go try to raise money don't necessarily try to raise money beforehand and if the question is well how do I do this you've got to find enough money somewhere for inventory but if you can't shake down you know $20,000 out of your Rich aunt or if you can't find a way to get that first little slug of capital from somewhere you're probably unlikely to get to that second step when you're talking to people who maybe aren't related to you and so what you're going to discover is a concept that my one of my friends who's an entrepreneur his grandmother used to call Supply is infinite you know there is an infinite supply of capital in this world the number of rich people in this world is staggering it's one of the the smallest problems we have with Society we don't have too many rich people we have plenty it's a good thing because rich people can do things like make investment and investment from a macroeconomic perspective is what drives our economy and so when you take the perspective that just because someone said no doesn't mean that everyone's going to say no it probably just means that like 53 more people are going to say no before someone says yes and so you have to have that resilience and tenacity to power through that and the magnetism self-belief to keep going but just keep going don't worry I think literally a thousand people have said not to me on the way up in obos we raised our first $8 million from 104 people because we had zero institutional Capital support and then one day in 2010 for whatever reason the universe changed we were three years into it I saw two Venture Capital firms that were making investments in e-commerce one called Excel who invested in ModCloth another one called light speeed who invested invested in SHO Dazzle and later Honest Company and those became our Venture Capital firms but that was after 3 years of taking the perspective that Supply is infinite and virtually every Venture Capital round we've raised at bonobos has required this tremendous sense that we're going to find it somewhere in this face of an significant amount of rejection okay so now you've got a product that works you've got the four qualities that are required and you've got money how do you build a great culture I think building a great culture is a little bit like making a Mexican mole and so somewhere in here just pretend like you saw a slide about mole it's got all these ingredients that are really hard to figure out you know it's like if you ever had a good mole it takes like 20 to 25 ingredients and so if it tastes bad you don't know why and so most companies don't have a good culture mostly they're bad but no one knows why but everyone talks about why culture matters and why they want a great culture and frequently they lie to themselves about having a great culture and so one of the only ways to figure it out is you got to look at Employee Engagement scores and you've got to be willing to talk to people who are at the ground level in your organization and you've got to look at turnover and you've got to look at your ratings on glass door and you have to internalize all these problems as your own uh which I call it's all your fault you know founding CEO is a beautiful job because everything is your fault it's not even like being a US president where you can just blame blame it on the last person uh founding CEO you start of the company so it's all your fault so how do you make a great culture in my opinion it starts with having a mission and a vision that people understand and so at our company we have this brand story and purpose that we talk about the evolution of mankind starting with pants and saying you know what we have great fit and we have great customer service but how do we actually have a story about what we're doing that matters more we reinvented the fit of a men's pant we've now brought that to Great shirts and suits with products like Our Daily Grind dress shirt which we're about to release Lee with an amazing foolproof elbow and that's got the same kind of concept of fit or the jet Setter suit and then by the way we don't think traditional retail stores work so we're going to reinvent that what might we reinvent next and bringing that sense of passion for a mission as the number one hiring criteria and making sure people care about this so how do you test it the way that you test it in my opinion is you make someone two offers you offer them one cash offer with more stock and then you offer them higher cash with lower stock and if they go for higher cash and lower stock you try to talk them out of taking the job the second thing that you need to do is figure out if they're aligned with your core virtues or core values so we at bonobos talk about these five core virtues or human values that we look for are you positive do you put more Goodwill than you take out doesn't have to mean you're gregarious or sociable you can be a positive introvert you can feel it in someone's spirit usually I can tell right at the beginning of meeting someone do they have positive energy the second is intellectual honesty I like to ask people in interviews when's the last time you change your mind or what's the thing that you most passionately believed at one point in your life that you no longer believe if someone sits there and goes uh I don't know probably not someone you want to hire you need people who can look at data and change their minds judgment the best way to evaluate judgment is all the decisions someone has made in their life up until until the moment that you met them you can usually tell if someone has Judge good judgment just from looking at LinkedIn does their career make sense are they making good decisions about where they go judgment is about do you make good decisions in the face of uncertainty you don't even need to meet someone to figure out if they have good judgment empathy do they think about the world from the perspective of other people you know most of us spend our lives inside our own heads it's remarkable how little other people actually care about us and yet we assume they do most most of us are spending 99% of our energy thinking about ourselves and so just the ability to carve off maybe 20% of your energy and imagine it from the world of the perspective of others this is what bonobos teach us although they have less language capabilities supposedly they're more empathetic and they're less they're they're more likely to be imagining that world which is incredible thing to think about and then lastly self-awareness you know it's sad but the research shows that other being other than being tall white in mail and named John the highest criteria of Fortune 500 CEOs are two things the ability to make good analogies and being self-aware and Daniel Goldman has written an amazing article about this called self-awareness what makes a leader which is if you want to cultivate the one thing that you can control that is likely to make you a great leader it's self-awareness it's the ability to be non-defensive about the things about you that suck to understand your weakness and to be able to talk about them with other people in the room and then to own your power own your strengths to be unafraid of it these are the five ingredients that we look for at bobos and most importantly we fire on these five core values so you try to hire on them but you're frequently going to get it wrong or I should say you're not infrequently going to get it wrong hopefully you get it right most of the time but when you don't as they say at Netflix adequate performance has to get generous Severance and performance has to be cultural performance as well well and ultimately you want to hire people that know what they're doing you can't hire someone to be lead violin who's not a violinist but my belief is you hire for passion for the mission and fit with your core human values above experience usually you're hiring someone who's about to do it rather than someone who's just done it and I think ultimately this is the most elegant challenge in business which is can you build a company that is loved by your employees because if your company is loved by your employees shareholders holders are going to be happy and customers are going to be happy too no one likes to work at a company where the customers don't like the product or the service or the bundle thereof and no company ever thrives that has got a great culture and that's not serving customers well so I think that what Wall Street would like to teach us is shareholders come first customers second employees come third and I would suggest that we should invert that put employees at the top do a phenomenal job with that of course they will serve customers well and then shareholders will be taken care of and by the way your employees are the only people who are thinking about what you do every day they're investing their entire livelihoods outside of their families whereas a customer might think about you once a day if you're lucky and your shareholder thinks about you a lot when the quarterly earnings come out and so when it comes to leadership I would suggest taking the opposite perspective of Charles de gal which is when I want to know what France thinks I ask myself and instead take the perspective of an Eastern philosopher Lau who says a leader is best when people barely know he exists when his work is done his aim fulfilled they will say we did it ourselves and so if you've had some success now what to do don't become annoying don't let success get to your head and I take this next section as advice for myself right which is that there's this pernicious force in human nature which is hubris and it comes with success don't let your feet leave the ground keep it firmly planted remember that everything that you've done the further along you get has less and less to do with you and more and more to the people that you're attracting to your Venture and who are doing incredible work you are doing less and less and less and less and less over time so you have less and less to your credit as time goes on and be a wary of the stories in human history and in human mythology about what happens when your feet do leave the ground this is a picture of Kendrick Lamar who wrote a great song on his Emmy wining winning album that talks about a beggar and how that beggar might actually be God and I love that song because it's a mental trick which is just because you're quote unquote powerful and someone else's powerless doesn't mean that it should change anything about your kindness toward them and if you want to hear a great song that will make you think and really kind of trip you out consider that other people who are successful and Powerful are precisely the people that you need be the least concerned about and the people who have not had the privilege that you've had you must think of in the inverse way be forgiving to yourself This is a tough clicker but I'm going to get it be forgiven to yourself by being forgiving to others you're going to make huge mistakes so you have to learn to forgive yourself and you'll learn to do the same thing to others this becomes particularly important as a boss you're The Shepherd of the way that other people feel about their performance and then lastly a tribute to my mom practice good judgment without being judgmental um and I learned that from you mom so please one more round of applause for the leader who I most [Music] admire the final thing I have to say before just maybe some brief questions is my favorite home on resilience and it's called um never give up it's by the do Lama never give up no matter matter what is going on never give up develop the heart too much energy in your country is spent developing the Mind instead of the heart I think he means America be compassionate not just to your friends but to everyone be compassionate work for peace in your heart and in the world work for peace and I say again never give up no matter what is happening no matter what is happening around you never give up and I was on the phone with my sister this morning she's working through a fundraise for her company Monica and Andy it's every bit as tough as all the fundraises that that I've ever been through and I've been through eight and I said it's like a journey song Don't Stop Believing and as long as you believe in yourself you'll get it done thank you very [Applause] [Music] much hey we have time for like two to three questions if people want to come down I actually have a question myself huge uh onova customer I think I have like 16 pairs of pants it's kind of weird um but one thing you didn't you kind of touched on didn't really talk about a lot is I think you guys have fantastic customer service I know that's becoming kind of a thing where people are starting to realize that's really important there's a lot of tools out there that help you you know be really efficient when it comes to customer service but what's your kind of stance on the you know importance of that and from a brand perspective I think it's if you look at just our so our net promoter score now is running around 80 and if you look at just our clothing products we're going to be between 50 and 65 depending on the product so we're adding somewhere between 15 and 30 points just from customer service and it's the ninjas and the guide shops so part of the reason why I'm so bullish on digitally native vertical Brands like bonobos and like warb and like this whole ecosystem is that you can fundamentally bundle service together with assortment and we found that it comes in three ways it's about the right technology enablement of service so fewer contacts you actually want to drive down your your contacts per order through great web and mobile experience it's it's about having great online service which in our case is the ninjas who if you look at the ninjas they have an NPS of 90 and then now it's about the offline and having the offline have less Inventory management and more customer service so I think it's a huge part of the whole experience thanks for the question you mentioned earlier uh once you hit the $50,000 run rate maybe time to start raising some money um what are your thoughts on bootstrapping versus raising I think they both are extremely viable paths I think that that if you have an ambition to control your own destiny more fully and your instincts are you want to kind of keep it and maybe have it for longer and have higher percent ownership I think that bootstrapping can be a phenomenal path I think that raising capital is if you start to get wider eyes about the opportunity and you want to accelerate but I think both are unbelievably viable ways to build something and I think where you get into trouble is where you end up doing something that's inauthentic so I've seen a friend of mine who started a business raise capital for it even though he's a bootstrapper by heart and he was miserable right because of that pressure and that expectation and I've seen the flip of it which is someone that really wanted to go for it and they couldn't raise capital and they were miserable by that so I think you got to look for that authentic it all comes back to authenticity thank you thank you hi my name is George thanks for Andy what's up man uh my my company cotton Brew uh we make men's Weare and we're in the process of starting the fundraising and uh you know we want to reach out to angels and and you know you mentioned you guys raised from know over 100 Angels initially what what would you recommend as far as finding the relevant Angels so that reach out to them scalably it's two things so 99.9% of angels don't want to invest in your company is just kind of a way to think about any company so you got to find that 0.1% and I think the number one F way to find the 0.1% is people who've invested in similar comp similar kinds of companies because then you don't have to filter for will they do a consumer retail investment will they do a consumer retail menare investment that's number one and then number two I think the best source of angel investor recommendations is other entrepreneurs who say those angels are good so whenever you meet an entrepreneur say hey do you have any Angel Investors that you really like write down those write down those names and then ask them would you be open to making an intro let me send you my presentation or let me share with you what I'm doing would you be open to seeing if that angel investor wants to meet me okay thank you good luck hi my name is shanet kisik I am the founder of the shopping service V L uh it's an IOS app uh we are just before we have reached our product Market fit and we're about to grow what is your key advice when it comes to growing and scaling in in terms of customer base you know I I had a moment at bobos where we had product Market fit and I thought I was done and then I realized that there was this other part which is customers and growing customers in this whole challenge of customer acquisition and I think that one of the mistakes that I made was assuming that doing more marketing would help me grow product Market fit to equaling more revenue and what I've learned is sometimes if you're not seeing the business take off in a more organic way it means that your product Market fit is not a 10x the next product and so bonobo spent four years growing the business quite nicely but really by spending money on marketing through venture capital in a way that wasn't actually great from a long-term perspective and it wasn't until we invented the guid shop model and did the partnership ship with our phenomenal Partners at Nordstrom and started developing a print catalog and doing some kind of contrarian things for a digital brand that we really took off and so sometimes you have to think about your product experience as being something you want to extend into new categories and new channels rather than just marketing the existing bundle of product and Market that you have thank you I I think we found the same way we did some Facebook and Instagram Marketing in the beginning and when we didn't have more fun for that we had to kind of be more smart about it it gets expensive right exactly thank you very much and not and not smart enough either yes but thank you thank you all right that's all the time you have thank you much so much everybody thank you thanks man all right

really good to be here this is Annie go go we're on there yeah we're on a mission to empower people to unite around the ideas that matter to them and together bring those ideas to life what we stand for is we believe every idea deserves a shot if you're willing to work hard if you're willing to hustle it's not luck it's not privilege that shouldn't matter it should be how hard are you willing to work to bring your idea to life and the reason I'm really passionate about this is this is a fun clicker the reason I really fast about this is because I grew up watching my parents struggle for 30 years trying to bring their business to life and grow their business from a small business into a larger business and it sucked it was hard hurdles every step of the way funding being a huge one of them and then when I got to New York and started understanding money and started working with actually filmmakers and theatre producers on the side I ran into the exact same challenges I actually had this event where I got a theatre like this with an audience like this we put up a one-night event of an Arthur Miller play about racial profiling this was right after September 11th I got investors there to witness the whole thing so that they loved it and write the check at the end of the night based on the audience response and everything went perfect except that last moment when they said this was amazing we're not investing good luck not our cup of tea and it was in that moment that I realized why entrepreneurship was so freaking hard it's because the people who wanted something to come to life in this case the actors and the audiences they didn't actually have the power to make it happen and they were completely dependent on these other third party gatekeepers so that's what we changed I've teamed up with my co-founders which is a whole nother story and together we launched IndieGoGo today we've had over 5,000 a hundred thousand campaigns in every country of the world I'd even know there's more than 200 and almost a billion dollars distributed and we're actually two sites now we have IndieGoGo calm which is really focused on all of our entrepreneurial ideas filmmakers startups drones whatever you want to bring to life we help you coffee shops it's all they are and generosity which is our free sister site for personal causes nonprofits people doing stuff more focused on on I'm bring good into the world and so in the process of starting IndieGoGo though we actually ended up inventing an industry as Sam called it and we have people like the prior speakers come up and have enormous success getting their businesses off the ground this way and in the process we've also done something amazing which I'm personally proud of is we have removed the requirements of luck and Prejudice and all that in your success now it just means you have to hustle and for that reason we have things like on any gogo 41% of all the campaigns they reach their funding target that are entrepreneurial are run by women but in venture capital world that's only less than 10% a lot of bias there but what IndieGoGo is proving is that women hustle just as much as men and we're just as entrepreneurial and because of that we're just as successful and in the process now what we've realized is we're actually doing it again and we're doing more than just funding we invented crowdfunding almost ten years ago and now we're actually branching out we're actually helping customers all throughout the entire journey from start to finish we're doing work with partnerships like with Brookstone and manufacturers to help products once they get their funding to go all the way to the finish line and become really big businesses which is amazing and we're doing it again so what I want to talk to you guys about today is the challenge for us is there's no blueprint for inventing industries we're not trying to be a better faster cheaper version of something else we're trying to do something a whole new way and for that the way you you solve that is it all comes down to your team who's your team and they've three ingredients of a team that can innovate and figure this out our diversity mission and values diversity stat is the statistics are out there something's not popping up but it has been proven time and time again the more diverse your team the more productive you are the more creative you are the more engaged they are the more innovative you are so the key is when you're starting a company make it diverse at IndieGoGo and was 50% of our team is women that's crazy in the tech land but I think it's because of that that we've been so effective of actually serving our customers and maybe that's why women are so successful in IndieGoGo the key tips here and how you how do you become diverse there's a lot of great research you want to cast your wide net you want to make sure you remove all unconscious bias from the hiring process but you guys are startup you're hustlers your you know teams of ones and two here you don't have masses but massive budgets to go recruit and hire anybody you want so my tip here is the way to okay sorry about that the way to get around that is just start to burst when you start to verse you're basically your recruiting strategy is who are your friends who's in your network who's your friends on Facebook and so if you start diverse then you actually will recruit diverse and you'll build a team that actually is a bunch of people who think different act different come from different backgrounds believe different things have different skill sets look different all that good stuff plus unconscious bias is something that's really really freaking hard we all are biased I'm biased just admit it we spent a lifetime understanding what our biases and let's be conscious to them but at least when you start diverse and have a group of people with all kinds of biases it evens out so no one bias can control the others and send you want to put on a path to building a non innovative company the second ingredient to building an innovative team is having a really strong mission and hiring people that are mission driven so clearly we've done a lot of work to really focus on why we exist that's to unite people around the ideas that matter to them and empower them to bring those people those ideas to life notice funding is not in this title because we're doing more than funding but because of that we've attracted the most amazing mission driven people and the reason why you need mission driven people is because when you're innovating and creating something you don't have this blueprint and you have all these diverse people so you have lots of different ambitious ideas what brings them all together and what focuses them is your is your mission is your guiding light plus when people are Purpose Driven they are far more productive far more creative and far more innovative so that is what you want to do and they're really good at opportunity spotting which is what innovation is again it's you're not following any blueprint so my advice to you and how to make sure your you have a good mission is just ask yourself five the five why's why are you doing this ask yourself again and again and again and get yourself to a point where the answer to why you're starting this business or this company that you're doing is an irrational belief it's just what you believe there's no rationality involved and if you can get to a place like that you know you've got a strong lie and that will be the guiding light for your company the third ingredient of an innovative team is culture it's it's the culture is what brings everybody together and culture is not ping pong tables it's not free food yes that's part of it maybe a lot here in some tally but that is not what culture is culture are your values when you have a diverse group of people who are ambitious about trying to achieve something really massive which is your mission this is on the left is what happens they will want to go every different direction but it's your values it's your culture which is I think one in the same that bring everybody into alignment for us fearlessness for example is one of our values and what that means is that tert fearlessness at IndieGoGo means turning challenges into opportunities to innovate when people share their values even though they have different opinions and different backgrounds and look different but when they share their values they actually can get something done together imagine if you're someone who likes to innovate and every time you see a challenge and you see that as an opportunity to do something new and you're trying to work with someone who runs into a challenge and they see it as a reason to give up that's very frustrating so when you have when you're clear on what your values are people when they're working together spend more time actually getting work done than figuring out how to work together and it's clear companies with strong cultures once again completely outperform our more innovative creating way more value than companies without a lot of data so how do you do that we've put ourselves through an exercise okay we put ourselves through an exercise very early on in IndieGoGo and that's where we basically sat ourselves down and asked ourselves to draw up six pictures that answer the questions I love coming to work at IndieGoGo because and in that process we did a little show-and-tell it was really funny I learned that design was not a strength on our team and they were gonna have to figure that out soon but we learned that we all came to work for the same four reasons and that was we wanted to change an industry we weren't afraid of doing it fearlessness we wanted to bring our whole selves to work not wear any kind of physical or metaphorical uniforms anymore we wanted to be authentic we wanted to work with others and win with others playing alone solo sports not our thing we liked winning together we'd like to collaborate and empowerment we wanted to spend our waking days helping people that wanted to be helped you guys wanting to bring your ideas to life empowerment and then the next step we did which didn't happen right away but took a few years and this is why I'm sharing this is our learnings is then once you start to hire people and get to you know dozens you know we're now over a hundred people you need to actually articulate what behaviors that must people embody every single day to truly exhibit and embody these values and so we did work even but got the entire company we went through in a painstaking way and really distilled from us what is it that we do when we're performing at our best being the most creative most innovative most collaborative all this stuff what is it that we're doing that makes it worth it and we clarified those behaviors we put them on paper and we hold ourselves to it from there you then hire for this fit you don't just hire for skills fit but you get really ruthless about hiring people for culture fit which is literally those who authentically embody your values you don't want to change anybody once they hire once you hire them you want them to bring their authentic self and if they're getting to be themselves and feel whole at work they will be again more alive more engaged more productive and then you want to recognize people for it we have it can be very heavy I don't recommend that it can be a very lightweight way to just honor the people when somebody really shows their fearlessness or shows their collaboration we honor it every quarter we have eggies it's a ton all hands people just give awards out to each other for folks who are examples of embodying our values and when you do that the last thing you want to do I know culture and all this stuff feels very soft it's really not this is again crucial to growth and actually innovating and build something meaningful and you can actually measure it and we do so again the point of innovation is you have to be you want people engaged and the more engaged they are the more productive and we measure both for example we've created an employee NPS survey that everybody takes once a month and we do report cards on ourselves in our productivity how well are we achieving our goals Gordon Lee and ironically I actually just did a quick r-squared correlation analysis the better we perform more effectively are the more engaged we are the r-squared is quite high the correlation is quite high so I just want to leave you with my final thoughts here it's all you know hustling here we're trying to start stuff we're trying to innovate we're trying to build new things just want to remind you that the point of all of this the point is not just to be innovative the point is not just to be entrepreneurial don't become an entrepreneur because you want to be an entrepreneur don't become an entrepreneur because you just want to innovate always remember that innovation or entrepreneurship journey is a means to a greater end it so it means that mission and if you remember that you actually can do something great and if you forget you'll get lost and you won't be successful and then people like this will start talking to you stop talking about you which this just happened so thank you for your time today good luck we are all about empowering entrepreneurs we have team in San Francisco that will help you all kinds of resources email me at today at IndieGoGo calm if you want to get connected to anybody thank you

Headspace is a meditation app that makes it easy to practice mindfulness, even if just for 5 minutes a day. 

Andy Puddicombe was in college when he decided to quit school and become a monk. Almost a decade later, he started a business where he helped executives reduce stress through meditation. It was here that he met his future co-founder, Rich Pierson. 

Andy and Rich eventually realized that meditation should be available to everyone, and that they were the ones who could make it happen. Now Headspace is a household name, and popular among engineers and celebrities alike. 

In this video, entrepreneur Eva Ho interviews Andy and Rich onstage at Hustle Con, and finds out the tactics these founders used to take their business to the next level.

the time to really sort of mind the wisdom on the stage here so Andy your mom showed sort of meditation to you when you were younger like 10 or 11 years old how did that still inspire your journey to becoming later on become a monk sort of a decade later in spending the journey traveling the world share a little bit of that with us given it's a very unconventional path to running one of the best startups hey I'm very good afternoon everybody it is in his a has a long story to fit into just a few sentences but um he I learned I learned meditation was about 11 years old with my mom very progressive kind of mom and bit of a hippie and um and it wasn't until really kind of my late teens that I found it I really understood how valuable and useful it could be I think when I was younger so it was a nice thing to do it's quite relaxing I think it was only later on when my mind started to get really busy and my you know emotions started to overwhelm me a little bit more that I really understood kind of how powerful it could be and yeah it was you know he was a couple of couple of really difficult sort of situations events unfolding the friends family that I lost in my my late teenage years there really kind of spurred me on to think okay I want to understand the mind not from a text book not from other people's opinions but really to kind of look at the mind and understand it and that's what drove me to quit my university degree and go away and become a monk yeah pretty wild how do you guys you guys like is this voice or how many of you guys use headspace I know it's dark out there recognises crazy voice thank you for using his place guys this is what he looks like right here so I think it also really began when you ran into this person here mr. rich so when you guys met each other you were an ad agency exec how did it what was that sort of meeting like and the subsequent meetings how did this all come about in terms of you guys deciding what you wanted to solve hi Ron um yeah so we got introduced by a mutual friend and I been working in advertising agency I said and I'd burn out pretty bad and it was in a really not in a good spot would be fair to say and my friend said you should go me Andy's he's been teaching me meditation and my friend was like the last person that I ever thought would be meditation so that in itself was kind of surprising and he said yeah he used to be a Buddhist monk and he's got a clinic in in London teaching people one-on-one so they all sounded very normal and and we met each other and I think we kind of we both got on immediately and I started practicing meditation we did a bit of a skill swap and into a meditation I came up with a few ideas for his clinic and it was very organic I would go over the road there was a coffee shop over the road and we'd spend an hour together and we just chat and about six months you know about six months went by and we kind of both decided that you know actually that we should try and do this and and his pitch to me was like I can't afford to pay you but you want to come and work you want to come and do this and that remained I pitched to all the people we took on for a long period of time as well thankfully they came anyway yes right so when you said we're gonna do this what is this how did it start well the original I think the original idea that we talked about was like how could we create the kind of Nike+ of meditation that was the original kind of brief I thought was an interesting parallel that they'd taken running which have been seen as a kind of boring pursuit and they'd made it social they've made it engaging they made it fun again and we kind of felt that you know meditation there was something in that but I'd let you tell the story out the the digital thing versus the event piece yeah so which has some fun with this you know as you can imagine coming out of a monastery I didn't know a lot about technology truth is I didn't really know much about anything other than meditation and you had a sit quietly with my eyes closed ah which is an entrepreneur I personally I still think it's quite a valuable skill but you know which was less sure and we were talking about kind of how to scale it in which was telling me about this this this Nike blast thing you know and I had no idea what he was talking about and I'm not even sure I had a mobile phone at the time I was a very late adopter and and so it for me like I'd only I'd come from a lineage in a tradition where it was always handed down sort of person to person so I couldn't imagine it another way you know so I said okay well instead of doing that why don't we do events and we actually ran you know we ran events for probably two years before we even considered making an app so we you know I know the the theme of the the conference is hassle we really it really felt like for the first two or three years that's all we did was hustle and we were hustling to get people to event and we were hustling to get meetings we were saying yes to anybody that would offer us a meeting or an audience and not laugh at us for what we were trying to do and we you know we really that was a massive part of how the app you know came came to be so it seems like like many entrepreneurs and many under the audience of it was a period of experiment experimentation a period of ramen noodles and not making a lot of money from the events there was a point in time where it kind of took off tell us what that point was and how did you arrive at that point well I think it I'm not sure whether yeah there was definitely a point when I think we kind of felt that it changed we we were down to our last like 50,000 bucks and the events although they were fantastic because they were kind of an amazing chance to see people face-to-face and talk about what they wanted and I think that affected the product that you kind of see today and the one that was before that but basically we want to do an event in New York and we'd met someone they said have you ever thought about doing this is a subscription and the business wasn't working no one was going to give us any more money and so we had 50,000 bucks left and we beg stilled and borrowed basically to get that thing made all the animations got done for free all of the audience they saw we're friends and family really but all the audio got recorded for free well the video got recorded for free the agency that built the the website and the app did an 80% reduction just because they kind of believed in kind of what we were doing and then we convinced the Guardian which is a big paper in the UK to put a million booklets on the front of every single Guardian newspaper and it had an offer for the subscription and in that first month that we launched in January you know we took I never remember I never forget I was watching the money kind of come in like by the hour I kept refreshing it going oh my god we've got a business that actually works and we took thirty six thousand pounds in that first January to put that in perspective that is about as much money as we made in the previous 18 months so I think at that point we thought there's something there's something in this from a business point of view and that could work there's a great lessons for true bootstrapping so going from with less than $50,000 cash in it back to 40 million dollars recently raised both of you are non-technical founders a how did that happen like how did you accomplish that I have no idea still to this day you know I'm gonna try and answer that I do a lot of lepre I'll let rich answer it you know from a technical point of view or you know like how how it's actually happened but I do believe that if you have a passion but we never set out with the idea of like let's make a billion dollar company you know that wasn't kind of what we were saying out to do we set out because we believed in something and we had a passion about something we knew that it had the potential to be commercially sustainable Andy been successful but that's not what we were kind of doing and why we were doing it and I still believe now that if you set out with that in mind and you there's no fear because what have you got to lose there is nothing to lose so I feel like we've always kind of worked in that way and believed that anything is possible and I think still to this day both of us we are naively optimistic and we really do kind of live day-to-day as though anything is possible and when you live like that there is at least the opportunity or possibility for anything to happen I'd say the other thing is that the support around the mission and kind of what we try to do the people have been willing to help either your classic kind of case in point I think people have really rallied behind what we've been doing because they believe in what it's actually putting out in the world and I think that has that's made a huge difference like the amount of help that people gave us in those early days especially not just were giving us stuff for free but their time and their contacts and you've got to meet this person and like when Andy got his TED talk that was you know really driven by you know a friend that really kind of pushed for that to happen in it and it did and it was a big thing for us at that time that was a huge huge deal so and I could list millions of things but I do think that that has really kind of helped propel it more than more than normal and I think the the other bit and all of you guys will relate to this I'm sure is recognizing what our strengths are and also I lack of in many different areas and so finding the right people you know just as from the very beginning we didn't want to do everything ourselves and we knew we couldn't do everything ourselves so really working hard to bring in the right people who could do the job much better than we ever could dream of doing you know and and it's a it's a team thing you know it's nice that people come up and say hey I love headspace well done and congratulations it's not us you know there's a team of 100 people kind of doing this you know and it's growing every week and so it's the team that kind of make it happen you two are always always a super humble and I think element of a little bit of luck in everybody's life but certainly I don't think you guys arrived here accidentally and it's not what you guys are saying but in terms of thinking of the scale you're at today over seven million users almost 200 countries and it's wonderful in the backstage to see all these folks walking up and say hey oh my god it's you guys it's your voice it's it's quite an amazing accomplishment talk to folks out here who are just getting started who are working with hustling who are trying to bootstrap give them some nuggets of how did you what are some things that you would say I mean you guys never had a big team never hired people before never led a big project give us some things on how we got here I mean personally I'd say look go off to the Himalayas shave your head become among a nun for ten years it's easy um no I look I think there are so many different ways to this but I would say I'm gonna do kind of maybe the clarity element unless you really kind of a clear unless you know what it is you want to achieve and where you want to get to it's highly unlikely you're going to get there you know same for all of us and and I do think so often we start with an idea but and the idea is great but the idea is also very vague and we kind of we set out on this journey and unless it's really of course you want to be open and open to possibilities along the way but we kind of really need to know where we're heading for whether it's in six months one year three years five years and I really believe kind of in if you refine that from the very beginning of course is going to change along the way it sounds obvious you know but for me it's something I've had to learn as we've gone along the way you know we started off with a very general idea but we've had to really refine that destination again and again and again and it's still being refined but unless that's clear in the mind then I think it's really difficult to put it off and yeah I think that piece around passion like fast the you know both personally this is it doesn't really feel like a job because the meditation bit is the thing that we're most passionate about you know inside of work and outside of work so it doesn't ever feel like work and I know that I've we're really lucky that we have that and we talk about that a lot I do think there's a lot of frivolous stuff that gets made in the world not just in tech just generally and I think there's some amazing stuff that is trying to you know deal with really big issues that need to be fixed and solved by really smart people like yourselves and I think trying to match that kind of passion with kind of something that's going to have genuine impact and I do think that there's so many areas that need the need help that for me feels like something because it's so hard doing this every day and keep doing it I do think you have to have that to keep that kind of hunger and passion going otherwise I think it's really really difficult we were talking about life we were selling widgets I'm not sure that we'd be we'd be very successful because we're terrible at selling widgets in terms of just along the way in that you've been around for about six years your business are there specific people books resources that you've lied on for both education on how to be a leader how to be a founder or just for inspiration are the things that you guys lean on yeah I mean I don't know if I can talk for both of us I think I probably can we the truth is we probably should read a lot more about what just generally but a lot more about entrepreneurship and about leadership and all of those things are we don't our which is definitely better at it than than I am we both take our our inspiration from books about great meditation masters and it might sound strange and you might kind of think well what's the relevance you know but actually so much of not only understanding kind of where we want to go is understanding our own mind but so much of understanding our own mind helps us understand the minds of others and when you're trying to build an organization and when you're trying to kind of create a culture hopefully of kindness and creativity and authenticity which for us or the the three kind of key key parts of that team and it becomes really relevant to what's going on in in your mind and I really feel like read those stories you know and reflect on those ideas for both of us we try and bring those into the workplace every single day they might feel at first when you read them a bit so esoteric and a bit kind of you know they belong somewhere else in another part of the world but actually if you if you really take them and you spend time to understand them they're incredibly relevant and incredibly useful so I don't know if it's appropriate or not but there's just a couple you know that I really would recommend regardless even if you're not interested in meditation and that kind of thing there's one called Zen mind beginner's mind by a Japanese Zen monk called Suzuki Roshi the guy was a genius and he basically introduced meditation to the West in the way that we know it now and in fact he was he was local he was up in San Fran and I think he made a massive impact and if ever your mind feels really kind of busy and you're just too caught up in thinking that's a great book to read where he just helps you kind of zoom out and you just get a very different perspective on your own mind and on whatever's going on around you and the other one is um it's a little more challenging but it's called cutting through spiritual materialism and I think it's brilliant for a Western audience and it's by a Tibetan teacher and he just blows away all the myths that we might have around kind of meditation and spirituality and all these things and it just says how is it relevant to what's going on in your life right now and I think for entrepreneurs it's a it's a really useful book it's great to hear about you rich anything you know I as Annie says these are the books that we kind of talk about and discuss a lot and I think when when Andy first taught me meditation these were the places that he directed me and at first I found them they were quite quite difficult first the kind of to kind of understand some the language and did it make sense but you know one of those books in particular I've just I've reread maybe 20 32 it's like I read it a chapter out of it every single morning before I practice and it's been a huge huge help to me not just in work in everything and I think that's that's the type of inspiration it's a type of stuff that we try and tell the team to kind of look at so it's not so traditional but it's for us I think is it's really important I just seen the so often like we we tend to separate our work life and our and our personal life when we think okay what do we need to read for work and what do we need to read like I don't know how you guys but I the mind that I have at home I take into work and the mind that I have at work I take home in the evening you know and mine is not separate you know and the work we do on it and then we when we train our mind you know we do it at home we're also kind of impacting our mind at work and vice versa so I think is whatever kind of helped you find that sense of of calm and clarity and contentment and for us is it's those kind of books I mean I guess you guys can see very clearly that these guys really live sort of what they teach and I think as an investor myself as I look at startups and founders this is the trade I'm looking for this is what you can't this is the story you can't fake right like these guys are deep in it it comes from really deep inside it's very clear I mean you can see it very clearly up here I was just amazing to see one more question before we jump into the audience you've been doing this for six years a lot of people would say you've made it I guess you could argue whether that's true or not but as we know as businesses grow the intensity in general increases the challenges may change but it's fairly challenging you work very long hours and we were having dinner last night talking about this like do you ever take a break for yourself and if you do how how do you relax how do you reward yourself for quote unquote success if you want to call it that um well surfing has been thinking that as as going to save me on it on a number of occasions and we take regular surf trips together in fact when we're kind of struggling with a big problem at work we often go away and kind of do retreat based around surfing so that that has been a huge thing for me and just just generally getting out in nature and getting away from the normal routine that you find yourself in I find kind of frees something up this it's pretty simple I lead a pretty boring life is the truth but it kind of works that's the simple things that I add around my work that kind of make it manageable I think super cool it's great that you share and your outside life you share very similar interests so there is a nice merging if you want to call it or the for sure I get to just to be clear I now we have a child I get to do a little less surfing these days who these surf trips do exist but they're not as frequent my wife used to be very enthusiastic about me going away now a little less oh so yeah I totally understand I know where we are maybe out of time but I wanted to I know you guys probably have a lot of questions in the audience is very dark I'm not sure how we want to run this but I want to have some questions out there over this way guys Andy rich saying so I'll be brief hopefully I backstage I can tell you I came out here from Orlando Florida tell you thank you one year ago my father had a bypass surgery on his heart and his life was at risk he very much like me was always getting upset very tense very stressful of course as a surgeon and the first time in our lives we did a father-son goal and the last 125 days we've been meditating together across the country through your app and it saved my father's life and my life as well and I wanted to just personally thank you and hopefully shake your hand to say thank you for changing my life one one quick note - what Andy Dunn said about self-awareness it's very important and yeah I I forget what you say every day but I never forget the way you guys make me feel the way I feel then today when I do your practice so thank you somebody's sharing thank thank you good afternoon rich and Andy my name is a beer you know the cultures of mindfulness and cultures of Commerce can be at odds with each other at times I was wondering if you had any experience you can share where you really helped define a culture at headspace that honors both of these Heritage's which you've integrated what is a few things I think one it's it's about how can we encourage practice without forcing practice I think that's the key to getting that kind of cultural bit right internally so 10 o'clock every morning you know kind of large group space we do it at 8:10 we do it together again at 3 o'clock in the afternoon we do that and then we've got these meditation pods that we've got there that anyone can use any time in during the day and it's all optional and I think that helps to set a kind of culture like if we can get people kind of taking time out and actually practicing the content I think it has a huge impact in how people are in their day and and how they kind of respond to one another I think at the same time our mission is to improve the health and happening to the world which is big and I'm not sure it will ever be finished which is kind of part the reason why we like it but it's also means that that's going to take resources and we need to be able to build a successful business so we can attract the best talent and I think I think it's I to be honest with you something that we kind of it's a really it's a point of tension that we that we're constantly kind of working at and I'm not sure that we've got it perfect would you say absolutely I think one of the the biggest things for us that we landed on probably few years ago we actually started out kind of thinking it's going to be a charity and we kind of worked at how to make it a little more quick-moving than a charity but we started a study something called get some give some couple of years ago which means that we we were able to balance that kind of commercial with also that the culture of mindfulness actually making it more available to other so every time someone buys a subscription we're able to to give one away to someone who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford it or have access to it so it's but as rich that it's a constant balance trying to find that sweet spot I think hi I'm Chris and first I really wanted to say thanks to you and your team because after hundreds of mindfulness sessions through headspace it's helped me in my mental health as well as inspired the product I'm trying to build and one thing I see though is I recommend it to a lot of hustlers you know oh you're feeling kind of stressed well you definitely you got a lot on your mind you could use some headspace but I still see a lot of people who have a really hard time especially with the hustler mindset of integrating mindfulness into their daily practice so have you found any things that could help all of us you know do that a little better sure yeah it's one thanks for using headspace and I'm really happy it's had that impact for you I in terms of integrating into your everyday life I like building any routine our same time same place is really helpful if you can do the first thing in the morning before the day's really got up and running if you can do it even before you check your emails and know it's a big ask but if you can it's ten minutes I think that will make a make a massive difference try tying it to something else so it's called coupling and it's when you you might have a shower and then meditate or you have a cup of tea and then meditate or breakfast to meditate so something that you already do on a daily basis you just simply add meditation to it and because it's already part of your routine you're that much more likely to do it I think the biggest kind of often for many people you know it is a time thing and I don't have an extra 10 15 minutes to spare in a day I'm very busy and maybe it feels as though that's wasted times those unproductive time as though you're not doing something valuable towards achieving your goal but the truth is actually the other way around as a result of taking that time out you will be clearer you will be more focused you will be more productive you'll probably achieve way more in the day than you otherwise would have done yeah thanks so much no worries all the time we have thank you guys so much a thank you

Le Tote is a subscription-based fashion company for women who want to beef up their wardrobe without breaking the bank. It's kind of like Netflix for fashion, back when Netflix was shipping DVDs. 

Here's how it works: Users sign up, tell their assigned stylist what they like to wear, and then are sent a box (tote) full of clothes. Wear what you like and send the items back when you’re done. You can do this an unlimited number of times each month. 

The company has raised $27.5 million since launching in 2012, grew 500% year over year, and will be shipping over $100 million worth of garmets in 2016. But they had to start somewhere. 

In this presentation, Le Tote co-founder Brett Northart explains how he went from the concept of Le Tote to the actual product. He starts with a detailed explanation of how he discovered product market fit. He also discusses how to find and play to your strengths, why the first few iterations should suck, the value of talking to your early customers, and how to iterate... and iterate and iterate.

the idea phase that is how you go from the idea phase to actually building out the first version of your product and if you're not familiar with with tote we've been dubbed the Netflix for fashion so we provide unlimited access to our closet of women's apparel and accessories for a fixed price each month and the business is going really well we've been growing like crazy whoa we've been growing like crazy we've got over 200 employees today split between two locations and we've raised it over 30 million dollars from top tier VCS like Google Ventures andreessen horowitz and Y Combinator so we're gonna talk about getting started today and the only thing that really matters when you're starting your business is getting to products market fit this is gonna be interesting so product market fit is basically putting something out there that really strikes a nerve with consumers something that people are really excited about and for us what that meant or how we got started getting towards product market fit was my co-founders wife was pregnant and she realized that buying maternity clothes is insane you only use them for four or five months and then you never see them again and at the same time my wife was in a clothing swap group in the city and she was constantly looking for more variety in her closet and we were all out to dinner one night we got to talking and realized that both of these women were doing the exact same thing to get access to variety and we thought to ourselves would it be interesting if you took this online and gave people unlimited access to a closet that they could all use so we started talking to more people over the coming weeks and the idea started seeming better and better but the big question that we had to ask ourselves was are we willing to quit our cushy finance jobs and go all-in on this idea well needless to say a couple weeks later we quit our jobs and well and we took over the kids playroom so this is our very first office we've got a sweet basketball hoop here we had a fold-out couch which was helpful for late nights and we put up a white board and we poured our collective savings into the business and started buying clothing and accessories and I can't tell you guys how many times I got a fraud alert phone call from Wells Fargo saying hey Bret did you just buy seven thousand dollars worth of women's dresses and frighteningly the answer was yes every single time but we didn't really care because in the early days you're just trying to figure out if people want what you're putting out into the world so we were trying to answer fundamental questions about our business like how many times can you send out a dress before it starts getting worn out and how much does it cost to ship these items all over the country and even something as simple as do people want unlimited fashion on a rental model so another piece of advice I have early on is you've got to have someone by your side to help out so for me I had a co-founder but it was a lot more than that you've got to have someone in the trenches you can bounce ideas off of someone who's there to pick you up when you're feeling unmotivated and it wasn't just my co-founder it was a family affair for us from day one so this is actually a picture of my co-founders wife and his newborn daughter and they were helping us unbag one of our first inventory buys and it didn't stop there so we also convinced a good friend of ours who was a buyer out in New York City to pack up her life fly to San Francisco sleep on one of our couches for six months and help us get this crazy idea off the ground and my co-founders parents even got involved so they came to visit from India and they thought they were gonna have a relaxing three months visit and gets to the family well we convinced them to come to the office every single day and do administrative tasks around the office this is very serious by the way they totally made all of these boxes so I stressed this point because it really critical early on to get people to help you out to bring your product to life is this really hard and it's an uphill battle and you hear no all the time so you need that support system there and just know that things will break in the early days so you're optimizing for speed over perfection and these are actually racks that I built myself so as you can tell I'm a really shitty handyman but the good news is we had enough demand for our product that we were actually breaking the infrastructure that we were built albeit it was very bad infrastructure but we did it anyways so well and just know that that being bad is okay in the early days because it's the first step to building something amazing and my favorite quote on this comes from the legendary investor and founder of LinkedIn Reid Hoffman and he said that if you're not embarrassed by the first version of your product you've launched too late and I love this because it really embodies the idea that done is better than perfect so let me show you guys what embarrassing looked like for us when we launched the first version of our product so we could have gone out and hired an engineering team and built out this robust product of all the features that we thought people wanted but instead we hired an outsource development team in India and we had them slap together a landing page for us and this is hideous it's this black background with like 19 different fonts and there's a couple shades of blue that are clashing with each other it really it makes me cringe looking at this today but we had to get something out into the world to see if people even cared what we were doing and we took a lot of solace in the fact that no one knows who you are when you're launching and so there's not that many people that you can piss off or offend in the early days you just want to get it out there hear what people have to say and you can always make it better but don't be wrapped up in this idea that it needs to be perfect before it gets out the door because you don't even know what perfect is yet so this is the version that we ended up launching and this is actually not where we are today this was reformatted this was the very first version that we launched back in the day and all you could really do on this site is login you could enter your email address create a password you could log in to see how many people that you would referred or you could refer your friends through Facebook and we also had this referral page and we went out and we got a couple thousand tote bags printed and we decided we were gonna send these bags to anyone that could get three of their friends to refer or get three of their friends to come and enter their email address on our website and this is the type of stuff that's very inexpensive to you but it goes a long way with customers and potential customers so with this very simple landing page on this referral tool behind it we were able to gather over 25,000 email addresses in the first few months that we could market to and this gave us more customers than we could handle for over a year so geez so we were two guys starting women's fashion company we worked in finance before we didn't have a background in merchandising or operations but we did know Excel and PowerPoint like the back of our hand and so instead of trying to go out and like build all these things we didn't know how to do and use tools that we didn't know how to work we built everything in Excel and PowerPoint so this is one of the very first design sessions we did we used to mock everything up in PowerPoint and we'd send it to our offshore development team and this is not ideal is actually a horrible way to do it but it got things done and it got our first product out the door so all the customers could do at the time was go on the website and fill out a quick style profile and it had things like their age their style preferences their measurements their location so we used to download these in Excel make each tab a customers name and put them into this master excel workbook now at the end of this we had like thousands of tabs in this workbook and it took like 15 minutes to open this thing but it got us where we needed to go and so over time it's actually morphed into we started tracking every single item that we sent customers we would manually enter this stuff and then we get feedback in the customer service inbox and we put that off to the side and if it sounds really that's because it was we even tracked it we even tracked every single shipment that went out to customers so this spreadsheet also had like thousands of rows by the end and this is all to say that you can do a lot with a little in the early days so just think about what you can do well and go out and build with those tools and that skill set the next the next important thing is that you've got to get out and actually talk to your customers so once you get your product out into the world you have to hear what people think so I always encourage people to actually go meet people collect phone numbers collect email addresses give them a phone call my co-founder and I were the customer service for our business for the first 18 months or so and just being in the flow every day talking to customers hearing what they had to say was incredibly helpful and it gave us a lot of insights into how to make the service better you also have to charge people money a lot of people are willing to or tell you what they're willing to pay for something or they tell you oh yeah I would use it this way or that way but until their parting with their hard-earned cash no one's gonna give you an unbiased opinion so you've got to charge for whatever you're putting out there and the last thing is you've got to question all of your assumptions you have so for us when we started the business we thought our demographic was gonna be significantly younger turns out it's actually a working professional woman we thought that our customers were gonna really like to get a curated mystery box every time and our customers actually want a lot more control over the experience and we also figured that because people were signing up for a rental service they wouldn't actually want to buy anything and we were completely wrong on that luckily because purchase is now a huge part of our revenue so once you put your product out there it built something and you've talked to your customers you've got to you've got to iterate and this is the most important piece so you've got to take all that feedback and build meaningful improvements into your product based on what your customers tell you and I think we've been able to do that so I want to give you guys a quick glimpse into where we are today luckily I no longer sit and fill out spreadsheets all day and I'm in charge of design which is great for everyone we've got a massive distribution center out in the Central Valley these are racks that I didn't build myself which is why they're holding up so well we've built our own inventory management system from scratch we have an amazing in-house development team data scientists we built our own warehouse management system as well it's all cloud-based we send out thousands of items daily moving us closer to our mission of making fashion accessible for everyone every day so again I'm Brett oh geez I'm Brett I'm the founder of the tote thank you guys so much I'm also horrible at working a little clicker apparently apologize hi Brett thanks so much for talking to us just had a quick question about I'm getting your products out quickly do you think that gets in the way of building a strong brand like if it's a crappy product then it might like get in the way of building a strong brand yeah so it really depends what kind of product you're launching if if you if you just created that $700 juicer machine you have to make sure your product is dialed in from day one because you only get one shot at really putting a huge consumer product like that out into the market and it's really expensive to go and get something like that prototype and built out and you can't just iterate I think a lot of this is in the context of software but for us it was kind of a mix of software and physical goods and so we just wanted to see what people thought and if there was demand now it really it's very specific to whatever product you're building I think hi Brett I'm Roxy hey hi so I have a very similar model but the problem that I'm having is to go to market strategy so can you explain a little bit how you figure that out when you first started because I'm kind of in the same position sure yeah so we we just talked to anyone that would listen to us really we we started asking a lot of people if they would be interested in a service like this what they thought of it we actually just bought a bunch of clothing and sent it to friends and colleagues like anyone that would take a box and we got feedback from them before we went out to the market and then we started we sort of buying some Google Adwords just to drive people to our landing page and we wanted to figure out what price point people would be willing to pay so we put them at prices in the ads and we drove them to a landing page we also put a checkout page up with varying configurations of the box so today we send three garments and two accessories and we didn't just pick this out of thin air we arrived at that after like iterating on this quite a bit so there was a lot that went into figuring it out and then that landing page and the referral thing that I showed helped us get a ton of email addresses early on we just gave away like some freebies and because it was a gated experience we were in like a private beta we used exclusivity to our advantage and we didn't we said you have to refer a certain number of people to actually get early access to the site so we use exclusivity as a way to also like juice our referrals how many people do you think you actually reached before you decided to go all-in you mean like how many people did we talk to yes yeah hundred everybody talked to like any any women that we could find they would listen to two guys and like a coffee shop or you know the streets of San Francisco people that were like crazy dudes walking around and just talking people but amazing yeah you have to do we have to do so I don't know hundreds thousands out of those yeah but don't overthink it too much I think a lot of people like again like you have to charge money for your product early on because until you're charging a lot of people like oh I love that idea I hate that idea but until you put it out there it's hard to know thank you thank you Brad that's all the time we have things cool cheers guys thanks

Within a matter of days, Morrill had a prototype ready and had already started acquiring users. Now Mattermark is seeing 31% monthly growth with a team of less than 50 full time employees. 

In this presentation, Danielle explains the process she went through to hone in on her idea, create the first prototype of the product, and acquire early users.

awesome so happy to be here I'm going to be telling you a little bit about starting matter mark my company and so let's jump right in about ten minutes I'm Danielle Morrill on Twitter so tweet to me if I don't tell you a story that you want to hear and we'll keep going on Twitter afterwards so just to jump right in so how did I get to matter mark so you know I was really excited to give this talk because they were like tell your life story so you know 1985 just kidding all right so I did a bunch of things before and the biggest thing that I did that led me to build mater mark was I actually dropped out of Community College pretty early on and started working in a shipping company shipping companies are super interesting I know there's some founders who've been here talking about logistics today so when you work as shipping you see all this interesting data so we're going to come back the data in a little bit ended up getting into the startups teeing up in Seattle publishing some stuff working on a start-up there that ended up getting acquired and then I moved to the Bay Area right after the economy crashed in 2009 to work for Twilio when it was just three founders and little me as a marketing contractor ended up being the first employee there did that for about three and a half years and then started a company called referral II that got into Y Combinator to do social referrals for products so kind of like affiliate marketing for everyone turned out to be a really crappy business 11 months in negative gross margins which we now know from the startup press or bad thing restarted the company entirely as a matter mark and that's what I'm going to tell you about today so through Y Combinator we're shutting down refer lee so of course I went to Paul Graham and I wanted some advice instead you know I'm really burned out this business is not working and right now I'm also kind of just disillusioned about Silicon Valley and I really of all the things that I dislike you know they say find that thing that drives you crazy in that world the problem that you want to solve really hate TechCrunch yeah I've written this before don't worry it's not news they know and so I really hate it because it doesn't cover the startup so my friends are working on and it doesn't really feel like I'm connected to it it feels like it's like Google Apple Microsoft Nokia Yahoo whatever it's like well you know most of my friends are building startups that are like three people in an apartment so pg was like well if you want to kill TechCrunch then do that so really like that's probably not gonna be a very good business so could it be a good business could it have traction I honestly didn't worry about that at first I was like I just want to do something I like because I'm really worried I'm gonna get jaded and I'm gonna get out of this town and I'm never going to come back so I decided okay over 30 days what I'm going to do is I'm going to write a blog post every day I can I live like this can I actually publish every day do I have any right to say anything negative about these journalists turns out it's really hard really hard to publish every day not only that but I'm not a journalist or wasn't then I'm not sure what I am but we had a couple posts that really took off we wrote a post about zombie startups we wrote including ourselves we wrote a post about zombie VCS where we took a bunch of data from crunch base and tried to show which VCS were talking a big game but not actually actively investing in startups and pissed off everybody in the industry it was awesome so the first lesson there was if you piss off everybody you might have something because people don't get pissed off about a lot of things they're usually just ambivalent so that was very interesting and it validated that we could build an audience you know TechCrunch has an audience we could build an audience we liked data because we didn't have any leads we didn't have any relationships we didn't have any sources and no PR people were sending us any pitches so some of the posts that were successful gave us a sense of the type of stuff that might work and we got this really encouraging email so at one point we indexed or we listed all the companies in the andreessen horowitz portfolio and we rank them based on some growth metrics we were tracking and I got this email from Marc Andreessen who I'd never met and it was like yeah what that guy said holy we should be doing this ourselves that's what he said with the smiley face is copy-pasted sorry I swear and I thought I was like okay well holy why aren't they doing this right like it must be there must be some reason and it turns out it's hard it's time-consuming there's a lot of stuff to do at a VC firm we knew nothing about that at the time we need nothing about venture capital people think oh well they were always VC insiders that's why they started this business no definitely not insiders so we published some of our research and the data at the bottom of our blog posts so people started emailing us saying can we get more of those spreadsheets and then they would have one for a while and they would say can we get an update we were like you know sure why not here's the update and at some point there's just so many spreadsheets and so many updates that my husband my CTO was like we should probably you know like build software for this maybe like you know make it simple to log in so finding and analyzing data is hard that's what you realize so let's build this little database so turns out you can take a my sequel database you can shove it into a really stupid simple JavaScript library and you have a really ugly ass database that people can log into and you don't have to worry about you know a sign-in system just some litte T access and everybody's logging into the same damn thing and that's what we had it's really simple and for those of you don't know what some of that stuff is it doesn't matter because it was so simple that I could set it up without even necessarily being very good at writing code so now we have these spreadsheets you have these lists we had about 20,000 startups we were tracking and you guys can probably imagine there's way more than 20,000 companies out there and it's me my husband Kevin our CTO and my best friend Andy living in this tiny apartment in San Francisco and Andy's the data monkey literally I would come up with a post idea and I'd be like okay you've got 48 hours to get all the data will I write the other post and then Andy would go and get all the data and I write the post and do a document how I did it and then Kevin would write the software so that he never had to do it again and then we just did that over and over and over again people thought we had magic but we didn't have magic yet and then something really crazy happened and this is definitely where we got lucky so Lina Rao who I believe now writes at fortune was writing for TechCrunch at the time and TechCrunch wrote a trend piece about quantitative venture capital this is in the summer of 2013 and at the very end of the post she said maybe some smart startup will come along and solve this problem so the post goes out on a Friday I read this post I'm in Palo Alto I think trying to sell to someone and I pull over and I call up my co-founders I'm like oh my god we have to jump on this now she just told the whole valley to build this and we're building it how like how do I get her phone number so you know imagine tapping around on Facebook and Twitter and whatever and call her and say okay we're building this thing let me show you what we made we want to launch on Monday and we all we had was that thing we showed you before that little ugly spreadsheet in yellow with a little like single user login and we had no marketing page we had no login system we had no user system nothing she's a great I'd love to launch you exclusively on Monday so we were like okay cool we were moving into a new apartment that weekend we were all sick so we built the rest of the product so when we launched and it was free some people could sign up these were leads also oh I never really done B to be before or SAS so we were like Oh weeds what's that so we're on TechCrunch it's amazing you know back by any and Andreessen by the way I think Andreessen wrote us a $50,000 check when our bank account was at its lowest so it doesn't matter it's a really nice headline we got this thing out there and we had some early customers so that was how we built the prototype how do we get the early customers well honestly we just contacted every single venture capital firm NEA was already an investor so that was really helpful they offered us an enterprise contract right out of the gate and then Albert Vanguard and Square Ventures is a data nerd he loves consuming api's gave him access he wrote an amazing blog post um and these are surprises we just wake up and and there's this blog post from him talking about how every VC of the future is going to need to use data and we're just like not really sure this is all really happening and the funniest thing was we launched with this tagline the matter mark was like a bloomberg for startups and Bloomberg actually launched a venture capital fund the same day so that was weird so we obviously needed to connect with them and then we ended up doing a research project with them I'll never forget Roy telling me hey you should really take our $50,000 because it's the best capital you'll ever take it's not diluted and I was like oh maybe I could get someone else to give me $50,000 that's not diluted I mean we didn't know anything about b2b we had been making like $1 37 at a time on affiliate marketing for the past two years so it was it was a lot better so then we realized we've got to go and sell all the VCS we've got to do it as fast as possible we've got to go down Sand Hill Road and over the next three weeks we just tried to meet with everyone we could it's funny it was actually easier to get meetings for selling them something than pitching them very much I guess not very many people are trying to sell things to VC's I don't know but it was really weird it's like suddenly I'm in these boardrooms that I could never get into before you know Sequoia and Google Ventures and I'm like okay this is I'm on the other side what side am I on I don't really know and we're learning how venture capital works so literally sit me down with an associate and tell me what's hard about your job why are you wasting time you've got an MBA from Harvard you probably don't need to be a data monkey and setting them free from that so we had all this validation and we decided we better start charging money for this also we're going to be broke because we're all living in an apartment together and we only had like $150,000 of the million we'd raised left which was only gonna last us like six or seven more months so we launched matter mark Pro for $499 a month and the way that happened is Albert from USD who I mentioned before basically I was on the phone doing like a discovery call making sure things were going well and he said I feel kind of guilty you're not charging me I was like okay so should I charge you it's like yeah how much is it okay um I'm thinking to myself my expense reporting policy in my last job was oh yeah $4.99 because $500 is where you have to get approval um that was the logic so really good way to price your product so he was like great where do I put my credit card um let me call you back this is also he's on the East Coast so it's like 8:30 in the morning I run over to Kevin wake him up you got to build a stripe form right now what ah what get up get up they want to give us money oh can it wait no I can't wait you're kidding me like I can't wait besides stripe is amazing so we had 25 minutes later because he's awesome we had a stripe form up and I call him back sorry I didn't know the URL here's the page totally have it together and then they paid us like so that was the beginning of the addiction to SAS so then we had money in the bank we got twelve paying customers something close to that $4.99 times whatever in the first month and three years later where it were actually at three point five million and air are now so we make about just shy of three hundred thousand dollars a month so that's what happened and it was a little bit crazy and it's so crazy in fact because we were going a lot bigger with Matt or mark today than before we don't just sell the VCS anymore now we realize sales teams have the exact same problem VC's do so now we're in the process of figuring out how to track every company in the world which is going to be hopefully another set of crazy stories that I'll get to come back and tell you the next conference so I'm out of time and I'd love to answer to questions but thank you for hearing the beginning of my life story I think we have time for two questions really good job with the clicker by the way kill it thank you any questions yeah thank you follow me on Twitter yeah so the question is are we pivoting away from venture capital kind of how do we see the balance of serving the VC customers and news aggregation so news aggregation is awesome so we have a newsletter called the matter mark daily it goes out every day to about a hundred thousand people highly recommend you subscribe on our website and it tries to aggregate the best of the content that comes from the VCS and the best of the content that comes from start-up operators and really importantly we really look for those editorial column style pieces where you're telling your own experience because that's what I wanted and ideally in a dream world I'd write all those stories so I think we'll continue to do that primarily because it comes from a place of passion and it's how we build our community we now do crawl the majority of the internet for news and so we do our technology pulls facts out of news and organizes them into a database so that turns out to be really valuable for lots of purposes but over the long term our business will probably become less focused on venture capital just because it's only a you know maybe 20 to 50 million dollar a year revenue business if we get every single drop of it whereas if you solve the problems for sales people it's a much bigger market so I think I don't like to think of it as a pivot we still love those initial customers it's just a realization that to really be as big of business as we want to be we've got to keep expanding hey hey Danielle my name is Brian I'm curious what some of the non-intuitive signals you found where they indicate that a start-up is on to something non-intuitive well now I feel like they're obvious but there probably weren't intuitive so I think early employee count is is very important um kind of net employee count so you're turning people over they're leaving and coming but is the graph ultimately up in to the right and how fast is that growing now I hesitate to say it's not an intuitive because when I say it you're probably like well duh like you don't hire more people to into your startup until things feel like they're going well but it turns out that's a really hard thing to track so it has been a really valuable data point that we track really well I think I have time for one more another I don't have a question I just want to say you are a total badass Thanks total badass and okay so I was actually the sponsor t-shirts matter but Reid Hoffman who I used to work with he was my manager he's got this really famous phrase if you're not embarrassed by your first product watch then you've launched too late why I watch the way I supposed to have a table okay i paper table i can get my together anyways on bear anyways for every single speaker everyone will get a free t-shirt because i have a database that's hustle and then everyone gets 10% off once i get my off in front so there's that oh and then okay I'm an investor I'm an angel investor in hustle con media and I sent an email to 100 people I didn't BCC him including Sarah Lacy and she replied back that it was inconsiderate and then sampark basically my what's your business good luck thank you very much - thank you everyone all right

thank you for the introduction Sam I'm excited to be here this is like I feel like I'm wrapped in a in a warm blanket of musical history this is just fantastic um so my name is David BL I am the co-founder and CEO of a company called Bloom that um and basically Bloom that is the best way to send flowers it's pretty simple um we make it incredibly easy to make you look incredibly good so uh we basically approached this by saying like let's improve the customer experience let's deliver an awesome product um and let's build a brand that makes flowers relevant and fun and engaging and being thoughtful is like something you can think about 365 days a year um the topic of today's presentation is doing more with less um and scaling with simplicity um if there's one thing that I want you all to sort of take away from today's conversation um it's sort of like just this one thing um and that is that you are the guardians of Simplicity within your organization and it is a whole hell of a lot easier to add complexities in than it is to take them out so you have to be incredibly Vigilant to say like uh uhuh no complexities into this flow um and so I just want you to take away that one thing from this talk so I'm a simple guy Bloom that started as a simple concept um with a simple question if sending flowers was as simple as sending a text message would you send more often um and so we sort of started a company with this question and our customers answered and uh the answer was resoundingly yes so we basically started Bloom that as a bigger broader gifting idea and narrowed it down to flowers because we identify that there was this massive Gap in the experience of sending flowers and I'm sure that a lot of you in the audience can relate to this you've used 1800 Flowers you've used FTD you know that feeling when you're like oh I've got an obligation coming up I got to use something to send something thoughtful um you don't know what if what you're sending is going to look like the picture and just generally it's a piss poor experience so we said let's solve this we can do better than this so basically the story of Bloom that goes like this um I moved to San Francisco maybe four years ago or so um I bought a bunch of tulips from Whole Foods um I threw up a Shopify website and I bought $100 in Facebook ads around Valentine's Day and decided you know Bloom that should be a thing let's start this off of my patio um we were able to turn that traction into enough to get accepted into y combinator we're able to turn that traction into enough to re to raise a seed seed round we're parlayed that into raising a series a and now we're delivering Nationwide and so you see the sort of the the progress there is from back patio to Nationwide in three years so not too bad so things are going very well today um as Sam said I've mentioned we're delivering Nationwide we do same day delivery in the Bay Area and Manhattan um a couple fun fact up here we're attacking an $8 billion industry and we're growing it because there are tons of use cases to be thoughtful it's just that the services provided as sort of the vehicle for that thoughtfulness are pretty shitty um our team is about 45 people and then you'll see up here there's there's an icon there that says 53 proposals um there are two things I want to talk to you about with that is that one people trust you enough to say will you marry me with your service you know that you're doing something right um and then second uh I'm actually not even supposed to be here today my co-founder Matt accepted the speaking gig um and then he forgot that he's getting married tomorrow so uh that uh you know you're stuck with me so you know let's deal with it and move on so you know things are going really well today but that wasn't always the case in fact if we rewind even nine months ago um we were staring into the abyss um so two years two plus years into you know founding a company you're standing in my shoes you started very simple and you wind up fast forward you're burning over a half a million dollars a month you've got four months of cash sort of left in the bank what do you do how did we get here and sort of the the topic of or the top line of of this slide is sort of self-explanatory but expansion is really hard um you know we started simple uh 90minut delivery within San Francisco 7x7 then we expanded 90-minute delivery over to the East Bay then down to the South Bay then 90-minute delivery in Los Angeles and not just part of Los Angeles we did all of Los Angeles and you know what Los Angeles is like at 5:00 rush hour it's a tough thing um and then we expanded to Manhattan 90-minute delivery and before we knew it this simple concept had morphed its way into this Beast that you know the assumptions that we had made how this is going to work and how the unit economics played out um they were the realities were completely different once we allowed this thing to sort of snowball into this massive complex operation and then the other thing that we we found is that we were eventually running three companies you know we're fairly well capitalized but we were running a delivery company so we had a delivery app managing a delivery Fleet we were a marketing and Merchandising company and we were a flower building and manufacturing company and at that point like you know we're duding what are the things that we do really well I'm probably not going to beat FedEx and Uber and whoever else is experts in getting things delivered so why would I spend you know my precious seed Capital doing something that is not my core competency so we were sitting in a situation where it's like really questioning our survival is this a feasible business can we get this done we know that we set out to um really accomplish this objective of like we want to make sending flowers better um but is this something that we can scale and can we streamline our operations to make the gross margin side of things the contribution side of things um I guess the equivalent to the user experience side of things so we had to sort of uh I guess I call it a coming to Jesus moment but we basically looked into the abyss and said what do we got to do to turn this into a business that makes sense again um and what that involved was getting back to the basics so the board deck after saying you know hey guess what guys board of directors uh we're going to be out of business in four months if we don't do something said don't worry we've got a plan um basically the plan was we got to fix our gross margins we've got to streamline our operations uh we've got to retain our Topline revenue and we've got to do this in a really fast turnaround time so the way that we approach this first is we sort of evaluated how can we do this without disrupting the user experiences that was sort of Paramount in what we set out to accomplish to begin with and so we evaluated where were we over optimizing for Speed or things that maybe were not absolutely necessary from a customer standpoint in order to fulfill this promise that we had of an amazing flower delivery experience so we looked at as an example give an anecdote South Bay we were delivering in 1 hour Windows it was costing us a fortune to cover that area and deliver in 1 hour windows we looked at well what if we pushed it to 2 hours can we do that what's the what's the impacting user experience well making a small change like that reduced our delivery costs by over 25% uh we also looked at Los Angeles and said yo we think this is going to be a phenomenal Market but not right now we don't have the resources to spread ourselves that thin so we closed that market um and these are things that I would say that we had to break down in order to regroup and build back up um the other thing that we had to do was we evaluated our pricing structure so again I said that as we expanded geographies uh we lost track of our gross margins and sort of by the end of it clearly we were we were not making money on any of our deliveries net um so basically uh we we decided hey I know we've been fighting this but we got to add delivery fee and you know that's something that we've been fighting the whole time but it's really important how you go about it if you're talking to your customers you know you know you've got to break some hard news and your initial instinct is to sort of make the change and hope no one notices but that is the worst thing you could possibly do thanks thankfully um we didn't do that so we wrote a letter to our customers saying hey you know what our priority is providing you an exceptional customer experience to be as transparent as possible we've tried to avoid including delivery prices or delivery fees into the price of of your Bloom that deliveries but it's not feasible any longer we're committed to providing an exceptional experience and we've got a charge to do to do that so I think I'm going a little bit long and I've got a hair trigger uh basically wanted to become default alive um and I think through the steps of what we did we landed in that place and how well did it work 3 months later we landed ourselves in a position where we took ourselves from a half a million a month to 15,000 a month in burn and that is something that I think you'll see is very relevant to startups in today's environment the steroid era of startups is over um and I'll tell you that like you know this is not something I'd wish upon my worst enemy however there's a silver lining our team is so much better as a result of going through these changes and the filter that has been sort of ingrained in the DNA of our company now is gross margins matter and that's something that I think if especially if you're delivering things you're delivering offline and you're a revenue generating business gross margins matter even in the beginning so I'm going to sort of Blaze through the key learnings here start narrow start focused um do a couple things really well you can always add verticals beyond that don't mask things that don't work you raise Venture Capital dollars you're expected to experiment some of those experiments are going to fail but don't cover up mechanical problems within your business face them headon uh talk to your customers we know this is an iterative process but it's also how you talk to your customers be human be transparent they're going to appreciate it um if we look at the evolving role of a Founder preed stage to seed stage to A to B Your Role is going to evolve if you're self-aware enough to know when you are where you are um it's going to be a lot easier to make those transitions um and I have clear filters here but I want to skip to the one that I I I said in the very beginning you are the guardians of Simplicity within your organization no one else is going to be D mutambu up there going so that is what you need to do is be aware that there's a compounding impact of complexities and especially as you scale you're going to find that you look back and you go how did I get here you want to avoid that you are the Guardians so what's next for Bloom we're going to continue to launch same day cities next time it's going to be smarter um our goal here is that we are changing consumer Behavior around sending flowers um so we want Bloom that to be a verb so when someone thinks about um you know hey it's so and so's birthday tomorrow we want the response to be oh you should send a bloom that um we want to be synonymous with thoughtfulness so we're delivering blooms across the country I think we're doing it better than it's ever been done before if you guys need help being thoughtful we're the company for you um follow us on Instagram uh we I think have a world-class Instagram feed um go to bloomnet.com or download the iOS app thank you so much for uh being here today we're going to have a fantastic event um thank you and I think what's next is I think we've got soilent potentially right so maybe some this is Dsquared we haven't his name is David so it's David and David don't get confused um going to pass this over to Sam thank you guys have a great [Applause] day

Soylent is a meal replacement beverage with all the nutritional requirements of a healthy, well-balanced meal for an adult. The creator, Rob Rhinehart, first developed Soylent as a way to cut down on food prep and cleanup time, and to increase productivity. The result is Soylent, which is available as a powder or liquid and has developed a cult-like following. Soylent has made over $100m in revenue, and has fewer than 50 full-time employees. In this video, co-founder Dave Renteln explains how he helped scale the business and triple revenue by making decisions that went against normal business conventions.

so I'm David and I'm a co-founder and the chief marketing officer of Soylent and what I want to talk to you about today is how sticking to your principles and embracing the weird aspects of your business can ultimately generate interest in the form of press community and ultimately sales so if for those of you who aren't familiar with Soylent as Sam mentioned it is something that can sometimes be hard to describe what we do is we make engineered staple foods so those products that we make currently are powder and a ready to drink meal in a bottle and so the breakdown of they're ready to drink for instance which we're actually serving out here today is 400 calories and that's 20% of everything that you need in a day that's carbs fat protein fiber vitamins minerals everything and so that is four so five bottles of RTD would equal a 2,000 calorie perfect diet according to the Institute of Medicine and the FDA and so a lot of people consume Soylent for breakfast for lunch dinner I consumer for breakfast and lunch on the weekdays I'm about sort of a 50% Soylent diet the percentage of Soylent that someone consumes in their diet is is often sort of a subject of discussion and so we'll get to that a little bit so how do we get started that's me a couple years ago when I didn't know any better essentially I moved into a hacker house with a couple guys in Sunnyvale California in 2012 and we were looking around and trying to figure out sort of how we could cut our costs our rent was as cheap as it could possibly be the house was falling apart at the seams we had to wash our dishes with the hose the the only good thing about the house actually was it had a pretty decently sized pool in the backyard and so we thought okay well this will be nice we can invite people over we can have some pool parties you know maybe barbecue the the snag there was that the pool was covered in a thick layer of green algae and try as we might we could not get rid of it we would pour chlorine it would evaporate the algae would come back and so that was pretty frustrating but more distressing than that was the fact that we were essentially starving especially from a malnutrition standpoint so we would go to Costco and we get corndogs ramen frozen pizzas as you can see there and we just were not feeling too good you know we'd we'd go and we'd spend hundreds of dollars at Costco and just go through all of that food in just a week and you know we'd be left feeling pretty sick and so quite a few times you know we'd be sort of lamenting our misfortune and sitting in our backyard eating a frozen Costco corndog looking at the green pool thinking why can't we kill this [ __ ] but you know more you know again more important than the pool was we were hungry and so we needed a hero enter Rob Reinhart our CEO he saw our problem and he went about devising a very ingenious solution which was a scientifically engineered powdered food right and as you can see that's Rob looking very svelte with one of the original glasses of Soylent that he made and next room you can see some of the original ingredients the different powders that we mixed together to create that original recipe and of course a scale that would be out of place anywhere except for a chemistry lab or a drug den so what we did is Rob lived on that original recipe for 30 days and that generated a ton of interest and so what happened was we received an outpouring of requests over 30,000 people wanted to repeat the experiment where Rob lived entirely on Soylent for 30 days and they they offered to give their blood and and do it under the supervision of a physician the same way that Rob did and so we thought to ourselves if 30,000 people are willing to give you their blood you probably have a business and so what we did is we looked around and realized to produce Soylent it's scale we needed to be able to afford a large scale manufacturing contract and so to put the money together necessary to reach that scale we turned to crowdfunding and ultimately we went down to LA and we filmed a crowdfunding video and we worked with a company called tilt and we we launched our crowdfunding campaign trying to break a hundred thousand dollars to get that minimum order quantity and we're fortunate enough that within an hour we broke through our goal and ultimately went on to be the largest food crowdfunding campaign of all time raising in excess of three million dollars which was was really awesome so today we are headquartered in downtown Los Angeles and we have over 50 employees we've served over 20 million meals to date we've grown about 300 percent year over year since shipping and you know as you can see from this shot of our office we have you know people and large computers and high ceilings which I'm told are all indicative of success whoa okay there we go so essentially what I wanted to talk about today is acting against conventional wisdom and violating some of these sort of cultural norms can be very important to generating interest in your business and so a lot of people you know it would be anxious about sort of communicating how to consume a powdered food or maybe you should consume a powdered food and we were but ultimately we really had no choice so we had to realize that our solution was a little bit weird and we had to stick to our principles and and so we went about trying to solve this problem what to eat and so we had this unusual product and so again we were anxious about it we were trying to figure out how do we communicate this message most effectively so that makes people comfortable so that they'll understand that this is really a very viable solution to eating when you're hungry so initially we got some reaction that was what we fear apparently some people can't be bothered with food Soylent raises 1 million dollars reminds us what's wrong with Silicon Valley I what's wrong with Silicon Valley Rob Reinhardt holes no eating diet probably isn't such a good idea I'll let you read that caption on that photo for yourself so ultimately we realize we're gonna have our work cut out for us if we were gonna try to communicate how normal and really soothing our solution was so we decided we had to embrace the weird right there are just inherently weird things about our business that we shouldn't try to hide behind we can't hide behind even if we want to so instead of trying to sort of make excuses we'll just go the extra mile so I don't know what what could we think about that might sort of communicate the idea of a fictional foodstuff that is everything that the body needs and really great for survival so an allusion to a 1960s science fiction novel by Harry Harrison called make room make room which was ultimately adapted into a movie called Soylent Green Soylent Green is a fictional foodstuff that has everything that the body needs to be healthy it also happens to have a secret ingredient that some people find distasteful no pun intended which is humans right so as you can see the reaction when naming this product is is pretty strong a lot of people will seem to remember one of the adaptations of this sci-fi story in which the secret ingredient of people is you know is very sort of memorable so ultimately you know this joke never gets old right and so every post that we put on Facebook every ad that we put out was very polarizing right because of the sort of the harsh sort of nature of the name and sort of what it made some people think about but ultimately it drove a ton of engagement right you know the the number of comments that we have on every post every ad every time sort of someone who hasn't heard of us sees us for the first time it drives us engagement it drives this interest that ultimately is very valuable and drives a lot of impressions that we might not normally get otherwise you know these comments my marketing teams favorite comments I think one of them is why didn't they Google this fire the marketing team fire the marketing team haters so there's this old saying in advertising you know basically the concept is you know if you're trying to sell glue and all else fails glue a car to a wall so that's essentially what Rob did when he lived on Soylent for 30 days right he did this stress test this if I can live on this for 30 days then certainly I can use this to replace a meal or a series of meals or replace meals for several days in a row and so this was an extremely compelling and very important part of our start and something that ultimately drove tons and tons of engagement and and and it was just essentially invaluable and so and so he blogged about his experience as well and further drove home violating these cultural norms around food and and how people saw food so you know saying things in you know new blog posting interviews like I don't understand why people want to eat as if they were cave in we have super computers in one hand and then we're shoveling leaves into our mouth with the other right and that is you know a little bit strange in contradictory and so the idea of why can't a food like every other problem be reduced into its constituent parts and so the idea that you know an apple is more than the sum of its ingredients is is something that you know we we wanted to challenge so along those lines so along those lines you know we used scientific principles to design our formula and design our ingredients and what we ultimately wanted to do was to use the best tools for the job and so to us we're ingredient agnostic I don't care if we get our protein from whey or soy or rice what matters is the amino acid profile and the amino acid ratio the source is less relevant so you know in the case of something like GMOs this is very unusual again right because it's contradictory from what a lot of other food companies do if you walk into a Whole Foods now you see vegan natural organic non-gmo and really you know what what our belief is that consumers have been taught because in the past food companies have been dishonest historically and consumers have been taught that these labels are proxies for good health so if I see something that says natural I can be confident that it's healthy but things like hemlock are natural and that doesn't always end up so great you know when you consume that substance so things like GMOs are very very important for the future of Agriculture and there's an entire debate around them which is too long to get into right now but our corporate stance is that we're very Pro and by taking out billboards and not trying to sort of get away with anything being there straight forward and open about our preference that was something that also generated more interest again another thing being transparent about our formula people say don't tell people what's in your food product they'll copy you well that's fine people did copy us and we also engaged with and created a community around making Soylent and making their own Soylent and so this was very very powerful for us because they drove a lot of traffic to our forums and our subreddit and helped create a conversation and convert more people to our banner of thinking and and again ultimately was was very very good in terms of driving traffic and ultimately sales right then we sold food exclusively online only e-commerce at the time a little bit uncommon and something that people said you know you're a food product you need to go into stores that's the only way that people will buy you but you know from our perspective we wanted to be passing on as much value to our consumers as possible and because of all the financial implications involved in being in a store it wouldn't allow us to charge the affordable price that we would like to charge you know as we scale and and and make sure that we're actually passing on as much value to our consumers as we'd like and ultimately again this was a good decision because it enabled us to generate cash flow to continue to scale and invest in R&D which I'll get to in a second our marketing some food products want to tell you that they will make you superhuman I will not promise you that I will tell you that if you drink Soylent you'll be healthy and you'll be able to get more things done and so that is a message that is very much resonated with our consumers and something that you know ironically I think by keeping your clothes on you can generate more attention sometimes iterating our product like software we had a lot of ideas about where we wanted to take our product and what the ideal vision of our sort of end product would be but we had a crowdfunding campaign we had customers waiting and we couldn't iterate and make it perfect and so in software this is very common right you you release versions but in food a little bit less common and so we put out our first version so we lent 1.0 that had an oil bottle associated with it and and that's because saturated fats as many of you likely know are solid often in room temperature and so if you want a high monounsaturated fat profile then often you know you need to resolve to consume liquid fat ultimately by Soylent 1.4 we were able to work out a deal with a supplier to generate a custom starch micro encapsulated fat blend that enabled us to throw away the oil bottle and keep everything in one pouch much more convenient ultimately we got to the ready to drink again we have samples here so then just high level as you can see the more unusual things that we did not by being deliberately unusual but by sticking to our principles and understanding that we could go one way or the other and we might as well embrace our weirdness enabled us to generate a lot of interest and drive press and drive our community and again ultimately drive sales quick word about our reddit community so a reddit community is a fine example of all of the sort of different communities and that we have in the reddit community actually receives more hits per month than our website sometimes and so that's an extremely powerful resource that we have and we look to them for ideas and we are able to engage directly with our customers and because we have such a vibrant community it's really been been quite beneficial to us you know in a number of ways throughout the history of our business so okay sorry there we go so a quick word about being unusual and being weird so it's not all rainbows and butterflies sometimes some really frustrating things happen so that's stress test that I mentioned earlier really really effective for us as a business really important one of the most important things that we did right stress testing showing that our product could stand up to a very high-pressure situation generated a lot of interest but then people were so interested they continued to replicate it and take it further and further and so people wanted to live on Soylent for 30 days and recreate that experiment and journalists wanted to do it and it was a very interesting thing and people were we're very interested in it and and we think that's great the products designed for that why not however that led to a mistaken assumption that we're still combating a little bit today with regard to what Soylent is used for some people still regard Soylent is something that i'm on Soylent all I consume is Soylent I don't understand why someone would want to live that kind of lifestyle when of course Soylent is a tool that you can use as needed for you so of course if you can live for 30 days you can certainly use it for breakfast so that's you know that's just something to be aware of with some of these sort of tactics but ultimately you know we don't really regret anything as far as being a little bit weird being a little bit unusual and challenging some of these cultural norms so I just want to reiterate that I think it's better to disagree with conventional wisdom if you know that you're right ultimately you'd be surprised how it can actually benefit you so as far as what's next for Soylent we released 2.0 last fall again we have samples here so if you didn't eat breakfast there's no excuse after this to go grab a Soylent you'll thank me later trust me and with regard to the far farther future this is an example of an industrial fermentation tank so 30% roughly of Soylent 2.0 as calories come from algal fat so that is lipid oil or oil that's extracted from algae in a tank such as this this is sort of a pilot so think about like a brewery that has a tank full of algae and then you French press it and you take all of the really healthy very clean very efficiently made fats and then you can put it into food products such as ours so we strongly believe that the future of ingredient production is through microbial engineering so ingredient production through microbes and so instead of two-dimensional farmland you really have these three tanks that can grow in warehouses that you can stamp all over the world and that's something that we're really focusing a lot of our time and effort and our D spend on so again we want to provide nutrition to the world and so we are not afraid to be a little bit weird and leverage the power of science to make sure that we can accomplish that and make sure that everybody has enough to eat thank you very much all right two quick things so just kind of as the day moves forward this is we're gonna be doing a QA so if you guys do have a question just kind of work your way down we have time for about two here second thing if anybody needs a business idea make better clickers sorry about that David but I actually have a question myself so you know obviously we had somebody live off Soylent for 30 days you guys did it as well I know we had our guy do a blood test before and after what would like someone's blood test look like after living off your product for 30 days just kind of curious well ideally they shouldn't deviate at all from the norm and so you know what we really like to see in sort of a win case but that's sort of when the deck is stacked in our favor is someone has metrics sort of outside the healthy range and then after the Soylent diet they're within it and so you know I think it's one of these things where no news is good news in that case thanks for your presentation you described briefly the crowdsourcing that you did would you be able to elaborate on why it was so six why you think it was so successful and characteristics of it that you would recommend to include or not include during that process sure yeah I think with regard to crowdfunding I think you know some of these I think are well catalogued and at this point and so I'm not sure if I'm doing it justice but for us you know things like ensuring that we had press interest before launching the campaign you know making sure that our PR and our relationship with some key reporters was good having a community who was already interested in the product that was able to help us see that campaign working with a great partner like tilt that took a special interest in helping us succeed I think we're sort of the the critical factors there I'm curious if you guys looked at spirulina as a protein source what do you think of that and also maybe some non-essential elements like boron nutrition especially performance-enhancing sure yeah I think that's a great point so okay so first question spirulina super interesting definitely has a lot of potential with regard to incorporation but one of the things that we really have to consider is taste and texture and also of course if we're talking about spirulina either it depends what nutrient soom you're talking about protein and so the the protein extraction process at this point hasn't reached industrial scale and isn't very cost effective something that we could potentially be interested in in driving towards ourselves with regard to things like boron other sort of quote-unquote non-essential things I think that you know it with regard to these products that we have out on the market right now our value prop is really to provide everything that's essential and so with regard to some of these non essentials it's definitely something that we're interested in but with regard to something that we sort of have to have in our product it's not something that is super critical for us right now sure that's all the time we have for questions thank you David yep you

George thanks for taking the time uh you're an incredible guy fascinating guy George and I got a chance to catch up earlier uh and I think you guys are really going to enjoy what he has to say um so George one of the things that we talked about was just how you got started in business and I found it fascinating because you know when you were starting that business in 1973 it's just very very different from the way that businesses are kind of started in San Francisco Silicon Valley these days uh so can you tell us about a little bit about kind of the founding of men's warehouse and how basically you started with $77,000 and a business plan well uh sure Tom I had seven Grand which went for first and last month's rent so that left us with a zero balance and uh that's why the very first commercial that Men's Warehouse ever ran I was not the spokesperson the tagline was the only thing better than a friend in the business is a father in the business and I had a father who was able to arrange $100,000 of uh credit so that I could actually have inventory when I started yeah that's awesome so so you got started $7,000 $100,000 of inventory how did you make that first step towards finding customers and start to build the the mega brand that you know Men's Warehouse became well of course the advertising uh originally was just newspaper and then it morphed into uh television and radio and this was before there were uh PCS and social media so this was the way to develop a business um it was very different than the business I'm starting now in which you have to lay out the entire business spend all the money up front and then hope that you were right and you get customers yeah yeah and and the TV side of things is amazing because you know I think I heard a stat uh that $6 billion went into kind of promoting your face uh TV which is just incredible um how did you how did that first TV by come into existence can you tell that story CU I thought it was uh just amazing well uh my I had a uh a friend who uh a new friend I met him at a wedding in 1974 and he was in the advertising business in New York and uh talked to me about my startup and and said you know maybe I ought to look at putting the entire $335,000 advertising Budget on television uh I said okay we'll do that we made some commercials and he flew down from New York and walked into our store and said you don't have enough inventory I'm going to delay the commercials by 30 days so so you immediately after taking your $35,000 marketing budget he says you have to spend that much more on on inventory to actually even be able to run the $35,000 TV by exactly yeah that's incredible uh so first TV ad goes out um did it instantly work was it was it the the Boon to your business that you were hoping it would be well back in uh the mid 70s when when this began there were in most cities in the United States uh between three and five television stations so when you ran a television commercial you were getting a a huge audience so I would say within 3 weeks of starting on television the business started to pick up and it basically continued that way with uh a couple of minor interruptions for uh the entire 40 years I was there and and how did you evolve the brand from you know nothing better than than or the only thing better than having a friend in the business as a father in the business to you're going to like the way you look I guarantee it well the uh uh you may recall that uh there was a movie in the80s with Bill Murray named stripes and uh he has this famous line in the movie where he says uh when asked if he's part of the United States Army he says that's the fact Jack and uh I wanted to say that in an ad lib at the end of an early commercial I did and realized that was inappropriate for commercial TV so I quickly uh self-edited it to uh I guarantee it in and then in the late '90s a very uh smart uh television director uh inserted the words you're going to like the way you look in front of uh I guarantee it and we thought that made it even more powerful and and how much of that do you credit to your voice well uh the way I look at advertising today is that advertising is more about repetition and consistency than it is creativity uh now that may be changing as uh we move away from TV and radio and into social media but my voice uh became uh what we used to say was is that if somebody is in the kitchen getting a snack and the commercial comes on they're still going to know it's a Men's Warehouse commercial even if if they can't see it uh yeah absolutely I mean that was the voice that sold me my first suit so I appreciate that um so so so you mentioned kind of creative um how do you so how do you see creatives role now that you're running generation tux and you're relying a little bit more on social media as opposed to the TV buys that you had built Men's Warehouse on well uh you know looking at uh for instance your uh creative it's uh uh it's it's fantastic and it it it presents uh for relatively small dollars the opportunity to create a very positive brand image uh so I think there's a uh a fantastic opportunity today for uh young creatives in in startups um but I still stick to uh that if if you're looking for uh scalability in business it's hard to get away from television and it's hard to get away from repetition and advertising yeah I'm curious so so in terms of like spikes in Men's Warehouse did you notice any big spikes along the way I think there was that that initial one but that were associated with The Branding or the content that you were developing or just merely uh you know repetition and expansion well I hadn't actually thought about that I'm sure there were uh spikes but for the most part it was a fairly steady upward slope that the Men's Warehouse enjoyed for a long time I mean up until uh 2013 certainly there was a downturn during the ' 0809 recession there was a a short uh down glitch uh after 911 uh for those that are old enough to remember when Wall Street dropped 500 points in one day in 1987 there are those types of uh oneoff uh uh problems but for the most part uh it was really just running the same story over and over until much like uh uh some of the other iconic campaigns whether it's Mr Whipple or uh Tony the Tiger or the alas eler man you you're not sure if you're getting sick of the commercial or actually starting to fall in love with it but uh uh one or the other I think it works equally well and and so you know we talk about creating a brand um were you you know was the brand that the men Men's Warehouse was building was that very concerted was that premeditated and you thought this is the exact sentiment I want want this customer to have or did it kind of naturally happen because you're a charismatic guy and and have that you know illustrious voice that we can hear so well well I'm not sure how to answer that question I mean when I started Men's Warehouse uh I really was was was going into business not to get rich uh but because I wanted to be the architect of my own life and I didn't want to have a boss telling me what I had to do every day or every week um I think as the company unfolded one of the things that made the company successful was that it it did uh uh follow my own uh personality and and and Persona and and so we never had to change our corporate culture our corporate culture was from basically day one the same until the day I was fired I believe in the three years sins uh the culture has probably diminished yeah and you mentioned something interesting when we were talking is is the mission that you had in your advertising was not to uh sway someone with emotion but rather present the information and let the customer make their own decision based on the information that you presented you know I'm not sure I I'll I'll uh tell this uh story but I'm not sure that it's actually right and and the evidence would be what you're doing now in your company is is not about uh the rational side of life it's about the emotional side that's what your marketing is and most marketing is thought to be better if it speaks to the emotions and not to reason but when I was becoming uh the spokesperson for Men's Warehouse uh I wanted it to be based on on reason and and not on emotion and so for instance we never used uh sexuality or scantily clad women as other clothing stores did to sell merchandise we tried to make it about uh facts and and value and do you think that that has something to do with the product because you know business and and kind of you know business attire is probably a little bit more rational a little bit more concrete what we're selling is is a little is a little bit more out there and a little bit more oriented towards the weekend which maybe is a more emotional time you know I I think that it's more uh about the difference between your generation and mine I think that baby boomers uh uh like to Pride themsel on uh a a a surplus of reason and a shortage of emotion and I think that uh your generation understands that it doesn't have to be an either or opposition and that it's probably uh more powerful to Market with emotion yeah absolutely um so so that kind of takes us to this generation so you said kind of when you started Men's Warehouse it was get to get that freedom you wanted to Be Your Own Boss now with generation tux is that the same drive or is it something different no it's totally different um when you uh have had a successful career for 40 years you don't have to worry about being your Your Own Boss uh uh in your second act uh this is really about as it's evolved about my legacy because I really uh would like to uh number one uh uh be successful but I'd also like to send the message to my friends and family and to the uh General Community uh that uh just because you're a on Medicare doesn't mean that you're not capable of uh of doing a startup and so it's it's it's actually I wouldn't say it's as much fun the second time around but it's close and so so you started one business in 73 one business in 2015 is when you guys went public publicly launched uh how different are these worlds of of trying to build a brand well you know since this is a uh mostly uh younger audience I think one of the uh biggest differences is that when I started Men's Warehouse there were no computers to speak of so we had a manual inventory control system that we created which was with circles and an X through the circle when the Garment was sold if if you can imagine I I ran the company for close to a decade with that inventory control system uh today uh obviously with big data uh there is so much information available that it really is uh not even like talking about the same thing anymore yeah and and how about like with the Advent of the internet and branding and marketing how has that changed well you know we never had to uh be aware of where on our website we were losing traffic right that didn't exist even when Men's Warehouse developed a website in the '90s you back then you were not able to look at uh page views and determine where people were dropping out now uh with big data you can uh get this incredibly microscopic look at what your customers are interested in and where you're losing their interest yeah absolutely so so speaking of customers one of the things that you talk a lot about is this notion of conscious capitalism of thinking about both the shareholders and the stakeholders uh having an eye towards your customers and your employees kind of first and foremost and that's something that I think is is kind of tantamount to uh or is is just very important to success in kind of today's companies uh can you explain a little bit about kind of conscious capitalism um and and how you how you view its role in business well in 1992 when Men's Warehouse went public and I went to Wall Street to uh set it up uh and explain my ideas on on I I actually call it stakeholder capitalism uh

everyone how's the conference going all right so he told me I was supposed to start by telling my story but he just told my story so um hopefully we can maybe make the speech part of this a little bit shorter and do a little bit more q& um so basically uh there's a big black box in the middle of my story there's probably a message in there somewhere um but you can read all that so I'll just do a quick I'll do a quick voiceover I um I was born in the cornfields of Illinois um and spent my childhood uh doing a bunch of things that you do in the cornfields um certainly nothing that would prepare me for a life of Entrepreneurship um and then I went to college I was in the college in the late '90s everyone here is way younger than me way younger than that um and my class was the first class in my college that was assigned an email address which I thought it was pretty interesting at the time um I studied applied math um one of my biggest regrets is not studying computer science um I I think I should have and um I mean applied math is plenty hard enough uh but for some reason I decided not to do that um one of my friends um on Thanksgiving of our senior year reserved a domain name called spark.com and started putting up some content and he sent me a link to the content and said you should check this out and I was like this is just silly um so I ignored it and I went through the through the regular recruiting process um and I ended up um getting a job with the consulting firm and I was all set to become a consultant and then he emailed me again and he said hey Sam I've now got a few hundred thousand people visiting we had unique visitor we didn't have Ma at the time we had unique visitors um and he was like hey I've got a few hundred thousand unique visitors you should really check this out um and at the time in the late 90s it was still there were still so many ideas that hadn't been done yet Now you kind of have to be really creative to start a new company you have to like create some app that does something that you've got to like concoct two two or three ideas together but at the time there were just all these obvious things that hadn't been done yet um and so we started this company called the spark.com we'll get into more of that later um but we basically pivoted that business uh to be Spark Notes um we sold that company uh we got very lucky we sold the company 6 weeks before the market crashed in 2000 um I sold it uh as Sam said for way too much money um and then the company we sold it to not a business uh 11 months later so that's what you get for buying a company for way too much money a lesson to be learned but for some reason is never learned by acquirers um I then started a company called e donkey anyone here remember e donkey okay peer-to-peer file sharing um that was a very interesting ride for me uh get it okay um it was a very interesting ride um ended up getting sued by the record labels for a billion dollars uh testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee uh started a a lobbying group to try to Lobby Congress I've got a whole bunch of War stories about that that I'm happy to talk about I actually went and got an MBA which I know is generally scorned uh and looked down upon in the Tech Community um and then decided to go back at it and start Okay Cupid with the same Founders that I started spark notes with we sold the company to match um while it took us like eight months to build spark notes into a business we could sell it took us eight years to build OK Cupid into a business we could sell um sold it to match and then expected to do my year at match and get out that's what most entrepreneurs do when they sell their company um but the folks at M match took a huge gamble on me and offered to make me CEO of match um and I went from one day running a $10 million business with 30 employees to running a billion dollar business uh with a thousand employees all around the world um and that was a huge huge learning experience for me I spent three and a half years as the CEO of match while I was the CEO of match um we most famously incubated Tinder and grew it into one of the most successful uh startups uh really ever um it's certainly one of the most successful startups that come out of a corporate um uh come out of a corporation um we spent about a billion dollars on Acquisitions around the world and then we had an IPO last November so that was my that was my three and a half year run as CEO of match um and then thanks um and then while I was doing all that I I moved back to Chicago and I'm very passionate about the Chicago Tech Community um so I started what is now Tech Stars Chicago and we've graduated 60 companies through that program in the last six years um and then I started a small little venture capital fund uh called Corone Capital um where I really have a totally different approach to how um the relationship that VCS and entrepreneurs should have together and I think my my 16 years as an operator I think I bring a very different approach to to how to mentor and how to develop great entrepreneurs so that's kind of what I've been up to but they asked me to talk about content is it commodity you've heard both content is just a commodity or content is king so I'm going to take you way back into the 9s um to our site called the spark.com and we again in the span of just a year became known as uh we won basically a dozen awards at sight of the year in 1999 because of our contents um and here's an example of some content that we wrote it was called the fat project we found Eric and Nicole and we offered them $3,000 if they could gain 30 PBS in 30 days how many of you think you could gain 30 pounds in 30 days it's impressive okay so uh basically this was like reality TV before reality TV um or reality internet before reality internet um we took pictures of them in their underwear every day for 30 days this is I won't take you through all 30 days you can find it on the internet here's day 15 let's go back day zero day 15 get in there all right so here's a question if this is day Zero and this is day 30 do you think either of them made it how many of you how many of you think Eric made it how many of you think Nicole made it no so it turns out you guys are kind of wrong Eric made it Nicole didn't and what Eric was was able to do is really nail day 30 I mean he gained 6 lbs in the span of two hours which which is pretty impressive um and so you can imagine we were just we were kind of doing this every single day and this became a total viral sensation on the internet so we said okay that fat project was pretty cool what else can we do so we did something called stinky feet where uh one of our edit Christian Rudder who's now of okay TRS Fame uh tried to give himself athletes foot uh he literally like walked around like locker rooms and shower stalls and with no feet on for 30 days um stinky meat we just put a plate of rotting meat out in the yard and watched the maggots uh it's all good stuff um and then we did stinky meat 2 because it was so good to do stinky meat one um so this was an example of a business that um you know based on content generated um a ton of value in just a few months we did something else called um these personality quizzes we were really the first company in the 90s to do personality quizzes um you'll this was not the final tallies but these quizzes were taken over 100 million times um in one year this was pre-social pre any of the sort of built-in verality uh uh systems that we now have today this is all just sorry this is all just on the quality of the content that we built and then we built e-cards e-cards were a thing in the '90s one of my favorites I don't know just think about it um and uh so the the problem with this kind of content though is that you have to constantly produce humorous content and we we realized by the time we decided to become a company but even before we incorporated as an as a corporate entity we decided the humor business is a crappy business to be in because you have to be funny every single day so we thought to ourselves well what other business can we be in we've got all these millions of users what else can we do and so we looked up I was in Chris's dorm room and we looked up and he had Cliffs notes up on his shelf and my other partner Max just looked up and said we should do spark notes we didn't do any market research we didn't do any ideation on the name the name just kind of came to us and we started making spark notes and uh um we find we found 10 of our English major friends any of you English Majors yeah so it turns out turns out English Majors will work English Majors will work for free almost um so we basically went to these English majors and said you just spent $100,000 on your education paying our school to let you write papers we're going to pay you $400 to write a paper for us and so these 10 English students went out on their spring breaks and they wrote spark notes and they get brought them back we put them up on the site and we got all this hate mail from our users who said I can't believe you don't have my book which is great it's a great kind of hait mail to get and so we went we produced another 100 Spark Notes over the summer and launched and really in the span of one year killed Cliffs notes which had been around for 50 years um now a lot of people ask well Spark Notes wasn't about the content it was just because it was free um and so it wasn't it was a commodity but there were tons and tons and tons of study guides out there um and yeah we were better marketers yeah we had a better brand but at the end of the day um you know it was a no-brainer to students that we were better and it was even you know pretty clear from professors and and journalism and journalists that Spark Notes were the best and so that pair of businesses the spark and Spark Notes was the business that we built in 11 months and sold uh first to an internet company called iturf and then later to Barnes and& Nole So Okay Cupid um is a business I've been working on for the last 12 years um I feel bad for anyone trying to do dating businesses they're really hard um and the hardest part about them is how do you build critical mass right how do you get the liquidity and the way we did it was with content um we went back to The Well of the of the quizzes that we had built at at the spark and we said well let's build an online dating personality test and let's make the personalities that you can get really really funny so we had 32 different personality types you don't have to read all this the conference organizers said you can't have more than 50 words on a slide it's like who makes that kind of rule um so anyway I think there are more than 50 words but I'm I'm a rule breaker I don't know what to tell you um but we had all these different personality types and people would post their personality types all around the web and that was how we drove a lot of traffic to OK Cupid in the in the early days we then said well let's let's keep going down this content Road and let's use content to help people find their matches um at the time e-harmony was one of the market leaders have you guys seen the e-harmony commercials with the old guy and the granddaughter isn't that creepy um so I I never understood that Marketing Concept um but we yeah right but we basically let people write their own questions and these are just eight questions that I found um and we let people what I have no idea what he's saying anyway we're going to go to okay so basically so so we let we let users create the content um and then we created algorithms that sorted the content sorted the questions um that allowed the most interesting content to come to the top and so these are just some of the questions they're actually very interesting questions if you read them and think about um what your answer would be and then what you would want a potential date how you'd want a potential date to answer them but we're going to take a quick segue out of this conversation and do some audience interaction okay so show of hands how many people enjoy horror movies okay um have you ever traveled alone in a foreign country okay and wouldn't it be fun to cheuck it all and go live on a sailboat okay of the thousands and thousands of questions that are in our database those are the only three that predict relationship success if you and a potential date both agree yes yes or no no on these three questions you are statistically more likely to end up in a successful relationship okay uh show of hands oops sorry show of hands for men uh if you would answer yes to any of the questions on the left under men please raise your hand men and leave leave them up for a second okay women how many women like the taste of beer okay hands up keep your hands up everyone who's raising their hands right now are statistically more likely to have sex on a first date so hopefully you paid attention to there's a party tonight right so hopefully all of you were paying close attention to that back to the regularly scheduled programming so we have all this interesting content right and so we and we knew that yes we were using this content to drive to to do improve our matching algorithms we were using this content for targeting ads but we thought we can really use this target this content to go drive more traffic and so we did what many people do and we called the pr firm and this was the friendly PR firm that we called shorts Communications up in Boston and they said great we'd love to take on the account and so we started mining our data and one of the first pieces of nugget one of the first Nuggets of data that we got was that when gas prices go up people narrow their search radius super awesome right like it's like after you say it out loud it's obvious that that should happen but it actually happens right that's so cool and so I was like I was so excited right it's like yes we have this great finding we had Schwarz called 100 journalists every one of the 100 journalists was like oh my God that is so cool and every one of the 100 journalists said I'm not writing a story today on the effective gas prices on dating called me back next week with your next little nugget and so we did this over and over and over again and for a year for six months and no one really ever wrote any stories about the things we wanted them to write stories about and so we said well screw it we're going to you know we'll pivot we'll try something else we'll iterate and so we started blogging um and it in the blog okay Trends became ultimately Super Famous um but it took us a while to get our footing and I should say I should give all the credit to Chris and Christian who did the writing I just get to talk about it um we first thought that we would have to be really provocative with our talks and so this was the very first blog post we wrote um and I remember thinking when it went up I remember thinking wow do we really want to like we're trying to build like a dating brand that people feel good about do we really want rape fantasy to be the thing that everyone Associates with Okay Cupid and but but you know Chris and Christian were very they said look we have to be provocative we have to go out there and we have to like sort of Scream real loud to get the attention first of all some super interesting findings I mean Wyoming who knew um any yomit in here no okay um so anyway so this was this was the very first blog post we did um but it turns out that that actually wasn't what we needed the data was so powerful that first finding of like gas and and and gas prices and search radius that kind of stuff was actually much ended up being much more compelling it just had to be packaged the right way these ended up being um some of the most successful blog posts that we wrote and you'll see none of these are clickbait none of these are artificial none of these are pro are especially provocative um but these are these are the kinds of posts that we put up that got millions and millions and millions of um of shares and reads and Views and there was a time in the summer of 2010 where we were literally on the front page of a Sunday Times section three three weeks in a row um one was Sunday style one was arts and one was business where where the New York Times was basically just saying this content is unbelievable I would argue um I would argue that the blog probably is the primary reason why we were able to sell our company um and probably on its own in the span of a few months probably generated I don't know 2030 million of equity value to the business um and with that um that's it so we I'm two minutes early so we get two extra minutes of Q&A or we can all go drink faster all [Music] [Applause] right be better with a mic it's it's probably an obvious uh answer but so with the uh the weight challenge uh you said you would pay them if they reached 30b or increased 30 lounds I'm going to guess that you get to pay you pay them anyways right uh for both of them like we definitely we definitely paid Eric cuz he made it woman though yeah we probably yeah we give ni yeah we paid nich okay yeah simple enough wow that's the question all right hey Sam yo uh in today's day age internet's flooded with content flooded with bloggers that have tons of knowledge about tons of things but we don't know what's important how would you stand out um I I think ultimately this goes back to uh my belief in the power of Brands um you know and and I I I kind of look at this through like the dating context right it's not exactly a Blog which is not really the world I live in right now but like do you know how many dating you know how many dating businesses have launched in the last decade hundreds do you know how many dating businesses launched in the last decade have any any noticeable amount of success one right and if you think of liquidity and users as content right It ultimately gets back to the fact that like all these all these businesses did not all these dating businesses didn't build Brands right they just found they thought they had like some slick way to get a few users or whatever but they weren't building sort of this lasting permanence and I think in the blog context you have to think over a very long time Horizon and just say like you know I want to build a reputation for being smart or funny or whatever it is and those people who do that over time can have sustainable Edge and advantage that you can't take away I think like clickbait and stuff like that is all very temporary and then you're just in an arms race and eventually you'll lose Hi Sam thanks so much for your talk um so quick question about content content seems like it could be extremely timec consuming so how do you evaluate the Impact versus the effort of um content creation um you know it of course it's a lot of work but you know I think startups are a lot of work and work is a lot of work um and I just you know think about producing content pre- interet you have to actually like go get things printed and get things distributed and you know your ability to you know make video content on the Fly you know use Twitter use you know social media to get your content out I think all the more I would actually go the other way which is because distribution is so easy now you can spend all your time on making great content and making and winning on Quality quality is a thing that you can give you sustainable Edge over time and you know I think too many people try to shortcut it they're like oh I just want to get more content out and that's almost never the right answer and just look who look look at the great content Brands out there and think about how they built it there are a few that did it on quantity and clickbait but the vast vast majority are just the best content out there hey Sam thanks for chatting with us my name is gar elely and the fact that your blog was was able to increase the value of a company 20 to $30 million is mindboggling to me I was curious to know you're kind of answering this as we go but I'm curious to know how that happened and what metrics you measured in order to determine its success in the early days we measured we had this I remember the first couple blog posts at the bottom we we had this sign up for Okay Cupid and share sign up and share and we were like couldn't figure out what we wanted people to do because we didn't know what our metrics were um and it turned out that um the Temptation was to get people to sign up for OK Cupid right cuz that's what everyone wants to we want them in the funnel right you want that email address you want to be able to do all the stuff you do after you get the email address um and it turned out that um again I'm a big believer in Brands I think that is your long-term differentiator and what we ended up realizing was that all that mattered about this was getting into becoming a household name right think about how many how many how many startups actually make it and you have to get out of San Francisco you have to go to a cornfield in Illinois you have to do people like that for the to be a great business to be a business that like is permanent to be a business that is you know you know that your kids will know about you're going to have to get to the cornfields and think about that right and so what we decided was we wanted to be a household name and the way to become a household name was to make sure to drive kpis and and metrics and to evaluate kpis and metrics that had that kind of breath and reach and so we were looking at things like how much press did we get right how many that that was really the primary thing that we were cared about how many interviews every time we did a blog post we'd end up on TV we'd end up in the in the New York Times we'd end up on all the influential blogs and there was a period of time in 2010 where I would argue the OK cubid blog was must read um in the in sort of digital media we would get requests from journalists to just say just please give me a 5minute warning before you post um people were offering to pay us lots of money to just get get the blog post a day early so they could already write the sort of you know analytical post about the blog post hey Sam uh spark notes and OK Cupid are such different audiences and they're solving such different problems what other Industries are next for you uh that's a good question um you know my current you know I think there was a thread between spark notes and OK Cupid and that was really sort of of producing best of breed content uh for free um with a brand voice that was um very different from the incumbents that were that tended to be studier and more conservative um Okay Cupid sort of really opened up big data and sort of all the appeal that comes with that I and I think whatever I do next I really want to think about how can we use data to do something else so whether it's in um uh e-commerce or something else I'm just super interested in in thinking about data what else we can do with it all right thank you Sam [Applause] thanks

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
how's it going uh yeah whenever I I always thought like it would be really cool going on a talk show because you get your own intro music and then John was telling me I don't know how the hell he came up with this song I was like I wonder what my intro music would be but anyway uh so uh my name's Jack uh as Sam was saying like um today I advise a few different St UPS uh but previously I'd founded a startup called vungle and uh yeah last year um I came down and I gave this talk about uh how I pulled off an insane marketing stunt using LinkedIn advertising uh to get the last spot at an incubator called Angel pad a bit kind of like y combinator um and uh that talks online if you want to check it out that um was quite popular talk um but Sam asked me to come down and basically talk about right what happened after you got into the accelerator um they gave us like $100,000 um but what happened afterwards and I want to also give uh you guys some tips like what worked for me uh some tips going into seed uh funding raising your kind of first round of funding I know during the Q&A for some of the other speakers some people had um questions on that like approaching Angel Investors and stuff so I want to give you some tips so um to kind of pick up where the story left off uh basically it was a Thursday and uh Angel pad told us all right guys you've got the last spot uh in our incubator and it starts on Monday so just get the first flight out to America uh we were in London at the time and uh you starts on Monday and so me and my business partner two of us got on our plane and Angel pad is basically like as said a bit like y combinator school for startups you have about 12 companies uh in each batch and what they make you do is you basically arrive we actually had our suitcases we're like turning up at the uh co-working space with our suitcases and the first thing you have to do is pitch your company to all of your other teams sitting down so we're basically sitting there listening to 11 other companies and we're quickly realizing like right all of these other companies the founders are like the most like totally legit Engineers like uh one team like they have phds in video encoding and worked at Google one guy had written YouTube's API and we were kind of the joke of the class uh basically me my business partner we're not engineers and so people were like all right guys you got a terrible idea that the idea has changed now but uh we have a terrible idea and you've got no one to actually build it like you guys are just going to flops so bad uh I actually remember um my business partner early on in the program one other team was getting a bit more investor interest you know a bit ahead of other companies they were kind of feeling bullish getting investor interest and um one of the founders actually came up to my business partner and uh he said hey I'll lead your fundraising round here's a quarter you're going to need it and my business partner was like so pissed off man like that just like got him psyched up and and so I just want to tell the story today like all right how did we go from like being the joke of the class to uh we raised the most money for the seed round at that class our seed round was $2 million uh dollars led by Google Ventures and then how did we become kind of breakout that's raised uh ra 25 million total and the most employ how did we go from being the joke to the breakout especially on a fundraising side uh and so I want to give you some tips about stuff that we may didn't know these tips but this has went well for us and noticed it didn't go as well for some of the other teams so to start off um see so one day it's a school for startups Ty office one day one of the founders from the other teams turns up in like a pinstriped suit looking like Gordon Gecko and we're like dude what are you doing like you you're nor you're an engineer you're normally dressing in like hoodies and startup t-shirts like why why you coming in a pinstriped suit what's what's the deal and um he basically said us like he was talking to other guys like all right you just see like who's an investor going to invest in he's going to invest in like me like looking presentable and um investable or is he going to invest in you guys like in hoodies and startup t-shirts Etc but the thing is what he didn't understand is that especially ra SE round it's not it's not it's not a a present it's not a a show that you're putting on it's not like hey let let me just dress up like he's in a hoodie all the time it's not like hey let me just put on my pinstriped suit I go to a VC boardroom I like stand up and I do my pitch and then I'm like hey do you do you want to give me money it it doesn't work like that they're investing in you as a person and what you're doing um and so basically what he was doing and what a lot of people raising money for the first time do is basically it can be quite daunting it's like hey this these VC xvc they're managing like a billion dollars under management and I've just got my tiny startup uh we're just getting off the ground like obviously they have all the control like what can I offer them so so startups basically going in basically they do their pitch and they're like hey so what do you think do you do you want to invest and you're basically just like begging for money you know that doesn't make you appealing to invest in and so the first tip that I've got is kind of to just change the dynamic of control that you've got in your head how you're thinking about approaching the fundraising don't be putting yourself down and putting them on this like another level like they're like Gods you know um sorry what happened with vungle and this is you can't really manufacture this because VCS they're going to be meeting hundreds of entrepreneurs a year right so you can't really manufacture this but to give you an example of the complete flip opposite of the last slide uh when we were raising the seed round for vungle initially we own wanted uh we well we didn't think we could raise any money so we started out thinking hey let's try raise $500,000 and what happened is uh once we got to $500,000 then the meetings changed because you're going into to meet a VC and you're talking like hey this is what we do blah blah and they're likey okay cool uh how much money are you raising and we're like we're raising half a million dollars and like okay cool uh so how much have how much have you raised how much of the round is left and we're like well we've actually already got half million and so they're like okay well why are you meeting us and we were telling the truth like basically at the time it was like well look we've heard really good things about you and for the right partner then maybe we'd like consider raising a bit more money and so here what you get is the VC is basically having to pitch the VCS were basically pitching us like this is why you should consider raising more and to let us invest so if you think about the dynamic the decision- making Dynamic from the previous one an entrepreneur might go in and like this is what I do do you want to invest and VC is making the decision here they were pitching us like would you consider raising more to to make space for us and so we're having a decision to make so those the flip opposit it's hard to manufacture this but you can at least do more of a Level Playing Field and so the Level Playing Field is thinking all right I'm not going in um begging for cash and they're sitting on a billion dollars no matter who it is a VC's job is to be finding cool startups they're paranoid all the time as well like um Jason kakan spoke earlier that guy that missed out on Uber and how his like still upset with himself his job is to find cool startups like you and sure you he's got money or he or she has got money and you want that but it's a Level Playing Field and so you should be having a conversation um and that leads me into my next tip which is um basically that for your pitch deck your fundraising pitch deck some of the best meetings we had we never even got the deck out we just had a conversation uh actually our series uh uh VC invested in our seed round and then led the series a when we met them we actually met him in his in his living room uh he was just like in his slippers and his like four-year-old daughter's like running around but that was a great environment because we're it's you know is not in a boardroom where you're like coming in give presentation we're in just an informal setting so going for coffee meetings and stuff like that can be great and so if you make your pitch deck like a picture book so this is one of the slides from our our seed round deck you see it's like big pictures not much text at all like maximum like one sentence like this is like a two-year-old's book like a two-year-old picture book would look like this right but the thing is if you make your debt like this even if you don't get the get the deck out when you're just having that conversation with the VC you can be thinking in your head you can be thinking what your slide deck looks like in your head so you could be like okay because it's like a picture book it's like chapters right so you're like all right first I'm going to talk about the team then I'm going to talk about the market size then I'm going to talk about like our traction so you can having the deck you struct so it feels like a natural conversation but you've got structure to the conversation because you're thinking about your deck in your head some Pitch decks or startups they try and cram all their information onto the slide you have like cash flow forecast and like decision- making and like so much text one no one's actually going to read that and two they shouldn't be reading your slides um they should just this should just be giving structure to a natural conversation um that's where it works best where you can build a relationship another tip it would be to make your traction whatever your traction is different for different people make it memorable one one startup I met recently like this is just made up but um their traction slide actually have more stuff than this it's like hey we've got like 2,000 downloads and like 200 of those are like active users and 300 of them are like monthly and then 10% conversion rate and what the hell and an investor is like not going to remember that coming out it's like hey the startup's doing amazing like okay how how are they doing amazing uh I don't know they had like loads of stats what we did with vungle and like what you could do is have like one headline figure whatever your headline figure is downloads users money revenue and a time frame can also that makes your growth kind of seem more explosive like if you're like hey we just launched three weeks ago and we got 2,000 users then that's like okay cool that's growing pretty fast if you didn't have the time frame that could be like okay you've got 2,000 users like did you launch two years ago like you know this gives it a bit of Framing and it's also more memorable so when you go out um that VC can be telling their Partners uh yeah this company's killing it like they just got like 2,000 downloads in the last week so think about the story of whatever your traction metric you choose is last last tip is um be able to describe what your business does in the frame of a tweet um because you've got to think like as I said they're coming out the meeting and if I'm psyched about a company I'm vising you different on and I'm telling my friend about it I've got to pitch your startup when when I'm pitching when I when you leave the meeting you're not there anymore so how am I going to describe you uh if you've used so much jargon and crazy stuff that only you can understand what you're doing that's not going to work you know um so seoa one of the top VCS one of the partners that had a story that he met this team of um uh amazing Engineers um but they were using so much jargon and like so complicated how they describing what they're doing and he's like look I I don't actually understand what you do uh here's a deal here's a business card right on the back what you do I'm I'm going to go outside for like 5 minutes when I come back uh describe your business you can only use the words you've written on this business card because he wanted it to be hey just make a simple description what you do right so he left the room and he came back and um the engineer as I said like a great engineer he had uh he' used kind of like short code he'd used like a a code to cram loads of words in so he had like a symbol that actually meant like a sentence and so they didn't end up getting investment from squ um one bit that can help with this an exercise could be if you ask your friends people that don't work with you but maybe if you've got roommates uh partner girlfriend boyfriend whoever around you ask them if you were going to tell someone else about my business or if you were you were going to pitch my business how would you describe it and you can listen to the words that they use and um if they describe something totally which your business doesn't do that then you really then you should realize like okay uh we need to rethink how we're talking about what we do you know um so hopefully that gave you some that was a quick bit just giving some different tips for if you're raising money for the first time or raising seed funding and hopefully that helped it's my email address happy to if anyone wants to reach out or if there's any questions anyone had now thanks a lot guys hey Jack my name is John uh I love your tactic on LinkedIn how to get investment congratulations um what's your plan for vungle and where are you taking it so I'm not working at vungle anymore um the two of us arrived me and my co-founder and um my co-founder is kind of leading it and two of us arrived off the plane uh and now there's like 180 of the team um and vungle what it does it basically does like video advertisements uh within mobile apps and games vungle really we were just like at the perfect timing because when we launched um mobile apps just use like banner ads and stuff and so video was very disruptive vangal today they keep on growing and actually different markets internationally have started to get quite big so V's got an office in China now and that generates quite a bit of Revenue so kind of when you have a model that works one of the next bits can be let's try and take this internationally and that's fal's bit at the moment do we have one more okay see hi my name's Gavin um how are you differentiated from Unity ads uh yes so there's a number of um companies uh in the same space as vungle um and it's the same with um lots of businesses to be honest when when we started vungle there wasn't really anyone else uh just doing video advertisements um Unity uh they kind of build a development platform and then let you uh put uh ads into that as part of it and bungle is separate so not all games are built in unity uh games might be built in other stuff I'm not the best to kind of pitch the differences but what I know is that app developers like having different choices they don't just want to have one company you know they want to have different choices and so vungle definitely from the stories I've heard of app developers uh feels kind of a need for a lot of people fair enough all right thank you thanks so it sounded like most of the talk was talking about what you did after that 500k yeah can you talk a bit about that first 500k and how you got to it sure yeah that's definitely a good point and it's important always to yeah I like to go into the depth of stuff so basically a lot of the initial investors we got we went to this Angel pad uh incubator and we met a number of people through this incubator um I can say we were raising um uh I don't got a bit limited time but um basically a number of the first people we met during the the incubator at the demo day we met some different people um and the first bit for us was getting the first raising half million the first bit was getting 250k okay once we got 250k anyone you go and meet you saying raising half a million we've already got half of it that's a bit more control the first part uh we'd built a relationship uh Google Ventures was the first one we'd built a relationship with them through the program so they saw us at the start and they saw like okay you guys are terrible and then they saw us at the end and they're like okay you've made a lot of progress and we also uh were're framing it like hey thanks so anyone that we met we like taking on their advice and we're like this is how we implemented it we also um got some of our first uh one of our very first uh angel investor had founded a company in the space um the bonobos founder also talked about this you know like has someone else started a company in the space or invested in a company in the space um I just cold emailed the founder of another company mobile ad company he' sold his company I was like hey looks like um you you're kind of legit in the space and you sold your startup I'd love to get your thoughts on what we're doing we went and met him showed him what we're doing and he's like hey uh I'm like by the way I actually like do some Angel Investing I'd love to invest so that's how we got the very first capital and that gave us way more credibility as well like hey this guy who's had an exit uh he's backing another mobile ad company cool thank you okay thanks all right thanks Jack all right thanks a lot [Applause] guys okay this is our last speaker before we

[Music] all right do we have any I will teach readers in the house let's hear it yes wow wow I did not expect that do we have any I will teach students anyone who's joined one of our premium courses in the house wow in the front row total nerds okay um so I want to talk to you today about some of the unconventional decisions we made that allowed us to build an unconventional business um I I'm going to take you through the business uh I'm going to take you through two key decisions just two that we made that I think are really important and you know I think that if you get these two things right your business is off to a solid start so this is me um I used to teach personal finance classes this is completely misleading because this is probably the most people I ever had in a room ever the average number of attendees was zero and the way I got into personal finance was when I grew up I came from a pretty big family and I needed to get scholarships to go to college so I did and the first check I got was for $2,000 so like any 17 18-year-old I took that money and I invested it in the stock market this is like the worst decision you could possibly make cuz I lost half of it immediately and I was like oh [ __ ] this is not a good start to my financial career so I started learning about personal finance and I started learning about psychology at the same time and I was studying um technology and psychology at Stanford and you remember that book The Emperor has no clothes right and they kind of call the emperor out that's how I felt about financial advice and everyone out there was saying don't spend money on lattes and keep a budget and my friends didn't give a [ __ ] about that they wanted to go out they wanted to have a good time they wanted their money to work for them so I started teaching these informal classes for free and school and usually zero people came um and that didn't work so for a year and a half it was really hard because I felt like I had something the world needed to hear and I knew that it was the right information but for some reason they just weren't listening and I later learned that you might have the best product or the best information but the way you communicate it is so profoundly important and so so I created a simple blog and I decided instead of trying to convince people to come to my classes I would let the right people come to me this is a super ghetto blog um it was some template that I found I didn't even know how to create archives I didn't put any ads or anything but this is the blog and I just started writing so fast forward until now it's expanded far beyond personal finance and we now have over 20 successful courses um I'm really proud of you these courses um many of them take us years and years to test and develop and you can see that we've covered the gamut of a rich life um there's you know everything from starting a business to copywriting to social skills I'm very interested in creating a parenting course um as you know there's nothing parents love better than to hear theories about parenting from non-parents so I'm going to hold off on that one for a while um a little bit about the business we have about a million monthly readers we have over 30,000 happy customers um we recently shared a post on Tim Ferris Blog My Friend Tim about how we had a $5 million week and all the math and methods behind that so kind of wanted to let you know the scale of the business but I'm less interested in talking about the financial side of it in fact we really never talk about our revenue or anything like that we'd prefer to brag about our students um and and our decision-making behind the scenes so I want to start with how do you go from that to this um this is the first product I ever sold as you can see I have a thing for titles and it was a $495 cent ebook and I had been writing my site for free for about 3 years I just decided I wanted to try and see if anyone would actually buy anything um people were saying nobody pays for Content my biggest fear was charging for something and then people calling me a sellout has anyone here had the fear of actually charging for your product just look around it's it's it's a lot of people because you put it all on the line so created this ebook sold it for $495 and to tell you the truth the worst of my fears actually came true let's take a look at a couple of these comments it's from that day RIT I've been a big fan of yours up to now the first thing I suggest to people is to lose the unnecessary subscriptions and yours would be one of those such subscriptions just knifing me in the heart Ben sounds like R figured out how to earn some extra dollars on the side I will teach seems to be more of a product pitch platform now go [ __ ] yourself Ben I've been riding for 3 years never charged the scent and I'm getting comments like this what was fascinating was I kept getting comments like this but quietly over here people were actually buying and they bought 100 then we had 500 s just you know it's a modest number of sales maybe about a thousand in a year but what I learned is those people were way more engaged their email open rates were quadruple the non- buyers and they were just better they were just better students overall so I'm like okay this is a pivotal moment for me I could listen to complaints like this and basically say I'm never going to charge again or I'm going to lower my price I'm going to go to an ad model but I wanted to listen to what the market was telling me and so this this is a pivotal moment in business you get feedback but you don't quite understand what what's going on you have complainers over here and buyers over here so I decided to keep going uh I wrote a book which did pretty well I went on book tour and I asked people what they wanted to hear I came back and I started um learning about product development and building courses and we built this course called earn 1K on the side it's an awesome course any earn 1K students in here awesome look at that um earn 1K we charged $497 so 100 times more this time we still got price complaints people said that's outrageous maybe if it was $14 maybe I would consider it and yet we still had people buying it in fact we noticed that the conversion rate was so high that we actually doubled the price of the course and we never lowered it again so again we're kind of listening to the market what's going on here and then we created a different course later much more high-end this was around $10,000 and for this one more people than ever saw it and we received fewer than five complaints about price so how do you go from a group of people who complain about a $495 cent ebook to a group of people who are delighted to pay tens and tens of thousands of dollars how do you create a community of 30,000 loyal happy customers these are consumers these are people like you and me they're in this room and they are spending thousands of dollars once and then doing it again and again and in fact when they buy their top criter IIA not even their top five criteria is about price that's what I want to talk about today is how do you build that kind of um loyalty and I'm just going to focus on two key decisions the first oh uh before I go on um the thing that I'm most proud of is these students and I'm also proud of our team so you know I'm sort of uncomfortable speaking out here because it's like seems to be very remit focused and I really don't like that we have a term inside the company deifying and I think that's really important so recently started to share photos of our team and share you know different case studies Etc the team is 100% remote they're amazing and they're what makes this possible um these are the things that we prefer to focus on our successful students our readers and our team so the first thing I want to talk about is price so there are two there are two politically correct ways in American culture to say no um let's say your friend invites you to he's having a birthday party he wants to do a scavenger hunt right it's like dude I don't want to go to scavenger hun I'd rather be sitting in bed reading Reddit but I can't really say that so what do you say you say ah man would love to come happy early birthday unfortunately I'm really swamped this week I can't make it I don't have time totally get it we're all busy so time is the first politically correct way of not taking action and the second one of course is price and it's interesting you usually won't see people saying I can't afford that instead they'll say that's outrageous that's too expensive how dare you nobody would ever pay that anybody have this experience it's very interesting um and in fact that's exactly what we see in the data we do a ton of research we collect hundreds and hundreds of thousands of data points this is one we ask people why did you not join our course look at the comments it's too expensive another pivotal moment here the world will try to drag you down in price Silicon Valley will try to drag you down in price and say nobody would pay for that people don't pay for insert blank topic here and if they do they'll only pay five bucks a month well we don't believe that we actually believe that there's there's room in the market to be the best and we mean build the best products um select the best customers and service them in the best way um we have no intention of playing in the $5 $50 $100 Market I'd rather give away our content than play in that market um so how do we do this um the the key Insight I Learned was don't just listen to the first response because that's politically correct that's what they'll tell you but when you build something that is so good it solves such a big burning pain in their life then price is a mere triviality and if you think about it we all this we intuitively know this we all have something in our life that we would pay anything for maybe it's um a business class ticket for your mom to come visit you so she can stretch out her legs right maybe it's a beautiful leather jacket maybe it's a bag of chips you just love these chips whatever we all have something we pay anything for and the same can be true for your products as well so how do you build a product that solves that big of a pain point I just want to walk you through a couple of examples and you can use these in your product development this is a survey and when we start off our product development process um we kick it off we know it's going to take Years cuz we go through the process we test it we run cohorts Etc this is a very very early survey that we would send out and you can notice we're not asking about our product we don't even know what our product is going to be but look at the questions um what would this mean to you paint me a picture of what that would look like tell me how it would make you feel um and then we say here's an example first I'd be able to do X on on on why are we asking questions like this number one we noticed that in product development people especially here are super overly obsessed with quantitative feedback we don't give a [ __ ] about quantitative feedback in the early stages we want to know the stories tell us the emotional stories I came home from work I have two kids I had to hold them both in my hand so I can't crack an egg I need something I can put in the microwave that just works that's interesting um so we ask him and then second you'll notice that we're showing them how to answer questions in the right way I think if you just ask people what do you like to eat they'll be like chow main who cares that doesn't tell us anything so we actually show them how we want them to answer a question and it turns out people are more than happy to answer questions if they know that you're going to be listening okay so that's like the early part of the funnel it's really really open and we're just trying to learn the second part of commanding a high price is your product of course has to be really good so if you are commanding a high price then you can do things that others cannot in we have a course called zero to launch any zero to launch students in here awesome okay so zero to launch helps people create and grow their online business um in many other courses there's a section on copywriting and they have like five ways to write better copy we decided to fly students into New York and rewrite their copy right there on the spot in a full New York video studio just imagine the difference between a $50 value and this course which is you know much more expensive so our competitors are charging $17 $47 $97 one of our bestselling products is $2,000 again reinforcing the point there's room in the market for the best um 98% of our material is free we'd rather not play in that market we just give it away um and the thing I'm most proud of is that we don't accept anyone with credit card debt in our Flagship courses so this is all about your values and I don't believe that if somebody in credit card debt had all the information and motivation to understand interest rates Etc that they would join a multi thousand course so we just tell them no and we tell them use our free stuff come back when you're ready we're going to be here today tomorrow 10 years from now this decision it cost us millions of dollars but I believe it's the right thing to do and it trickles to every part of the Org the customer service is better our metrics are everything's better um so main message on price here if I'd listen to what every told me I would have been sitting you know creating $2 iPhone apps on the side of a road in some ditch I don't want to do that okay I don't want to do that so that's price um the second thing is dealing with rejection who here has felt some sort of rejection in the last 30 days with your business come on don't [ __ ] me everybody does and you know the crazy part is they won't tell you the truth they'll never say uh you spent the last four years of your life building a photo sharing app and the truth is I don't really care if my photos aren't organized they'll never tell you that just be like ah I think the price is a little high remember that $5 ebook I created I had people who were like R love the ebook but I don't trust PayPal but I do trust the US postal service so if you could set up a PO Box I would in fact I'll buy two copies and like naive remit in 2006 I was like okay so I actually set up a PO box and I was like waiting like where's my bushel full of check and over the course of an entire year I received one check for $4.95 don't make my mistakes the thing is they'll never tell you why they'll never tell you why so I want to show you how we handle NOS here's a script I'd like to show it to you this is from a student of ours who applied for a program he was accepted and then he didn't join let me read it to you hi caric I noticed you were interested in testing blah blah blah and you filled out the but you didn't sign up how come the course is closed now but I just wanted to reach out and find out what's up so this is written very intentionally um first people don't like to be told hey you said you were going to do something and then you didn't do it they don't like it but we still want to find the answer to our question um so we did a couple things in this email and we've tested this one we kept it really short two it's super conversational notice the phrases how come or let me know what's up sometimes we say out of curiosity we're not saying you know we're not being super corporate about it and then third we have to be really clear we're not trying to sell in fact the course is now closed we we cannot collect your money we don't want it we get massive responses so if you have had people who are on your email list or in your customer base they have not bought something from you you're sitting on a gold mine the type of answers we get from this are amazing they'll say things like well I'd love to join but you know course looks awesome but I'm in Australia and I can't fly to New York we're like dude it's an online course but that's not their fault it's our fault for not communicating that or we get people who say this course looks amazing but it's really expensive and I can't convince my husband or wife to buy into it that's actually really valuable so now we can add that to our FAQ so we collect these data uh points at every stage of the customer experience before the product in the product if they refund etc etc I can't tell you enough you have to listen to the customer one more insight by the way um this one was a little surprising sometimes I learn that people just aren't ready to buy and that's just the way it goes um like we had people that have been on our list for six years they've seen some of these products be launched like seven 14 times and then one day they'll just buy randomly and I see it come across my dashboard I'm like what is this so I'll email them hey notice you've you know joined finally after 7 years what's up and they're like they'll tell us the most interesting things they'll be like oh well I tried to do it on my own it didn't work so I'm finally ready or oh I paid off my debt or or just because and so my key lesson from that was just to be patient if you've put the right process into place if you've selected the right customers if you've built the best products you have the best marketing our philosophy is it's just a matter of time okay um so the the last point I want to make is what this is all really about um you you don't see this in your Google analytics you don't see this in your AB testing when you're split testing colors or whatever you should do all that you you know you should know your metrics down cold but these are some of our successful students I'm very very proud of them they were able to change their lives and Lead Rich lives um we did this by changing from a transactional relationship to a trusted advisor ship a trust trusted adviser think about it how many people in here have a trusted adviser you can call up and you know no matter what they're going to give you the right information right so surprising there's a lot of people in here as you get older that becomes more and more rare um people get busy they may have an agenda we wanted to be that trusted adviser and sometimes that means telling them no when it's not even in our best interest don't join it's not the right course where you have credit card debt Etc after running this business for 12 years I think I learned I think my beliefs changed um I believe now that the world will always try to get you to be vanilla the world wants you to do everything like them they want you to lower your prices the world will pull you down uh they want you to make your website look like everybody else's easy fast secure and the minute you do it they abandon you the world wants you to look exactly like it and the minute you do it they they will abandon you the second thing I learned is that there is room in the market for the best the the things that we do in product development and growth and customer service and all the groups that we have it's about craftsmanship it's about spending whatever it takes to build the best product um we do test we do ab test we do all of that but taking the time because when we launch something we know that it has to be the best that's how we honor the students who joined our programs um there's room in the market for the best don't ever let the market pull you down you should pull the market up with you okay and the final thing is you're the CEO of your business you decide if you want to run a McDonald's type of business awesome McDonald's is an amazing company if you want to run a Louis Vuitton style type of business where you're focusing on select customers you can do that as well don't ever let anyone pressure you into one decision you are the CEO and you decide thank you very much I think we'll take a few questions over here hey REM um so with the rise of like social entrepreneurship and um you know that kind of build something change the world change people um have you found that you know I want to help you grow rich is becoming outdated at all or have you changed your mind on you know is growing Rich kind of like a Wall Street fat cat kind of like old style mentality or is it still kind of something that is you see from from your customers well first of all I love the question and I hate Wall Street um one of the things that I'm very proud of in my site and my book is I name names so all the books out there tell you about Banks I name names of the best and the worst Banks and I believe that there's incredible trust in someone who you trust actually telling you the best companies and the worst companies and most of Wall Street doesn't like me I will tell you one cool story and I'll answer your question I found out from an internal friend that I'm on a Bank of America influencers list except it's a negative influencers list i' never been prouder I never been prouder um I don't like Bank of America I think I will teach you to be rich um you know I don't know if I would pick the same name today uh I started it out I was focused on Personal Finance but getting up and talking about asset allocation doesn't drive me it's about a rich life so since day one I've always said money is a small but important part of living a rich life um but I certainly think there's many many more important things like for me um relationships Health where I live all those things are way more important so we've tried to redefine what Rich means and I think person by person we are slowly getting there um I hope we are thanks man keep it up thank you hi uh my question is more about lifestyle if you will um so to hustle as all of us do takes time and it takes energy and I'm curious if you have advice for people on how to deal with burnout how to deal with overwhelm how to um have enough brain left to do the thing that they're trying to do even if they have the time excuse me almost every time I hear from someone who asks about overwhelm I and I dig in I found out that there's um almost always an inability to set boundaries almost always and that means being able to say this is what time I'm going to wake up this is what time I'm going to end work this is what I'm going to say yes to and no to the reason that most people never see me speaking at a conference is that I just say no to every single one and I happen to love Sam and I love what everybody's doing with hustle con and I wanted to come out here but I almost never speak um I never do most things that entrepreneurs do because I'd rather take all that time and spend it on our students um the biggest skill I would say in combating overwhelm is developing the skill to set boundaries um every top entrepreneur I've seen is Ironclad about what they're going to do and they want to do and what they're not going to do or they're unwilling to do cool thank you thank you hi REM my name is Jake and I'm I'm a college student so of course I'm trying to to establish myself in certain communities with uh with networking getting to know the right people but but my problem is I don't have the real world experience right now and I was wondering how what what would your opinion be about how I could sort of build up that experience and meet the right people uh in order to see that professional growth great question the fact that you're here means you're ahead of most college students uh I think you should use your secret weapon which is actually being in college um when I was in college I would send out emails every week and I had a tab um that was called failures and if I didn't get enough objections then I knew I wasn't emailing enough people so I started to build a network of emailing CEOs and here's the magic part CEOs will almost always meet a college student because they know how it was and also they want to stay on The Cutting Edge of what young people are doing so you actually have an incredible advantage and I would use that and you just go there and you just basically get their brain dump listen out of 30 minutes I would spend 28 asking questions um so that's one second thing is internships internships or free work um the more you can do that the better your skill set will be the better your relationships will be too all right thank you mate y thank you so you spoke about a parenting course your Mom and Dad aren't getting younger when are you going to be a good son and make them some grandbabies what the hell kind of question is this that's the last question hold on actually speaking of that can I take a picture for my mom and dad they couldn't be here tonight all right one two three oh my God amazing okay thank you guys for that and I'm not going to answer that horrible question thank you for that thanks everybody [Applause]

how many people in the audience are entrepreneurs raise your hand if you're an entrepreneur okay raise your hand if you're an angel investor or investor of some type couple of those okay raise your hand if you just stumbled in here off the street okay that's the rest of you very good all right um so I'm an angel investor and an entrepreneur Sam asked me to come out to hustle con and I said great what format should we use he said well you can give a talk um or you can do Q&A I said let's do Q&A because I like to actually hear what people are struggling with trying to figure out um and uh help them a little bit I get to see um about 500 companies a year in person uh and talk to them about what they're building and I've done that for five years before that I was an entrepreneur myself now I'm an angel investor I've invested in 150 companies I invest in 40 a year I try to be the first money in so um with the cab company I was probably the third or fourth investor Uber um and with Thumbtack I was the second investor so I try to be that first check who believes in you before anybody else when everybody else is doubting you and in fact when I invested in Uber I emailed 20 different VCS um and angel investor friends two of them said yes 18 said no um I was just at a board meeting with one of the people who said no um he is really depressed um I mean like really depressed um he's like I should have just listened to you and I said yeah you should have um I'm a gambler high stakes poker player and I'm a hustler and I believe believe the great entrepreneurs are the ones who can take two nickels now we got two microp okay um my definition of hustle are the people who can take two nickels rub them together and get a dollar of value that's what I see in my portfolio when I meet startups that do really well they tend to figure out better than their competitors and their peers how to get more with less that is the secret now now we've lived in very heady times the last 2 years have been uh what we call in the industry tourist season um everybody comes to Hawaii from December 20th till January 10th and they destroy the island um that's sort of been the tech industry for the last two years and during the dotcom bubble everybody rushes in oh my God I'm going to make an app I'm going to make a billion dollars all the rent goes up you know the office space goes up developer costs go up um but thankfully we're at the end of tourist season the next couple of years are going to be tough they're going to be hard just like it was five or six years ago um and that's actually good for the real entrepreneurs so um it's going to be hard work over the next couple years to be an entrepreneur but you'll have less competitors you'll be able to gain market share and it's going to be back to the sort of New Normal is what I'm seeing so I guess a [Music] question who hi Jason Marisa Harrison a liftoff Communications so I've been around I've launched over a 100 startups had a PR firm in the '90s lucky enough to sell it it's to Omnicom did a few my most recent thing was my own startup didn't an e-commerce startup but now I've come back to the communication framework but much more in a growth marketing sense so the question to you is is what's with the pr haters the um and I'm talking about the I get that we're an engineering driven culture up here but there is a whole lot of um I guess there's a lot of Articles and a lot of there's a sentiment that PR is more fluffy than ever and I'm talking really more about the narrative piece not the getting pressed and I'm just wondering what you think of that and if you can comment yeah it's it's a very good question why do people hate PR yes and PR people by extension um no offense um so as a former journalist I can tell you PR people are super annoying we all know that um they send like the same email to a 100 different people and they don't know who they're emailing and they send a biotech company to somebody who covers mobile and a mobile company to somebody who does medical devices so um but what's happened recently over the last couple years is is um how good a product is is largely determined by the audience and not by PR people and their cozy relationships with journalists so it used to be you had to go through W Mossberg at the Wall Street Journal to get your Gadget anointed um then my last company or two companies ago we launched in gadget and then it became you know you get Walt Mossberg from The Wall Street Journal then Peter Roos from Engadget and so PR was still really good um but today people go to things like wire cutter or Twitter and social media um or to Amazon and they look at the ratings and they pick companies based on how good they are not by these intermediaries so the whole value of PR people was their ability to shape the narrative with journalists and people don't trust journalists anymore people don't listen to journalists anymore there's a huge credibility problem because journalists don't spend much time on stories and at the same time other channel channels opened up like Facebook custom audiences email um and and uh targeting through Twitter and other services Google YouTube and these other channels were much more effective at finding your customers and converting them so the idea of PR people going and you know spending 15K a month on a PR firm you probably would be better off buying clicks or uh acquiring customers with these other platforms so I think PR can work a great PR Company a great example of that would be uh Zillow which had a PR team that went after very local uh markets and the local television stations and the local um newspapers and they did a really good job of providing local data and they did a data play where they really educated local markets and that worked out really well for them but it's a good question okay I'm not allowed to respond however you're talking about the lowest you're speaking to the lowest common denominator of PR people and I'm just wondering why that happens you don't have to answer here because it's kind of like there's bad companies bad VCS bad Angels it's because the majority of PR people are bad next question listen I there are like six PR people who we don't hate like they do a really good job but the majority 98% do a bad job next hey uh my name is Chris I'm working as a developer in the city I had a profound experience using Google's tilt brush the other weekend the 3D painting application and I see that there's huge huge potential I'm wondering what your uh what areas or Industries what opportunities do you see VR having the greatest impact and a way we can get into that space great um so Venture uh virtual reality augmented reality it um this is probably the fifth or sixth time virtual reality was going to change everything the first time was vrml anybody remember vrml okay some old school people here uh gen xers that was virtual reality markup language we were all going to go to Yahoo and click on the directory and click on arts and then go to like photography and then pull out a draw and then pull out anel atom photos and open them up and then people realize that's really stupid um and didn't work because of gpus now we have this incredible device which has gpus that are just demented um and so there is going to be an opportunity I think that this is the time it's not a false start I think sometimes fifth sixth time is a charm if you look at Web video there were hundreds of companies that did Web video and it was wasn't until YouTube um basically used flash syndication and the lowering cost of bandwidth to actually make it free and work so I think it's a similar analogy which is now is the time for VR of course it's $600 for a headset you need a $2,000 computer um so and it's fragmented so you have to be very careful if you're building a startup right now um to not run out of money because there is not going to be enough they not going to be enough consumers to actually make a viable business just like there's not enough Apple watch users yet to make a viable business so that's the opportunities to get in there and learn but you want to keep your burn rate low and experimentation High I was an investor in a company called Riot R yo T that was doing journalism in 3D uh in Virtual spaces uh so they went to Syria and they did this like on the ground journalism it's really really powerful for that it's going to be really powerful for Education obviously adult entertainment and video games are no brainers on the platform um but I do think um AR augmented reality which is when you see the real world and put information out there is also going to be very powerful so perfect thing to invest your time in figure out and have paying clients and actually that company Riot um has done pretty good by having people pay them to create experiences so I would look for customers to underwrite the experiences because when a new technology like this comes out every brand every publication everybody with money is like we have to have a VR strategy go take their money and learn on their nickel it's my best advice get the money hey Jason I'm Brian a big fan of the podcast uh Curious to hear your thoughts uh if you were running Amazon what you would do with Alexa and why I'm addicted to Alexa uh how many people have Alexa oh my God Alexa play Girls Just Want to Have Fun from Spotify that's what I do with my six-year-old daughter every morning Alexa is amazing um I think for those of you that don't have it go buy it like literally get on your phone right now and buy it um it just works and it's an open ecosystem it's everything that series should have been and every week they release new little scripts little recipes that that you can do on it and some of the stuff is obvious like set a timer play music play a podcast but uh It's Quickly going to be on your desktop and I would make it an open API that's on your desktop so you can say Alexa set coffee with Jason at Wrecking Ball coffee at 2 p.m. on Friday and it goes and does it and um talking to computers makes you feel really stupid cuz it never works right you're like Siri do this and she's like no um she's like I can't figure that out and Apple has completely dropped the ball in this regard by making a closed ecosystem um and Amazon is going Android open and it's really starting to work so if you don't have it absolutely buy it it's um it's really going to be trouble for Sonos as well because the amount of time it takes to play something on Sonos is like 40 seconds and the amount of time it takes to play it on Alexa is like 4 seconds now that doesn't seem like a lot until you compound it to hundreds of times a month and that's really when you see a 10x lift like that is when a technology can really have a Major Impact I think Alexa is going to be huge and they're doing everything right with it if you don't have it just buy it it's super cheap I think there's like a $150 version of it now um and it really kicks ass good question hey Jason uh my name is Ben there's yeah how's it going there's a how you doing yeah yeah this is this pretty fun yeah it's a pretty pretty cool theater there's there's definitely Industries where there's regulation that can't be circumvented Healthcare fintech do have any great stories for I say like ways to hustle well let's start with how not to hustle um breaking rules is fun disrupting is fun until you're dealing with people's blood and testing and then making medical decisions so an example of what not to do is to tell people that you can take a pin prick and then tell them what diseases they have because you might go to jail that would be Theros now if there is a law on the books about how many nights a year you can rent your house and how many guests you can have and if you need to be in the building or not and it varies by town to town and City to City well maybe since nobody's being hurt Airbnb can um be a little bit of aggressive in reinterpreting laws reinterpreting laws that might be 10 20 50 100 years old and if you get people on your side in other words you know Uber had customers who really love ride sharing Uber end lft had people who love ride sharing and Airbnb had hosts who would go to City Hall and fight for them um a company like zenitz which had a couple of mistakes they made still a great business full disclosure I'm an investor in that one um but they work in insurance and they created a little script you may have read where you could kind of cheat on getting licensed that's an area where you do not want to hustle Health Care compliance for insurance where people's lives can be deeply impacted now something like ride sharing um and you know housing the laws can be interpreted and it's fine you just really have to be careful because there's some people who are quite humorless in our society and government agencies tend to be one of them especially when more is at stake so if you look at computer crime like literally we could all go across the street kick in a door take the cast register punch the person in the face and get 6 months or 6 weeks in jail where a suspended sentence if you hacked into their computer computer system and took a th000 credit cards to see if you could do it you go to jail for 8 years it turns out because cyber crime scares the public so much you know the the attorney generals really want to make an example of those people the feds you saw what they did to Port Aaron Schwarz rest in peace like they they really were going to like take a kid who stole a bunch of publicly available documents and they were basically pushed him to kill himself because it was just too horrendous to consider going to jail for 10 years be very care F which tiger you poke and be prepared for the repercussions I think this disrupt culture um you know it's fun to think of but um in practice um I would be very careful and you know there's the gray area and if you operate in the gray area and you help consumers people will forgive you so lowering the price of taking a cab allowing more people to rent their homes and make spare income you're kind of on the side of the people when you cheat on an insurance test like the kid from zenefits built that script to do you're kind of like a dick who's trying to make money and cheat and people don't like cheaters and that's a really fine line of like are you working for the people to make the world better or are you cheating to make yourself more money so I would look through the lens of that when you're thinking of when to dance along that little line thanks thanks peace okay how's it going Jason it's going pretty good how you doing good man my name is Austin um what's up man question for you about how you present yourself sort of like to the industry and the market as a whole is one of the things I've noticed is you tend to be more iconic clastic and aren't afraid to step in the middle of controversy or say something unpopular um sometimes that works out sometimes you're right sometimes it's not I'm wondering if that's an intentional thing that you've cultivated and with a with an advantage in mind or if that's just who you are and you've decided to run with it okay it's a good question especially because it's about me um and my personal brand I like that as a narcissist I endorse your question um thank you uh in all seriousness I grew up in Brooklyn my dad's a bartender my mom's a nurse um what's up and um listen I people didn't want me in the industry I had to fight my way in and as a journalist I found that the more blunt and candid I was just like we were on this stoop in Brooklyn when we would talk [ __ ] to each other and we bust each other's balls I got rewarded for that and when you get rewarded for something and being who you are you have a choice when you actually arrive and you get some success and influence you can either say wow you know I got here by being blunt and candid and uh you know what now I'm going to change I'm going to professionalize a little bit and maybe not say Theos is probably a fraud it seems like a fraud to me seems like they handled everything like somebody involved in a fraud would doesn't mean it is a fraud but I kind of my my raadar says this is a just a full-on fraud now I'm very careful how I say that I don't have firstand knowledge it's a fraud but anybody who was doing fraudulent Behavior would act the way they've acted and anybody who had an actual real technology would just show it because it would end all discussion right so I said this on CNBC you know and I say it when I talk I'm kind of blunt and candidate about it at least when people work with me they know what you see is what you get right so I think it's very important to be authentic and who you are and if who you are is your blunt and you're candid yeah sometimes I put my foot in my mouth but most of the time um it it it can irk some people sure but I can also grow on people like a fungus if you will um it's one of my friends told me said God I hated you when I met you and then you grew on me and now I love you I love hanging out with you you I said well thanks jamath um he actually said it on stage but um it's um I think you got to be candid and blunt and the world is full of [ __ ] and our industry is specifically full of a lot of [ __ ] um because here's the thing about Angel Investors and VCS when you meet with them if I tell you I don't you know your business doesn't make sense to me for these reasons and I'm not sure if you're executing at a high enough level as an entrepreneur you actually now respect me cuz I may have helped you by being honest but if you figure it out and you make a bunch of money some VCS think you're going to say well [ __ ] Jason he didn't believe in me in that first thing and he he told me like my product didn't look good and it wasn't designed well so I might lose my ability to get an investment into your company later I found the exact opposite but VCS will never say no they're like let's keep the dialogue open let's keep the dialogue open means I don't believe in you um hey um can you keep me updated on your progress that means I don't believe in you so what I just tell Founders when I meet with them is here's everything I think about your business but before I do that I say you want the red pill you want the blue pill and universally everybody takes the truth pill which I believe is the red pill I think blue pill keeps you in The Matrix and you can start living your delusion that my God you're going to change the world with your shitty design that looks like it was done with Microsoft Paint you know like and and some VCS are like oh my God this has such great potential but I don't want to give you money it's like if you think it has great potential give me money so I just think being candid at all times is a really good strategy for life right and that's sort of the way I try to live my life thank you okay all right that's all the time we have thank all time thank you guys

The League is an exclusive dating app that was started by Amanda Bradford after her horrible experience trying to find someone on the conventional dating apps on the market. 

Bradford's unique marketing tactics helped her acquire a wait-list of over 8,000 people before she even launched the app. 

In this presentation, Bradford goes through the steps she took to grow her daily active user base (DAU), increase engagement on the app, improve retention rate of her users, and create a product that people are dying to tell their friends about.

I love this song it was great thanks guys alright hi everyone I'm Amanda Bradford I'm founder and CEO of the league and today I wanted to talk to you guys about one of my favorite activities which is pre gaming do I have a clicker oh here it is I'm sure a lot of you know about this to you well versed in college and good news it applies after college too so the way I see it is a product launch is basically identical to throwing a kick-ass party and behind every great party is actually a really epic pregame if you don't throw a lot of parties ask your friends that do and I guarantee you they will agree with me this is kind of like the little secret to how to host an awesome party so quickly just give you overview of what I want to talk about today is first is some background on my company the league myself how I define success for a product launch the benefits of pre-gaming of which there are many the art of pre gaming and it is an art the main event itself which is your product launch and then we can do Q&A so quick background what is the league what is the league it's a great question it's changed a lot actually in the last year and a half but you know the league is a dating app it were iOS only and the idea behind the league is for kind of smart intelligent educated people that want to date on kind of ambition and intelligence and not just play hot or not all day so we use Facebook and LinkedIn to double authenticate all of our users this serves two purposes one it lets you see more context about a profile so you're not just making decisions based on looks it also lets you have more privacy so we block you from your LinkedIn coworkers we block you from your LinkedIn connections we block you from your Facebook friends and I really designed that for myself I usually work with a lot of guys in tech and when I did my internship in finance and the last thing I wanted was for them to kind of the deciding yes or no on my dating app profile is pretty awkward so yeah so the social graphs we use from Facebook and LinkedIn let you prevent that and not have any awkward struggles around your coworkers and then on top of that we really curate the community so everybody everybody who signs up goes to a wait list and we keep a very like small engaged community and we pull off the wait list to ensure that the community stays like very high-quality if you have a photo where you're crushing a beer on your forehead you may be on the wait list for a little bit longer um and if you're using fake photos or spammy accounts like we kind of screen all of the noise out that you see on a lot of other dating apps alright so Who am I so I graduated from Stanford Business School and prior to that I had been at Google and Salesforce and a variety of kind of engineering slash sales roles so I got my undergrad at Carnegie Mellon and information systems and graduated knowing that I want to do something in technology so I joined salesforce.com and went to Google went to business school did some internships in business school in venture capital and mobile startups and I think at the at the end of it I I knew I really wanted to do something in entrepreneurship and I study that in in business school and I wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do and I kind of get into it to why I started the league but that's kind of my background so I call myself I want to be tech executive I guess for most of my career and why am i up here talking I think that's a good question you should be asking because there's a lot of people up here that are talking that have achieved a lot more than we have at the league we're still very early-stage we're dealing you know have the same fundraising struggles as many of you guys probably do and but I think why I why I'm up here is that we did a really good job of launching our product from nothing and to gaining brand awareness in a pretty short time and I think our users you know we're really key reason to that and that's sort of why I'm talking here about the pregame and why it was so important and you know mobile apps in general in the consumer space are notoriously very hard to launch it's really you know every day I think there's at least like 30 new dating apps that go live on the App Store it's a very noisy crowded environment and it's really hard to get kind of above the noise and I think we did a really good job at that I'm here to teach you the tricks that I use to do that but I think that's that's why I was invited to speak so I'm excited to share the secrets with you guys so why did I start the league a quick like story about myself a little personal I guess I got out of a five-year relationship in November of my second year of Business School you could say I went on a dating app bender in December I tried pretty much every dating app there is Under the Sun had a lot of the same my complaints on each one I really didn't want my co-workers seeing me I wanted to be able to filter on like intelligence and ambition and it's really hard to do that and I also wanted kind of that same community feeling I had at Stanford where you're in this environment where everyone is super ambitious and they value kind of intelligence and drive and they want that in a relationship and I went on a couple dates in the wild and I realized that kind of being an alpha female and being super career driven isn't always what everybody wants to date and I think I wanted kind of a way to qualify out those people without having to go and you know do a two-hour coffee date to realize that it was a waste of my time and their time so that was kind of the inspiration behind it and you can see here my wireframes that I started and I guess this slide is really just encourage you guys that you don't have to have like VC funding and you don't have to have a technical degree I mean this is I use the balsamic to just mock up what I wanted to build the really MVP functionality and I use my second semester in Business School to do that because in business school your second semester you're not doing much studying so I really focus on this project I did an independent study with one of my professors and you know my goal was to launch it by the end of the by the time I graduated and you know I worked on figuring out how to get it built and I think this is like I guess I want to stop here and just sort of explain a little bit about like why I always encourage people to kind of take the leap a lot of people get stuck in this phase of like okay it's gonna cost me twenty thousand dollars to find a developer like what do I do I need an investor and I always whenever people come and tell me that I say like how much you spend on vacations how much you spend on clothes how much you spend on going out to eat I like boozy dinners and expensive places how much do you spend on ubers and like kind of tally all that up and decide if you know is this is actually like I'm way more exciting investment you not only learn but you also have the opportunity to potentially change your whole career path for maybe twenty thousand dollars of development cost and you think about how much you spend on college I mean it's it's just I guess I always encourage people to reframe the investment and not get sticker shock on kind of investing in your yourself which is essentially what you're doing so I'll get off my soapbox that's just my little motivational speech here um so how did we launch and I like to quote my bro-tastic friend here and say you know we pre gamed harder than a lot of startups party so first I want to talk about what you know what is a successful product launch and how do you define that and you know the definition of a product launch you guys know this is when you turn your product on and people show up and hopefully they stay maybe they spend money but at the end of the day you want them to show up and that's exactly the same thing as a party so you have a party you say it's at 8:00 p.m. at 8:00 p.m. you're there hoping that people will show up it's the same kind of anxiety it's the same prep work you need to do and so when I think about how to explain how to launch a product well I always you know use the analogy of like how would you throw a really awesome large party so what defines what defines a good product launch and the way I think about this is what are my investors ask as soon as we launch our product they ask you how many people showed up how many daily active users you have they ask you what is your engagement like are people interacting are they talking like are people having kind of fun what's your retention are they staying do they check it out and leave because it sucks and what's your K factor that's virality like are people telling friends are they bringing in people and if you think about like a party when you call your friend and tell them to meet you at a party downtown they ask you the same freaking questions they say how many people are there man like I don't know I'm watching house of cards oh is it fun like how fun is it really and then how much longer are you staying by the time if I get up off the couch put clothes on are you even gonna see one you're still going to be there and then who else is there you know are there you know for singles it's often like are there single people there but you want to know that it's a healthy and vibrant party and it's exactly the same as any consumer products so all right so so yes parties are an investment and I think again I think it's like the perfect analogy in a way more fun analogy to think about when you're thinking about how to launch your product so the dirty secret is that you don't even have to have that good of a party you really just need an epic pregame and pre games are awesome because there's no expectations for free games they're really cheap and people just feel special for being able to go to a pre game so it's sort of like you don't even need to spend money on a band or crazy you know food and drinks and open bar you just kind of have a really good pregame so the benefits of pregame I mean are quite a bit so sorry about this guys so why does one attend a pregame you guys notice from college but you know free boost that's one thing that's what I called the value and when you're underage this is really high value right like you would go to almost any pregame if you're 19 you can't get your hands on alcohol and even if the weirdest person across the hall has a pregame you're probably gonna show up so that's that's a kind of part of the value you need to offer then you also get to have input on the playlist on what drinking games you're playing it gets - you get to kind of like define the party and I think as you think about it as like from a beta testing perspective you get to have impact on the features maybe you think the green that they're using is really ugly you could tell the designer that and they might change the green before they launch that's like really exciting for someone to be able to kind of change how the whole party is going you get to have real conversations versus superficial ones you know what parties you're yelling over music asking people like hey what's up but at pre games you can actually find out what you know where that person is from what they're thinking about what they're passionate about you actually get to know people and I like to think of that as like you're you're kind of getting really deep engagement early on you get to arrive at a party with a tribe or a family I think you know you can think about when you're line for the bathroom or you lose your purse you have kind of people that are sort of there for you and and with you and I think you feel like you have a family to depend on and and that makes you stay longer ultimately and then you get to you know at the pre-party you can charge your phone you can put your coat in there in the bedroom even hang it up you get to use a master bathroom like you get this kind of VIP access and so I think these are kind of why as a pre gamer you like going to these and not why a lot of times the pregame is way more fun an actual party because you have all this stuff and then you can take it from the host perspective so if I'm hosting a huge New Year's Eve party why would I like add more work to my plate and host a pregame on top of that like talk about you know more stress right but it's actually way a really really good investment especially if that party is really critical and when it's a product launch it's probably the most critical moment of your company and pre-games I'm sure the number one thing for game to do is this number one point which is they show up and they show up on time so I don't know if any of you have had a party where you tell your friends to show up at 8:00 and they come at 9:30 but that's my friends and I've had a plenty of parties without a pregame and I let me tell you the person that comes right at 8:00 p.m. is not usually your friend is the person you'd lead and you know the least have the least in common with and you're not even sure you remember their name and it's like a really awkward moment and then you come and then you're like where are my friends it's getting you know it's 9:00 let's just party sort of lame so the number one thing that pre games do is ensure that like you have a good crowd there when the party opens up the next thing it does is ensures that you have like high engagement at your party so you have you know your pre gamers have already kind of caught up with each other and now they're ready to meet new people right so they're they're like outgoing they have had a couple drinks they're going to engage with other people and welcome them to the community say hey check out the band back here you know they're gonna be kind of part of your host committee and I think that's really important to have as many people sort of you know welcoming your new kind of strangers to the party as possible pre gamers also feel a lot more commitment to the party so if you think about it if I have you know thirty people over to my apartment I tell them how hard I've worked on this New Year's Eve party how nervous I am about it how I really want everyone to have a good time like your pre gamers feel you and they like okay I'm gonna help her have a really good party and they're committed and even if even if the party is kind of lame they'll stay longer than they should because they're they're there for you they kind of know the whole story and I think that's really important to mitigate kind of mitigate the risk that your party isn't that great and in the last pieces they'll get their friends to join them so I think you know think about this when you're going to a party you know you're gonna be there for hours on a Saturday I don't know about you guys what I call my friends and I say hey come meet me at this party that way I can catch up with my friends and go to the party and sort of kill two birds with one stone so I think as you think about why you know why you want to have a pregame it it really helps to trying to get this core group of users invested so the art of the pregame so this is sort of where I tell you what what we actually did with the league and the first part you need to remember is it's exactly like hosting a party but the secret is there's like zero expectations so it's way cheaper and it's a lot more kind of easy to do on a shoestring budget so you got to do the same the same activities so build an invite list get people to show up and then act cool when they're there so I'll go into like what I mean by that but first this is the probably where you should spend the most amount of time and this is building your invite list and I like to say use the VIP approach this is the least scalable the most time-consuming but also the by far the most effective and this is where you actually are meeting people in person like over the course of months and you're you're putting a face with the name you're telling them about your company but you're not selling them anything you're not pitching you're just getting to know them as people just as like making friends like you're a new person in town I mean it's it's really the same thing you're just sort of building your contacts and then I think the other piece is the lurker socialite piece where you go to these large-scale events and your friends aren't going to keep going with you because you'll need you know you're gonna be going out a lot during this phase and people that aren't building a business don't want to go out five nights a week so you're gonna have to be comfortable going out by yourself talking to people being the kind of weird lurker person that is there and just goes up in strikes up conversations and I think getting confidence with that and being able to do that and not be creepy is you know a skill that is definitely worth gaining and I you know I did that a lot I would go and tell people you know you slip in that you're building something but it's not the focus sation the focus of the conversation is just really getting to know them as people understanding you know how they could potentially be helpful to you in the future but not again not scaring them or pitching them or asking them to sign up for anything you just want to be you know you're basically just building your contacts and then the last piece is door-to-door sales I like to think about this as like when you're a freshman and you want to have a pregame you go around everyone in your dorm and say hey I'm having a pregame in my room at 8:00 do you want to come and you're essentially extending an invitation right and nobody's going to be offended or upset that you are extending them an invitation to an event with door-to-door sales you don't want to just go and be like hey I'm Amanda starting a dating app will you sign up like nobody wants that's nobody wants that knock on their door like don't do that so make sure you're inviting them to something that could add value to their life and you're you're doing it in a way that you're giving them something right you're not asking them for anything you're giving so again this is the most effective approach the next the next approach is the network approach I think you should do this but don't spend too much time on it it doesn't like convert to the super highly so you know definitely email your fraternity brothers and your you know your brother have him emailing his fraternity brothers and Facebook posts and do all that stuff I call that like kind of their digital network but I wouldn't you know don't expect this to be like your golden ticket or anything this is going to get you you know some downloads or some conversions but these are not gonna be your ambassadors and they're not gonna care that much about you so just do it but don't don't expect a lot from it and then I try to avoid that I have no friends approach but this is where you had to make an ad or your Craigslist posting for your pregame and this kind of reeks of like desperation and it's like imagine if you're in college and you saw someone putting in a Craigslist posting for their pregame in their dorm room like you're kind of like man you can't you don't have anyone you could have invited that without you know posting your Craigslist so and it doesn't mean you shouldn't do this ever but I just again like the people you're gonna get from this are usually not the kind of people you want kind of in your core group of ambassadors so the next step is getting people to show up and this is where you actually give them something that they can't get otherwise so what we did like you know think back to college booze was a huge draw that was obviously what you know percent of Hardee's decided to give to get people to show up but I mean there's other things you can do so you can see here we had an MBA happy hour and we didn't even have that much free booze I think I got like ten cases or ten bottles of wine sponsored but the draw here was the MBAs had just graduated and they really wanted to meet each other and nobody had like created an event for them to meet each other so that was what I did I wasn't even about the league it wasn't even about dating or singles or not singles it was just an event for MBAs two minute to meet and we got a ton of people to show up just for that like one thing that we could offer which was connecting with like-minded people from like a similar industry that that wanted to connect anyway I did a girls night where we left a clothing store we left it open and an extra two hours and let people come in and get a discount and so that's another example of kind of offering them some access and exclusive thing that they can't get otherwise we did an open bar so this is the one area we did spend money we spent $3,500 and we did an open bar for two hours and we did require people to have the app downloaded to get in but you know when you're offering them an open bar like that's a pretty good ROI for the person and we're also offering like singles and people like coming were there single people so that was our two drawers but so this was kind of the one where we did sort of ask for for signups and we did check signups but you know we also gave them a pretty good pretty good return on that download you can see here we had a really good turnout this is our Redford party and just to like caveat this this is all before we even launched the product so we had a product in the app store that literally was just like what's your facebook and we got their email address and that's all we did and so everyone like kind of made fun of me because I'm like oh is that the waitlist app like I wasn't open for anyone and it runs like when are you launching that it's been like seven months of parties and so we definitely pregame for a really long time and here's one more trick we used is just giving people free classes so we worked with SoulCycle and Barry's boot camp to have like league specific classes you can see here I got people to come to a you know free these are $30 classes that they got for free because we worked out a deal and then we also got a yacht we rented a yacht for a fleet week which is really again hard thing to get on your set on your own like all the boats are sold out so we had that to get people to go and we actually charged tickets for this party so we didn't even spend any money on it and again these are all just examples of like giving your user something that they can't get otherwise and this is the boat it was really fun party so then the last pieces be cool so don't force them to listen to a sales pitch the worst thing you can do is like make them hear something before you give them alcohol or before you give them you know people to talk to so just just make it a fun party they'll start to associate positive feelings with your brand and with you as a founder and and don't worry about the fact that like nobody downloaded your app but they came to your party like this is part of the sort of pre pre work you need before you start really asking them for things so if you ask too early before you've gained trust it's just it leaves a bad taste in people's mouth so when to in the pregame we've all been to a pregame that doesn't actually go to the party right so you have too much fun or too much alcohol so what we did is we actually put a hard stop in the you know hard line in the sand and said at 250 girls and 250 guys are going to launch our alpha and so you can see here all the pre gaming we did from July to November and we actually put in the APIs screen so that our users knew when we were launching and we're like okay we only need to you know 100 more guys 100 more girls call-to-action for our users who had downloaded it to help us get to that kind of final mile and this also held us accountable so that we actually launched and didn't have too much fun with the pre-party and then so now you're at the main event right so you're actually at the launch launch party and this is where you heard your pre gamers to the party and you say be fun be fun and talk to people and like make this a cool party right so this is where they show up they're highly engaged they're committed and they're inviting other people and this is where the three you know the four metrics you need to be thinking about for your launch always and this is where your product starts to shine right so the party if you're hosting a party it's the party that's shining if you're doing a product launch is where the product shines but you've sort of done all the pre-work now your product is sort of set up for success so it still needs to work it needs to be a good product but you've definitely mitigated a lot of the risk of like launching and having everybody just sort of having a lackluster launch I mean you can see here 419 of our 500 like pre-gaming beta test attended our you know first day when we opened they actually showed up logged in seventy percent message 50 percent invited friends and we didn't even have a launch party so this was all pre funding pre you know we spent thirty five hundred dollars to get essentially on this entire five-month pre-party and then they are ambassadors which I called him now our founding members they really did the rest and they brought in people and the product really grew from there and these small numbers I just wanted to like highlight them because you know four hundred and nineteen people logging in it's not a lot right so it's you don't have to have a million downloads or when you read the like techCrunch's like you just realized that you you can start small and grow you don't have to your launch doesn't have to be a million users so um and then so we actually do this for every city launch you can see our New York launch which we did five months later we had a pre-party and then we had a real party and then to be even more meta this all was actually before our real launch in New York so like the whole parties are actually pre parties so we really believe strongly in pre partying and we ended up launching the next week after that so we launched like May 7th and we had the party April 28th and I really like this method because I think expectations are just lower you're not doing a launch party you're doing a pre parties and people are just getting oriented with the brand and so I really I really feel strongly that the pregame is actually way more important than the party itself so to recap when the party is good everything's good people are inviting people the first experience is awesome and so the way to ensure that the first experience is awesome for people you don't know is make sure you have a pre party for the users you do know and get them really to be your ambassadors and behind every party is an epic pregame so that's sort of like the key takeaway here so now I'm happy to open it up for any Q&A we got to have her two quick questions hi my name is Fallon Austin I'm the founder of trial answer calm and I love this presentation I've never heard the idea of pregame would apply to business I think it's a terrific idea and I was hoping with my specific business you could give me some suggestions it's going to be on online marketplace for copywriters and the copywriters are gonna give you little demonstrations of their writing abilities before you choose them what kind of free exclusive kind of giveaway comes to mind I love the ideas you had but I'm not sure that the bars scenes although bars is always very fun which translate to an online marketplace like mine what do you think so I'm really into building community right so if the copywriters are kind of your your bread and butter these are the people you need for your company to survive right so I think doing whatever kind of they're looking for are they looking to network with other copywriters are they looking to network with people that are gonna pay them I really do I mean you say the bar seems not good I know a couple copywriters that do very well at the bar scene so I do think that just bringing people in person together and offering them maybe it's a copywriter that you you bring in that can talk about how they worked their way up and inspire the more junior copywriters but I I do think in-person events because you just get so much more loyalty from people who know the face behind a brand and it's again it's not scalable at all like you can't do that like we can't even do this in LA already but it's for launching when you're launching from nothing it's so important like I mean if you can talk to 500 people in person before you launch I would HIGHLY encourage it so I would say talk to them ask them what kind of events they want to go to and then create some of these events and they don't need to be expensive like you any bar will tell you oh yeah you're gonna bring 40 people to my bar on a Monday night when I usually make nothing like sure why don't you have the back room so it's it's a very like cheap and easy way to get people and so yeah I would I would kind of go go work with the copywriters and sort of win them over I love it thanks a lot if anyone is interested in drinking with copywriters sign up at trial answer calm and we'll figure out where the event will be how come hi I'm Anna thanks for getting your stories thank you sharing your story question I have is you talk a lot about building a list and then invited them to the party one of the biggest concerns about building a list is those leads going cold before they convert what's your number one strategy stopping that so building a list that's why I try to not build lists so we didn't even use a website for we always had an app in the App Store and for some reason I do I'm a pretty big proponent of like not having people go to a website to log it to get their email address and then asking them later to go to a App Store and download it that's like asking someone for two things so we didn't even start getting collecting email addresses until we had an app in the App Store that could work and that way I only had to ask them once to do it and I could do it when I'm in person and be awkward about and be like hey download this I want to get your opinion on this one onboarding issue we're having so you can almost like arm twist people into downloading it and then they're kind of that yours for life so that's one piece I would say and then as far as keeping them warm I mean you see how many events we had right so we were emailing every month being like we have another cool thing like Redford or come to our fleet week party and so we're always sort of inviting them to things and even if they didn't show up they kind of had a positive association with the brand because we weren't ever asking him for something we were always just inviting them to things and so I think yeah I was worried too I was like five months is a really long time to like keep these people hanging but we tried to really nurture them and always be kind of giving them something every three to four weeks all right Thank You Amanda well thanks guys

[Music] yo what's happening so you're here because you want to see how we are about to spend half a million bucks over the next few months to launch our media company well this is the video of how we're going to do that but just scroll down if you don't want to watch this and read the article it has a lot of the same information so last April my co-founder John and I threw this conference called hustle con the idea was to get 600 people in the room and about 15 Founders who could teach and explain how they start and grew a company even though they didn't know how to code at all John and I had started a company in the past even though we don't know how to code so we thought that this was kind of an interesting topic to address most conferences are actually super lame they seem like one of those things where it's really forced awkward networking really bad coffee in just a bad bad bad time and the worst part is is that a lot of these events cost thousands of dollars to go to and no one actually really wants to be there everyone even leaves early so hosan actually went really well we launched a website in late January and 84 days later on April 24th the event happened in that time we ended up selling about 600 tickets made hundreds of thousands of dollars in revenue and had folks fly in from all over the world to promote the event leading up to it we actually created content every single week these were mostly infographics or articles but they would dive really really deep into how either we did something like found our speakers or how the founders who were speaking how they accomplished whatever they were speaking about afterwards we sent a survey to all the attendees to figure out what they loved what they hated just so we can kind of figure out how to make this better for next year so the feedback was pretty good but one thing that shocked us was that people said that they didn't come because they wanted to hear business tactics on starting and growing a company but they actually came because they wanted to hear stories from these Founders that was pretty shocking because we had spent 12 weeks working on this big event on a very specific topic it turns out people didn't even come because of that reason so we set out just to create a big event but we ended up making a full-fledged Media Company because of the content we created beforehand it worked because most content floating around our Facebook page was a horrible mix of shitty clickbait listicles on BuzzFeed or Upworthy or just completely shallow and meaningless articles that treat their readers like a bunch of morons but with the content we created leading up to the conference and even the talk themselves we realized that we accidentally filled this huge void we knew our readers were intelligent and wanted real indepth relatable stories of people living epic lives but they wanted the stories to have a lot more personality than just a lifeless Wall Street Journal article as we build out this company we're going to be giving tons of updates so you're going to be able to see what's working and what isn't you'll either be able to watch us go broke and starve or if it does work pulling a McDuck and swimming in pools of money so here's what we're about to do we've got about $500,000 in the bank from investors and from our profits from the our last conference we're going to spend all of it over the course of a year to build out this content company in media startup here's how it's going to work we're going to pick a theme a month and then each week we're going to dive deep on a very specific story within that theme I guess it's kind of like a This American Life episode but pulled over 4 weeks instead of 1 hour so that's why we're launching the hustle if you're into this and you're kind of sick of reading all this crap content all over there that's floating around on your Facebook feed just enter your email in the box below and if you really really really like us go ahead and share this on your Facebook [Music] wall swimming through money pits like pulling a McDuck and swimming through pits of money pools of money is it McDuck screw mccrew or duck um wait what that's not whatever I need that wait Rich duck Disney Scrooge McDuck yeah okay

so a lot of people think that hustle means breaking the rules i don't really think that's what it means to me hustle means finding out what the goal is what the rules are and kind of saying screw the rules what's the best way that we can get there using the resources that we have including our creativity that doesn't mean half-assing things or to be sneaky or to be scammy but it means to how can we get from a to b in an ethical way that makes everyone really happy yet we're going to think outside the box and only use what we have that's what hustling means to me hustling is following your passions pursuing what you believe in and getting other people as excited as you are about what you're working on hustling to me is running straight into a brick wall pausing to freak out but then stepping back diagnosing what's wrong fixing that and moving on to the next brick wall for me hustling means finding out the rules of the game that you're playing and how to break them to put things into your favor hustling to me is doing whatever it takes to grow to reach the next order of magnitude hustling to me means finding something you really are passionate about and pursuing it without ever being self-conscious about it hustling means to me is selling other people on your dream and your vision and making them buy into it to me hustling starts with believing that you can from there it's doing whatever it takes to make that true sometimes that's doing something particularly clever and sometimes it's just brutal hard work hustle is really just about endurance hustling is the ability to stretch the dollar as far as it can go hustling is well what i did to raise money for my first company i had no funding i couldn't get any funding but i did have a lot of clothes from j.crew so i looked at the back of the j crew catalog and they said there's unlimited return policy so i boxed everything up i shipped it back to them and they sent me about two thousand dollars that was what i started my business with hustling is something anyone can do you just have to be a little bit crazy to me hustling it's pretty simple just means never giving up hustling is being able to stay true to yourself and believing in you when tons of haters are out there telling you otherwise and being able to wake up every single morning not taking no for an answer that's awesome to me i guess hustling comes down to resilience to me hustling is all about being relentless you

Getaround is a massive idea...so how'd they figure out what steps to get started? If someone wants to go BIG, how should they map out the process? 

Jessica answers these questions in her Hustle Con talk.

Jessica Scorpio is the founder of Getaround, a peer-to-peer car sharing startup. If you need to rent a car by the hour or wanna earn cash on your unused car, use Getaround. Based in San Francisco, Getaround has $43m in funding.

[Music] [Music] So, uh, today I'm going to talk to you about how to turn an O moment into a quickly growing, uh, product market fit company. I hope you've all heard about Get Around, but if you haven't, we're going to be giving out, uh, $50 driving credit to anyone who hasn't tried us. So, um, you'll get to experience it soon, I hope. All right. So, um, we started Get Araround back, uh, in the day at Singularity University, um, in 2009. If you haven't heard about it, it's a phenomenal school. Um, I got the great opportunity to be in the inaugural class with 40 other students. And it's all focused about taking accelerating technology and applying it to humanity's greatest challenges. So, um, back at Singularity, uh, my co-founder Sam was also accepted. So, we packed our bags, we left Canada, and we knew that we were in for big things coming out to Silicon Valley. This was just post recession, and so it was a really cool time to come out here. Um, and then pretty much on the first day, uh, we met Larry Paige who gave us this big challenge. He said, "Okay, Jessica, your your mission here is to come up with an idea that can positively impact a billion people in 10 years." And so, we really took that 10 to the nine challenge to heart. You know, when Larry Pageige says go, you really go hard. And so we did, we jumped in and uh we decided to focus on the global transportation industry. We felt that this was one of the most broken problems that we're facing today. And um the stats are really astounding. So there's a billion cars on the planet that sit idle 22 hours a day. So that's 22 billion idle car hours. It's a pretty much a necessity. Everyone wants or wants access to a car. Um but really in this day, you shouldn't need to own one. So, we really saw an opportunity to um kind of leap towards the self-driving car and to um kind of propel what we helped to foster, which was the sharing economy. Um so, with this problem, you know, um 22 billion car hours idle every day, second biggest household expense, um and cars that are just available for use. Oh big idea. This is a gamecher. And um so we decided to call it car overpopulation. Essentially there's too many cars on the planet. So if you can get cars to be used more efficiently, you can take cars off the road. In fact, each share car takes 10 cars off the road. You could um you know stop cars from being in landfills. You can stop the emissions needed for manufacturing. And um really it seemed like an amazing problem to work on. And so we took kind of a long-term mission around this. Um, we knew it would take us a while to kind of tackle it, but Get Araround, as some of you know and love today, is really a simple concept. It's a marketplace for sharing cars. So, uh, you have cars that are instantly available from your phone by the hour, by the day. You can unlock it, um, and you can drive. Uh, but when we started with Getaround, um, most people that we told about the idea, they said, "That's crazy. It'll never work. um sounds cool, but there's going to be too many hurdles. Don't take that on. But of course, we were really committed. We got this 10 to the nine challenge. And so, we kind of dove in and um you know, we we knew we were going to have a lot of hurdles to overcome. So, I'm going to talk to you guys about that in a minute. But at first, um you know, we wanted to get proof of concept fast. Even though this was a huge idea, we wanted to get it to work on a micro level. And so, we actually took advantage of the fact that we had about 200 um students on campus with us. We had the Singularity University and the International Space University together at Moffett Field. And so we thought, okay, well, let's try to see if we can get a handful of cars and a handful of people that'll share them because really, you know, when you start you have this great idea, the first thing you have to do is you have to go and talk to people and see if people like it or people don't like it if people think it's dumb or if people would use it. And so we went around and a lot of people said, "That's crazy. Why would I share my car with a stranger?" But like any sound you know founder you just ignore that and you keep going right. So we did and um luckily what we did with this small beta or super small alpha is that we saw the people were willing to share. So let me give you the stats around this. We had just 10 cars which you know a small number but 10 people really said I'll share my car with strangers and we had about a hundred people sharing over a one-month period. So with that um we felt like we had enough to go off of that there was something here and to give you the background it was a very uh manual process. So nothing like get around today which is all powered by the app and the hardware technology. It was completely manual. So you had to basically text an owner meet up exchange the keys return the keys at the end of the trip. But still people loved it. They thought I'm stuck. I don't have a car and this is really making my life better. And so we thought we were we thought we were really on to something. So I'm going to sum this up in lesson number one. And I don't know if anyone else has done this, but what I was hoping to do in the time we have left is with our three lessons, I wanted to say them all together so we can kind of lock it in. So let's go to the next lesson. I'll tell you what it is. I'll explain it and then we can kind of say it together and I'll lead you through [Music] it. There. Oops. Okay. Lesson number one is start small, launch big. So, we just talked about this. It's super important to get something working on a micro level before you try to scale it. This applies to a ton of different scenarios. You know, you don't want if you start in one market, you don't want to expand to more markets before you really have it working. Um, you know, you want to really invest in a big launch and if the first launch doesn't work, try again and try again and try to do it in a big way. So, you know, find the right venue, hire the PR firm, you know, do whatever you need to get a big launch, but really have a good story, have users that, you know, just a handful of people that can speak to a positive experience. So, we really felt like this was true with us. Um, our story was that we started small at Singularity and then we worked really hard to get um, insurance, hardware, technology and our iPhone app and everything together and we ended up launching at Techrunch Disrupt about a year and a half later. So, we had to do a lot of work to do that and then we won it and we got thousands of users and over 5,000 people that said they would share their car o overnight. So, that was a huge win for us because everyone said this is a crazy concept. It's never going to work. And then you you launch with this concept of hyper credibility or super credibility where you it's super bunded up. You know, every question someone would ask you have an answer to. You have, you know, top investors or you have top academics on your side kind of um supporting it. And so when you launch big then that's where you can get your um kind of you can get off the ground. You hit the ground running and then you kind of get propelled really quickly. One thing to say about that is that if you start at a really high point, then you're almost always likely to go down. So, it's really hard to keep going up if you start really high. And so, that's a another fun story for another time. But, um, lots more lessons out of there. All right. So, lesson number one is start small, launch big. Let's say it all together. Start small, launch big. Thanks, guys. Great job. I'm really really sorry about my voice, but we're we're doing it. So, all right, let's move on to the next story. So, I already alluded to this a little bit about some of the huge hurdles we had to overcome. I can't tell you how much hustle we had to put into all of these areas and um I'm just glad we did it because it was a lot of fun. So, we um we had to overcome three major hurdles uh just to even get to market. So um the first one was insurance, the second one was legislation and the third one was hardware technology. In a way a lot of this was us taking a long-term um vision on the market opportunity and the um basically wanting to make sure we were launching above board and not in a gray area since it's such a cutting edge disruptive idea. So the the major thing I want to talk about here is how hard we had to work to get an insurance product. So essentially um you you all get the idea for get around. You have people sharing cars. This has never existed before. It's such a basic idea. Why can't you share your car when you're not using it? But the insurance industry doesn't see it that way. So um basically you want insurance. You do what anyone would do. Call an insurance company. Say this is what I need. I'm willing to pay for it. I have money. And then they say no. So, not only do they say no, they say I have no idea what you're talking about and this is never going to happen. And we thought we were set up, you know, we we worked it from every angle. Weworked. We got in with VCs, CEO of the big insurance companies, we looked at commercial insurance companies, we looked at little tiny insurance companies. And so, um, we cold called, we sent like packages in the mail, we did pitches. We did really, really pounded the payment on this one. Um and you know of course you're getting commercial brokers and that broker didn't seem to work out so getting a new one and um at the end of the day we probably were had cold called like 200 insurance companies trying to get insurance and um probably uh you know around the 17th rejection um and we got formal packages responding so people liked us enough people liked us enough to say, "I want to talk to you again in 12 months." So, that was a positive indicator, but we still couldn't even launch our product because we want to have insurance so people feel comfortable and this is all legit. Um, so basically, uh, one one kind of, uh, way we ended up getting it done was to actually pass legislation to make to clarify how the insurance would work. So, basically, it's a simple concept. Um, we ended up passing what's called AB1871 in California and then in a number of other states. So, when you're driving your car as an owner, that's your insurance. When you're renting it out through Getaround, that's Getaround's insurance. Where the insurance companies were all concerned was, well, what happens when there's an accident during a getaround rental? Who's going to cover that? And we said, well, you guys, that's what we're paying you for. And they said, well, that's not clear. So, basically, we passed this law. Then they couldn't ignore us anymore. then they really felt like hey these getaround guys are doing something they're passing laws and so then we uh were able to get um a big partnership with Berkshire Hathaway and since we've had a lot of other insurers approach us um so that was one major hurdle one other thing I want to mention is that we also developed hardware technology in house so um that was a big investment early on and it's ended up paying off a ton um because that's what's enabled us to do a completely on demand, completely seamless product. It took us a few years to develop and um you know we we tested offtheshelf products as well and that's that was a big hurdle but it's been it's now a big asset. Um so one thing I want to say about this lesson is to focus and keep fighting. So if you really believe in something don't give up no matter what and you know just keep pushing really hard, keep trying different angles. I'm sure a lot of you guys have been in a similar situation in your career um where you didn't know how you could get something done. For me personally, getting this insurance was a big win for get around. Uh for me personally, it was an interesting learning where you realize one thing that um we're told and we all know which is think outside the box. So this legislation was a really strong example of that where you know we'd been working as hard as we could trying everything we could try and then it just so happened because I have a political background where it was just like okay well why don't we go on this angle and it it happened to just make all the difference. So don't forget to think outside the box if um you know you're really stuck on a problem. And yeah, so the lesson here is to focus and keep fighting because that really paid off for us. And you know, we focus on a few key hurdles and then of course we focus on other hurdles later on. Uh keep fighting for what you believe in. So let's uh lock this one in together guys. Focus and keep fighting. Awesome. Thanks. All right. So moving on to the a little bit more of our story. I already told you guys how we launched at Techrunch Disrupt. This was an amazing honor and a and a ton of fun, especially to go from this crazy idea to, you know, a very hot startup that a lot of people believed in. I think we were the first company ever to win both the grand prize and the audience choice award, which was kind of fun. Um I think the story here is actually um about how we had this big vision for enabling people everywhere to share cars. And we actually had the vision very very early on that it was going to be a mobile first product and that you know you could unlock the car from your phone. And then when we when we launched we decided okay well we want this to be kind of possible anywhere. So we actually decided to start without requiring the hardware and early on we thought it was very important to allow owners to specifically accept and request um people they wanted to share with and specific times they wanted to share. So early on we made the product very owner owner focused with a lot of owner control. And um the reason this lesson is all about failing fast and listening is that um we weren't achieving the objectives we weren't we weren't getting the growth we wanted. Uh we weren't you know we were hearing feedback that people loved it but they couldn't get a car as often as they wanted. And I think there's there's definitely uh the gold standard now in transportation around you know having a car just pick you up. And now with getar around, you can just get a car and whenever and wherever you need it. Uh but early on it wasn't that easy. So we kind of had a realization that we weren't achieving our vision for get around um in terms of it being extremely convenient and easy. And so we we kind of we after launching tech disrup we raised our series A and we were kind of off to the races rolling out to new markets developing products hiring people. But then we still had this kind of lurking feeling that maybe we didn't have product market fit. Maybe it wasn't quite there. It was working enough, but was it really the right um thing to scale with? And so um here's a second slide to this here. So when we announced our series A, we decided to um roll out a new product called Getaway, which was kind of an answer to figure out how could we get more reliable supply out there. So for you any of you guys in the audience doing marketplaces, you know all about supply and demand. Supply is always a growth driver. It's harder to get typically. So if you figure out how to get more supply, it's very beneficial to the healthiness of the marketplace. Um so yeah, get away um was we basically wanted to figure out how can we make the experience better and one thing we tried was to um manage cars for people. So a lot of people were approaching us and saying, "Hey, I love what you're doing. I live in, you know, Nevada and I'm going abroad for a year. Can I give you guys my car? I'd love for it to be part of your, you know, car sharing revolution. And so we thought for for a little while we were turning those people away. And we said, no, we got to be focused on the business we're running here. But then we realized that um this might be a good opportunity to test different product features we have in mind. And so we announced this and a lot more people with similar stories, you know, living abroad, uh, working abroad, traveling came to us. And so we ended up having a pretty cool fleet of 50 cars very quickly. And we kind of we kind of shut it off there. We had lots more people that wanted to give it to us. We also had people, which um is also a positive indicator for any marketplace business, is around in kind of power power users or uh investors. So we had a bunch of people wanting to give us cars to manage that they just counted as investment vehicles, literally investment vehicles. Um so what's cool here is it was really a learning for where we wanted the product to go. Um and we started getting the type of growth that we until this date hadn't really um even had only really heard of. So, um, very quickly we got to, um, 600 instant cars. Um, and we had a million rental hours and then we had we were booking 100,000 hours a month. Um, and so this came from taking the learnings from Getaway um, and deciding to open it up to the broader platform. And eventually what we've done today is we only allow the ondemand option. So, um, the real story I have to tell you here is, uh, about deciding to kill certain products. So, we launched Getaway. It worked really well, but we decided that, um, we didn't want to be in the business of managing cars. So, we weren't, you know, we didn't set out to become a rental car operator where, you know, we had lots and we had thousands of cars or tens of thousands of cars or millions of cars that we're managing. So, um, we actually had to we we ended up killing Getaway and we've always been very open with our community and so they they understood it. We had to develop a lot of product features to set up for the on demand model like screening users quicker and um having better calendar management and having kind of all kinds of different little mechanisms in the experience that would make it possible. Um but basically by killing getaway and then most recently killing off request it's been amazing uh way to focus the product and also um just be able to sell an experience that um people want. So previously people would ask you know how does it work and when you have three different product experiences you know you can't get into specifics but now how it works is extremely easy and extremely simple. Um but you know in that in that um change we we shut down specific markets. We had to make a lot of changes and so over time your strategy changes but I think the most important thing is I should get into the lesson side. Uh lesson number three is to make bold choices. So we've learned a ton from this. Um being bold has like really carried us a long way. being bold enough to test Getaway even though it was going to cost us a lot of work and we had to do a lot of things manually to support it you know then killing it then rolling out um on demand to the whole marketplace then convincing originally when we rolled that out owners were used to the control so they said hey I don't know about this but we got 20 people who said they'd try it and then on instant the owners were making so much more money that they were just screaming from the rooftops like this is amazing get on board I love it. And so they became great champions for kind of the new model. And um eventually then you know then you just say this is the only way and if you lose 10% of people then you just take that loss because it's better for everyone. Um so yeah make bold choices. Uh let's lock it in guys. Make bold choices. All right. So get around today. I was supposed to give you a bit of an update at the beginning but I'll just go into it all now. So here's some of our lovely team. Um we are 80 people today. We've raised over $40 million from top investors. Um we are here in San Francisco um in Soma. Um growing a ton. We have over a thousand instant cars. Um and we have 250,000 users and uh we're growing expanding out to various cities now. So uh we're in the most of the Bay Area. We're in Portland. We're in Washington DC and we're launching a few major East Coast markets. uh this year. So getting excited about that. We are hiring um so check out our jobs page if you're interested or tweet at me and talk to me. Um and I hope you guys have learned um some interesting stuff from this talk. I like to try to end a little bit early so we have more time for questions. Okay, so a couple questions actually. First curious if you've ever looked at the aviation market in addition to cars and second what all went into getting AB 1871 passed. Uh so a lot of people have approached us to do different verticals. It was actually a focus kind of um priority to just focus on cars. We thought the opportunity was big enough and um we you know in the future we have big goals. We want to be global and you know be available everywhere but we were focused on cars. So I know there are a couple aviation startups. I don't know them off the top of my head but not that many people are doing it. Um people are doing boats basically. I think yeah I'm a new pilot and the industry is in decline. Oh yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well they're big assets. It's just for us cars are can be um you can use it more frequently and it's um basically uh there's a lot more of them so it's a more mass market opportunity I think but yeah there there are a couple um so what all did you have to do yeah to get maybe 1871 um so yeah we actually partnered with incumbents in the industry in a sense competitors to work on that um we I mean it's it's kind of a process but you just kind of pitch people on the hill and then you kind of work with someone to write the law and then lobby legislators or uh I'm not officially a lobbyist. You can't officially do that. Yeah, good question. Thanks. All right, come on up, guys. We have a little bit of time. Hi, thank you for talking despite being sick. No problem. Um I'm curious how getaround differs from other car share platforms um like car to go or zip car. Yeah, great question. Really great question. Now like I said, now that the product's streamlined, I can answer that very clearly. So um basically Getaround is quite similar in a way to those services and that you can rent cars by the hour or day. In general, um we have a very broad variety of cars. We have a lot more locations. we hear that they're, you know, in some building or on their block or in someone's driveway. Um, so the the car variety can vary quite well from anywhere from Teslas to Audi R8s to Priuses or Mini Coopers or pickup trucks. Um, we also don't charge any membership fees. So, um, you know, it's we've lowered all the barriers to trying the service and entering it. Me personally, when I came out to the Bay Area, I looked at the signup fees and I thought, I don't know how long I'm going to be here, so I never signed up. So, we want anyone who comes to be able to try it because as soon as you try car sharing, your your whole perspective around cars and car ownership changes. Uh, as well, I think we're a lot more scalable and it the the big thing is the money goes to people who own cars. So, it's really giving it. We obviously make a business out of it, too, and we get a cut, but the money goes to helping your neighbors keep their cars and, you know, do things they want to be doing. Thank you. Thanks. Last question. Just wanted to ask you quickly about intellectual property and your intellectual property strategy. Great question. Um, like I said at the beginning, we kind of took a long-term view on the opportunity. Um and we worked on passing or sorry in the political brain right now uh filing a lot of patents in our early days and as well as trademarks. So um luckily we have a pretty techsavvy team that has done that for both um business patents and also kind of the technical all cir from the hardware to the whole uh experience. All right, thanks guys. Have a great day.

In this Hustle Con talk, Arum Kang, the founder of Coffee Meets Bagel, explains how to build your first tech company without a technical co-founder. 

Arum, along with her two sisters, is the founder of Coffee Meets Bagel, an immensely popular dating app. Prior to CMB, she worked at Avon Products and Amazon, leading efforts to understand consumer needs and behavior. She is a proud graduate of Harvard Business School.

CMB has $11m in funding and recently denied a $30m acquisition offer from Mark Cuban while on Shark Tank (kind of).

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

[Music] [Music] hi guys so great to see so many Hustlers okay so I'm super excited to be here and typically when I go to conferences I really appreciate speakers who can share real stories and also uh give some technical things that I can get started on right away so hopefully I will be able to do both of those for you today so let's start by talking a little bit about myself so you know who you're listening to um I moved to the US when I was in high school from Korea so I heard from Sam that today there are representations from five continents in the audience which is pretty cool hopefully there's some representations from Korea my background is in business I went to business school and I've always been in the consumer products industry I love absolutely love uh working on products that I know will end up in hands of customers especially if it's something that they can engage with on a daily basis like coffee me bagel so today I'm here to tell you and talk a little bit about my story and how I started a tech company without a technical co-founder and the short advice is if you can get one go get one because it'll make your life lot easier uh but you know not everybody has that option I didn't have one and it certainly should not stop anyone from starting or at least getting started so I want to talk first about the story behind coffee Meats Bagel how and why I got started and how I built my first minimum viable product without any Tech technical knowledge and then finally how I found my CTO so when you talk to anyone about dating in general not just even online dating you probably never find anyone who's like 100% satisfied with the dating scene like there's always some problem and some complaint and that's because dating is really hard you know getting two people to fall in love is is a is a big challenge um for me online dating in particular had three main problems one it's optimized for men so if you look at what I mean by that is if you look at vast majority of online dating products it's optimized for surfacing as many photos as possible and men really enjoy browsing photos of women like they genuinely enjoy that you know it's not a bad thing right and most products uh that are out there are designed by men but on the other hand women don't particularly enjoy browsing through endless photos of men I in fact you know I think more often than not we enjoy browsing photos of other women uh than men so so that's a big problem obviously not only that women get harassed often you know you you put a picture of that has any like remote resemblance to woman's face or woman's body I guess it won't take you long uh before you you start getting like creepy messages from creepy people and then finally online dating is a chore let's face it right like you don't ever run into anyone who's so excited like I can't wait to try this online dating platform like looking so forward to it no it's still something that people kind of just do it because you know okay I kind of should meet somebody it's hard to meet somebody because I'm so busy let's just give this to try so how do you make this more exciting how do you bring exciting back to dating because it's should be a very it's an exciting thing right meeting somebody for the first time and how do we deliver on traits that focuses on quality safety and simplicity which are traits that are especially important to women so our solution to this was creating one match a day every day at noon and giving our customers something to look forward to creating that magical moment on a daily basis that's how you bring excitement so we we do we curate uh the matches and we use variety of information mainly at Coffee mbago um it's very important that we actually make matches through your friend Network so somebody close to your network which also creates environment uh and the sense of safety so now that I have this idea but no one to help me build this like how did I go about it when I first started this sort of Journey um the first advice and the best advice I got was this is from a friend so I blurred out the name but it says this guy looks pretty good good work experience School a is definitely not as well ranked as school B but it's fine I feel you don't necessarily need a super good guy as there's nothing very hard technically about this concept if you get traction then you can hire great people as they will want to come and work for you but for now you can save your cash I feel it's more important that you validate the concept fast and for that you need someone who can work full-time to get a prototype out fast so for my first engineer I didn't look for Stanford MIT grad I I just wanted somebody Who had who was capable of building something very simple my minimum viable product and who was available I mean lots of people are busy doing lots of things and my MVP consisted of four things one it was going to be simple Facebook app to get information from Facebook account because I knew the product for this product was getting access to the social graph was very important second thing it had to have basic functionality where you can see a profile and like or pass and then basic admin tools for me to actually create these matches and finally uh we needed an ability for people to Anonymous anonymously chat um on Anonymous phone number so that if there's a mutual like they can actually talk to each other and so it's pretty I mean it's not that simple I mean there's still some complicated elements here but it's enough for me to actually prove out variety of hypothesis I had like are people willing to give me Facebook access are people going to be chatting uh are people willing to give me phone number and are they going to be chatting Etc so these are some designs initial designs um like Sam mentioned my co-founders are my sisters and one of them is a designer so I had that area covered so these are some initial designs I had um this you know a lot of things were imported through Facebook this profile where you can set up preferences and then pictures I mean it's not the most sophisticated designs where you can input phone number and then finally where you can like or pass if you take a look at this you can already tell there's lot more in in terms of features here than the MVP that I stated so this is very common mistake that lots of people make and that I made also and we ended up whittling down a lot of things um you really want to stick to the bare minimum things that you need and I think it's very easy to feel like oh my God I really need that feature when in reality you don't really need it and I've I I see now a lot of companies they use Google forms or even surveys without even building anything to get started so that's something definitely important to remember so once that I had concept my first developer I hired from odesk I had a friend who was a python engineer who told me about odesk and recommended that I use Python because I guess that's what he was familiar with and he liked I don't think there was any particular reason um and he also was the one who you know suggested that I create a g GitHub account so whoever I whoever I hire can actually submit and checking code um so I chose Python and got a ton of responses from odesk that's what happens if you put anything on on on that platform and so it was really hard for me to tell who was better like just even looking at ratings and reviews so I needed something additional to be able to evaluate so I started with the small project I actually gave project to them it was very simple and I asked three questions how long do you need to implement this what questions would you ask me to clarify the project and can you answer my question in the doc I had some questions and I was super surprised at the variety of answers I got I mean it varied from like 2 hours to 40 hours no questions to like a lot of questions Etc and this really gave me good insights even though I don't I can't fully vet out them technically but it really gave me good insight into how experience they were and so this is an initial posting that I used it says expert python Jango engineer for website with Facebook integration needed and if you see the posting I mean I explain I me introduce the team a little bit it looks like a real job you know job posting right this is how you also um attract better candidates even on odesk and this is uh the the initial project that I gave it was a one page basically asked them to hey create something an app where you can log in with Facebook collect specific information and then have a sign up page and I didn't provide any mockups and there are some parts that are left purposely uh vague because I I wanted to see if this is a type of person if there's ambiguity are they going to bring it up to me and discuss okay hey this is not very clear let's clarify this or is this the type of person who's going to just kind of go off and make assumptions and everything and then two weeks later come back with something I you know didn't really expect and so this was a very good exercise and I was able to hire an engineer from um Indonesia who I paid $15 an hour and I think for the MVP it took him about working about four weeks uh and he dedicated about 15 hours a week so not bad right so once I had the MVP I had 50 of my friends actually sign up and and their friends too uh single friends and sign up and actually test this um obviously just singles and I was the one who was curating match every day uh doing the Matchmaker thing and at noon I was you know the one who was manually sending emails I was using MailChimp and I tested this for a week and the result was very positive you know vast majority of the users were logging in every day and I also after a week followed up with most of the users by phone to get some qualitative feedback and it was very positive and and the overall response was you know they really looked forward to getting the email at noon time clickthrough was very high so I would call that a success right so I was ready to get this you know MVP into a full-blown product and then something terrible happened to me I lost touch with my engineer and he disappeared out of the Earth so I had this code that I didn't understand and I couldn't get in touch with him and so that leads me to my final section how I found my CTO so the problem with odesk it's not lack of talent there are lot of great developers it's lack of commitment and consistency a lot of these contractors work for multiple clients at a time so if something happens with one project they may not have you know all that time to dedicate to your project and I was paying this person on an hourly basis so there is no repercussion if he just you know takes off and leaves and so I would suggest uh in terms of incentive structure some combination of hourly as well as a lome payment upon delivery of the project I don't think it's a good idea to just do it on Project basis because one you may not attract the best people out there and two I think if you know the engineer ends up underestimating the hours which they often do they may end up cutting Corners you know because they don't want to put a lot more hour hours to it so some combination is what I would recommend but you know regardless I needed to find a local developer my CTO and the key to finding CTO is I mean I guess there's no shortcut here it's basically using your resource to go after every channel possible I mean I went after meetups Craiglist Friends School list people are often surprised when I tell them I found my first you knowers two through Craigslist but you know there it's still very effective Channel um I found my second one through Meetup list I sent out a Meetup email to to a Meetup um python Meetup in New York and that's how I found my second one but it took a while I mean this kind of conversation takes time obviously the timing has to work out so I I think for my second CTO I started conversation with him in July and then we didn't end up working together until January so keep those conversations going this is the the Craigslist posting that I had you know fell in love with python Great Python Shango developer needed at a new online dating company full-time or part-time with potential CTO opportunity notice I didn't advertise specifically for CTO position because I didn't want to set that expectation it was very important for me to First work with this person together and then together coming to a decision is this C position the right job for for you and then this is my email to the New York python Meetup Group advice needed where is the best place to find a python programmer and this is where I got the response but now you have a you know somebody that you like to work with but how do you hire them when you have no money because I didn't I hadn't raised any money at that point and typical market rate in New York at the time was you know if you want to hire any good enough engineer you have to pay upwards of $100 100 to maybe $150 an hour so this is what I suggested I'm going to pay you $30 an hour and you can build me every two weeks I'll pay that we'll work together for six months and if we mutually decide that this is the right job for you then we'll talk about Equity compensation and then if it doesn't work out then I'll pay you the difference a few months later we said October at the time and the the discussion happened in January and my thought was okay there's still a risk if things don't work out I would have to pay you for that amount but if things work out I would have raised at least some money by then so it bought me some time and I could conserve my cash one thing I want to say about generally CTO is I I've ran into so many CTO who are working on really early stage products that obviously they came on board but six months to a year later they're not happy because they feel like um they didn't get compensated fairly in terms of equity because founder share versus the C share is often times very different the difference is really wide and if you think about it if you brought somebody prefunding and they have to go through just as much uncertainty and risk as you do you know think of put yourself in their situation and think like what is the fair amount that that they'll want so that they don't have to worry about this kind of stuff and actually dedicate to work right because the last thing you want to do is get somebody on board because that takes time and then a year later they're resentful and then they are thinking of leaving and so I think oftentimes like investors investors will tell you okay this is the fair amount or you might read something on Tech runch or whatever this is fair amount but I think you should personally think about what you think is fair to give out to your CTO but you know at the end of the day it may still not work out so my two CTO initially it did didn't work out with them for varet variety of reasons you know personality or whatever location didn't work out so the last message I want to give you is you need to take your time before committing to each other um I was lucky my third one we uh met actually through a recruiter uh by that time I had raised some money um so I could actually work with the recruiter and then it was a great match so now you know it's been amazing but I made those two mistakes and it was great that I didn't commit anything yet right so with that summary of my talk one you don't always need an a player to get things started don't wait for that genius who's going to come in and solve all your Tech problems because they don't exist get it out there build it and iterate get a tech advisor and this doesn't have to be anyone official in any sense right I I talked about my friend all they need is to spend maybe five to 10 minutes a month they don't even have to meet you in person you can you know just shoot them an email take five minutes like hey what do you think about this resume or do you think this coat snippet is clean it's not much time for them but it's very valuable for you again there is no shortcut you have to work at it and it takes time and one way to to help with that is being creative even now I love recruiting outside of the valley because in the valley things are just so competitive and people aren't as willing to take risk with someone you know who may not have all the you know hot startups in their resume um Etc it takes more risk and more time to get out there and recruit so it's less competitive so be creative and then finally take your time before committing it's very important thank you very much for your time I hope it was helpful thank thanks arum if you have any questions for her please come up hey so I was wondering uh how do you deal with computer security throughout the entire ordeal the possibility of someone hacking into the site when you are in development yeah to be honest that was not in my mind when I was so you just got lucky essentially yes okay I guess hey thanks for your time it was very down to earth I love it you know thank connecting um question for you is coming in with no money and you have all these potential CTO how do you enter into your legal agreements to protect yourself uh with without having to spend money um like with a legal company and all that yeah that's a really good question the way I did it which may or may not be the right thing to do is we actually wrote something down just very casually using our own words no lawyer involved uh that stated some of these core things that we agreed on and I think by that point if you need already if you need a lawyer I I don't think that's the right person because yeah I understand you need to protect the downside but when you're that early and you're trying to be Scrappy somebody who's asking for a lawyer and a contract Etc I don't necessarily think it's the right fit so it honestly didn't occur to me it didn't occur to him and I think anyone who's willing to try out at a startup like that early shouldn't want to involve a lawyer thank you yeah hi uh so thanks for sharing your story it's pretty pretty awesome to hear um really love to get a little more detail on that getting that first CTO yeah $30 an hour seems so cheap um rates you pay like on code Mentor I owe are like easily $100 an hour for a really great engineer yeah so I imagine the equity incentive has to really be strong or at least the I mean I don't know what the contract you actually ined out with this guy or your first CTO are but to get a CTO fulltime like if anyone of any talent in the United States for $30 an hour I imagine you must have given them a really strong Equity incentive if it worked out yeah so um to be clear when I actually drafted this contract we didn't have like okay your equity share is going to be this percentage Yeah and I think there's pros and cons to having that conversations early versus later yeah um early obviously gives you Clarity but I think when you have that conversation early and then this is this is sort of how like six months later people feel a little bit resentful or something because I feel like I'm pulling more weight and so we need to reopen this conversation Etc know for me um B basically I was willing to give founder level Equity it wasn't it wasn't going to be equal split but okay uh it was very significant yeah and I typically like to share this like anyone who ask about this I think at the beginning if you want to really attract the right Talent you need to be generous with your Equity like you can't be stingy about it because this is a person who's going to dedicate just as much time and energy with you and try to ride all the roller coaster ride with you so even now my current CTO I mean he's almost a CO you know fourth co-founder to me okay in terms of commitment and every in every sense um and so I never felt like oh my God I'm giving up too much okay yeah um any other learnings here so I've a lot of people say you know co-founder should be within your network or you know it should be a technical person that you know um so I think hiring somebody from craigsl or what not seems a little daunting because you just have no relationship with this person and it seems so Random yeah um so any other learnings you can share like if you know you have to go that route um you know anything else you kind of learned along the way yeah so what I would like things that I didn't do that I would do now is definitely reference checks um I find that really funny here like sometimes if I ask for references or like a project or something because I guess the market is so competitive itive people like my recruiter would tell me oh you know if you do that you may turn off some people and they may not want to apply or whatever but if you don't even want to go through that like I mean forget it then right so I I think reference tracks are really I take even now for every employee that I bring I take that very seriously I even do reference checks before I bring anyone on site um and it's not just like formal okay I'm just doing this to check off the box I really drill down to it because that is one of the most important data point you can get about the person I've turned down a lot of actually opportunities where we almost you know people were like excited about this person and then because of reference we didn't end up hiring okay yeah awesome thank you thank you okay we're GNA take these three hey arum uh thanks for the talk uh so mine I'm running a really early stage startup and looking for a CTO if anyone in the crowd is interested come talk to me so Scrappy so uh my MVP is a little bit more complicated and what I'm looking for in a CTO is not just someone who's a developer but also someone I can bounce ideas off of and really learn and you know design the product along with them so when you initially said you found a CTO or a developer in Indonesia um is that even possible and do you suggest waiting to find someone like that over here where you can have that real-time conversation uh rather than find someone internationally and then you have the time delays and you're not able to have that uh that depth of thought yeah I mean the the Indonesia person I wouldn't call him my CTO he was a contractor that I was working with I would challenge your thought about whether your MVPs really needs to be more complicated because it's a really hard exercise I think you have to go through over and over and over and every time you go through that exercise you'll find something that you can simplify and so yes it's important to get a technical co-founder I mean technical partner who can you can bounce off ideas and all that stuff and typically like all the engineers that I've met who want to join a startup are people like that you know they don't want to be just coding right they want to get their ideas heard they're very product Savvy also so I think you'll have no problem finding uh that person you know here who will you will be able to talk about product as well as coding Etc um yeah I would say it's going to be a little hard harder to do that finding that person abroad like you know through odesk or something but that shouldn't stop you again from getting started it's always much easier to attract the right partner if you already have something to show them right so consider that some investment that you're actually doing in order to hire better people yeah right great thank you thank you arum and guys once again look out for me what product you oh no no worries thank you for the talk yeah thanks for um you had mentioned that other online dating platforms were not as great um what other apps or products did you use as mental models when you started out I mean I've tried I mean I've tried everything and I've still used everything right ok QB . um all the mobile apps I think at the time there was like at the pool there's so many that come in and out all the time that I can't even get like keep track to be honest but I use even now I use Tinder everything to get product Inspirations just to see what other competitors are doing does that answer your question yeah I guess just in addition to online dating sites what other products oh yeah yeah yeah so I actually use now I use a lot of games gaming products for inspiration because our business model is also very similar to that of mobile games and I absolutely love how a lot of mobile game products um are able to really C Service customers well they they provide personalized services and really incentivize the users to engage consistently with the app um so I usually get a lot of good ideas from just playing Gam games cool yeah thanks uh thanks for the talk uh what what range do you consider founder level Equity is it like 5% 15 I'm just curious like 20% well so if you were to start a company today with three people I would think you would split it 33 3 like 1/3 1/3 1/3 right and so if this person is joining maybe it's not onethird I'm depending also again where the stage is at but maybe it's 15 maybe it's 20 I mean if it's really early whatever right so it's definitely I think 5% to be honest I hear 5% a lot I think that's too low if you're postf funding that's a different story so when I say founder level just really think about okay if I were had started this company with this person from the very beginning what would the equity split had look like I think that should give you a good guidance got it and and you were able to raise funding um without the co-founder and without the CTO so when I raised money my initial fund um seed we raised $600,000 I had the second CTO but we were still on this hourly structure we hadn't had like clear okay you're going to come in as a CTO after I raised money uh we had conversations we were still working maybe a few months and then we decided okay this is not a good fit for both of us yeah so then my Curren C to came on board after the seed round funding okay I got it thanks great thank you thank you guys

At Hustle Con, Tim explained how he went from $400k in debt to starting Pandora (even though he can’t code). Make sure to check out the part where Tim gives the pitch he used to convince 50 employees to work for free for two years. 

Tim Westergren is the founder of Pandora. I'm not gonna tell you what Pandora is because you already know. But did you know they have 81m monthly users, $900m a year in revenue, and 1,500 employees? Or that Tim was so broke the first two years that he couldn't pay his staff? Talk about hustle…

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

[Music] thank you I really enjoyed Walker's comments I would take that all to heart that's a really good good information for you so I'm just going to tell you kind of the quick story of Pandora the circuitous path we took to get here and maybe in sort of our experience there might be things that you will find interesting or helpful in your own journeys I can just sense the entrepreneurial energy in this room when I was walking through the lobby on the way and it was like humming it's really fun to be around so I went to to school Stanford I was I'm gonna grad there and I studied Poli Sci which is Stanford's shortest major which allowed me to do a lot of different things as an undergrad and I have had a lifelong passion for music and it really burgeoned when I was in college and when I graduated I knew I wanted to be involved with music in some capacity I didn't really know how how I was gonna make a living at it and I was completely unprepared for any kind of job given my Poli Sci degree so hunted around and found up getting a job as a nanny that's a respectable profession actually mani is the proper term for that and I was a mani for the first five years after school that was my job it's not really what my parents expected when I graduated college but kids are my other lifelong passion so for the first five years after school of my life consisted of getting up in the morning sitting down at the piano and playing piano till about 1:00 or 2:00 in the afternoon and then going to pick up these two kids nine ten-year-old boys at elementary school taking them home and hanging out in the afternoon playing wiffle ball on the street with a bunch of kids and making sure they did their homework I've been cooking dinner for the family and then coming home getting back on the piano and playing so I went to bed so I was playing piano 810 hours a day and then hanging out with kids pretty good life did that for a while and then wound up getting involved in rock bands it's been about seven eight years living out of a van being sort of part of this huge sea of I think a lot of talented but completely invisible working musicians and eventually kind of grew tired of that and then wound up a film go film composer writing music for picture started with sort of small short student films and kind of gradually worked my way into doing sort of independent feature films it took a few years so I was coming this winding road and and over the course of that experience as a musician a bunch of ideas began to kind of accumulate in my head one was of course all this undiscovered incredible music that I'd experienced was seen as a musician and then as a film composer my job as a composer really first and foremost is to figure out the taste of a film director and the way we would do that and I developed sort of methodologies I would sit with a director and we would actually watch a the completed locked picture with sound effects and dialogue but no music on it and I would bring with me a stack of CDs and I would play songs for them and we would talk about the music and it was sort of give me their feedback to it and I would use that musical interview kind of like a musical myers-briggs test to sort of glean from them what they wanted in the score for their films I'd go back and compose something so I developed a musical logical profile of their taste and I did this for a few years and and and then one day I read an article a newspaper that literally kind of a light went off in my head and I thought maybe I could codify this taste profiling I was doing and turn it into a technology by marrying it to math and build an algorithm that would allow people to discover songs connect songs based on the music illogical attributes so this taxonomy I had been kind of forming in my brain as a film composer that I would actually write it down and use that as a connective tissue and that could become sort of the solution for people discovering all these great bands that nobody knew about so in 1999 so is the sort of apex of the first big calm consumer calm boom I shared that here with a friend of mine who had already by then started and sold a company so I've been through the whole lifecycle of a start-up and named John Kraft and he said hey that's like go ahead you let's go start a company I said well how do you do that he said what's the write a business plan along what's how you do that I'll show you so we spent a weekend put together a business plan and about two months later had a million and a half dollars that was how it was done back then to launch a business and the the cornerstone of the idea was this what we came to call the Music Genome Project which was this enormous taxonomy fits squarely into the completely unscalable idea that Walker share with you before this the genome is a 450 attribute list of musicals of musical taxonomy that essentially captures every little detail of melody and harmony and rhythm and form instrumentation voice etcetera it's kinda like musical DNA and it's a gigantic list and we wrote it out and hired a few dozen musicians to come in and listen to songs one at a time and manually analyze them attribute by attribute assign a number to every song to collect musical DNA and hired a set of computer scientists to attach to that essentially an algorithm that could use that information to connect songs based on their musical proximity and we began to that turns about a year to build the first prototype and we literally did it on pencil and paper at first I kid you not we had ultimately about 75 musicians scribbling on paper and then we transferred that into Microsoft Excel and a year into our this project we built our prototype we had analyzed about 10,000 songs and our founding CTO wil Glaser had written an Excel macro that would allow us to compute the distance between any of these 10,000 songs the way it worked is you would pick one of the songs enter it into the search box and hit rank and the the macro would rank order least 10,000 songs by proximity about musical proximity to your source song so a year into this we give this thing a first spin we type in a Beatle song and we wait about three or four minutes for the macro to do his calculation and it out comes a list and the first song is a BG song and like oh [ __ ] you know doesn't work after all this time you know and believe me as entrepreneurs you will have many moments like that but listen to the track and it was uncannily similar to a Beatle song it turned out it was a very very early Bee Gees song at a time when as a band they were more or less a knockoff of the Beatles so it had found the perfect match among these 10,000 songs turns out so I went from despair to elation in a very short amount of time and realized you know well it kind of works so we kind of forged ahead kept analyzing more songs and sort of refining that the front end to this matching engine this was now 2001 though and and everything had gone to hell in a handbasket the dot-com boom had collapsed the music industry was in complete shambles a Napster was at its apex and in our first efforts to go raise money it was pretty clear that was not gonna be easy to do and so realizing we don't have to make our money last we began asking our employees in the course of 2001 to work for an ever smaller share of their salary until by the end of 2001 we weren't paying employees at all we call that salary deferral back then which incidentally is illegal in California apparently we couldn't afford an attorney though we had no idea that we were breaking the law and ultimately about 50 people work without salary for over two years to keep this thing going and we we managed to make it through the whole calm valley by essentially you know this group of people that sort of hung in there by the end of 2003 at 11 maxed out credit cards I think I owed like half a million dollars a personal debt and we owed close to two million dollars of back salary to all these employees five of whom were actually suing us for having done that I also had a personal obligation for five years on a large commercial office space in Auckland and I was a musician you know so it wasn't like if it didn't work out I'd go back to my lucrative band days and pay it all back quickly it was gonna be Mexico for me for sure we we hung in there and eventually after I'd pitch Pandora 348 times I found a series Beauty investor in 2004 March of o4 raised a nine million dollar round which I still don't quite know how it happened and we paid out two million dollars with salary that day we actually had an All Hands meeting which I will never forget we had All Hands meetings every two weeks at this time they were generally not very happy occasions because I was just asking people to work for two more weeks for no salary and this one and no one knew the money had come in the night before so when I sat down rather than giving my pitch to sort of two more weeks of sacrifice I pulled out of my back pocket this huge wad of envelopes and slapped them down the table and handed out like two million dollars a salary but much of your on the table everybody thought I was like you know it was a really bad joke was going to bounce or something but I paid everybody back yeah and we were able essentially to restart the business and went from really kind of this forlorn business we had not figured out how to make any money at it but we had built this really cool piece of IP this gigantic musical taxonomy and this matching engine that was a really killer you type in a song and it would send you back five tunes that were just remarkably similar and maybe three or four which you'd never heard before so it was like it's magical discovery box and then we what set about sort of figuring out what to do next and that's when the company took a big right-hand turn and repurposed that whole underlying technology and built this brand new thing that we came to call Pandora and we've launched that in the fall of 2005 in November of five actually we did a prototype with some friends and family and then launched it as a fully blown free service to the public in November of five and I just took off like a rocket ship and has not you know not stopped and it was you know we went from this bizarre a night experience it was not glamorous to this to be quite the opposite you know just experiencing this completely viral explosion that was propelled by the smartphone revolution of course which came to the summer of 2007 and we went from having you know 50 employees to now 1,700 and 50 offices and three countries around the world and it's a really incredible experience of course to go through that and one thing I want to talk a little bit about in this context you today is you know I think that one thing that the reason I'm still here and this company is still around which which has it has no business being I mean the the chances our company having survived that are close to zero when we raise our second amount of financing I think one out of a thousand companies was getting money and I get asked a lot of well you know how did this company survive all that and I think one of the key things was that we always had a very clear sense of purpose inside the business there was a reason why we were doing this that we all I think really believed in which was sort of two-sided coin one was that you know music is this magical thing that we all love but most people have a very hard time staying connected to it music especially as you get older radio doesn't not play the music you love and it's very time consuming to interact with it when you get a job it's hard to really have that time you get kind of connected from it but when you reconnect to music it's a powerful thing and we really believed in what we were doing so the good we could bring people by helping them enjoy that and the flip side of that coin is what we could do for artists they would be providing this platform that for the first time would start to surfacing music and playing it in a way it's completely blind to popularity which is again the cornerstone of the genome project so the music genome when it when it connects one song to another it doesn't know if that song it's playing is from a well-known established artist or some brand new band it's blind to that so it's a completely democratic sort of level playing field and we play about a hundred and forty thousand artists or so I think in our in our catalog just about every single artist plays every month on this service and there are 12,000 artists now Pandora that have at least 350,000 a unique listeners on the service that have created a station using their name to start it 12,000 and of those 12,000 about 80% have never played on any form of radio ever so it's this huge sea of what I think of as a the future musicians middle class that has been out there all this time but no one's been able to find them and our ambition is really to surface them and give them a future and I think throughout this process even when things were in their darkest moments that was something that I think sort of kept us all together and when this when the server when the company began to really grow a post launch of as Pandora I could see the company begin to evolve lots of exciting ways but I also knew that we needed to really hang on to something special that sort of that tap root that had kept us alive during those times and that I thought would be really important for us as we grew to maintain the integrity of the business and so we actually sat down and crafted what we call Pandora principles there are now seven of them and these principles are really kind of a statement about why we're around who we are what we care about you know how we treat each other the sort of cultural values if you will of the company and we imbue those into the business we really do take pains to hire based on them to fire based on them to promote based on them and everybody who comes into the company we hire about 70 or 80 people a month right now it's blows my mind and actually go through what call Pandora University which is a day-and-a-half set of sessions the capstone session of which is really is called Pandora principles where we talk people through this and teach them about it and and ensure that when they go into the company they absorb sort of and adopt these principles because I really have a huge belief that you know no matter how much of a head start you have how strong your brand is you know how good your fundamentals are as a business if you don't have a really firm grasp on the core principles and culture of your company you will eventually hit the rocks and I think that's true of companies that just about any stage certainly in small start you have two or three founders there's ample opportunity for things to go south and it's really important to do good housekeeping to keep your cultural house in order and I think that remains a real big strength of the company so now as I sort of look ahead and see what sort of possible you know I my I consider myself sort of the sort of Guardian of that inside the company and I think having sort of grown up the way we did over these sort of kind of a pretty rough few years in some ways we learned the value of that and I would really encourage all of you as you build your companies as you grow them to not underestimate the power of those things even as you have all these exciting prospects ahead and your audience is growing like tea Springs is and you can see all that opportunity to not forget the importance of sort of the fabric of your business how you treat each other the culture building is ultimately that's what will sustain you over a long period of time I can't you see the timing so I don't know am i doing okay I'm supposed to be looking somewhere a timer am i okay okay so I start a little bit early I'm happy to take questions if people have them I want to give a little time for that too so thanks Tim if you have any questions for him come on down it's not only the front and center question all right I when you said you were trying to raise your Series B and you you said that he didn't have any idea of what the business model would be how did you keep the people working without a clear vision of how you would make that work and how did you get the investors to pitch in you had to keep the employees around so they were chained to their desks and we locked in I think that there are a couple reasons that Pandora stuck around one as I said is this real sense of belief and a common purpose and a mission that was really important and this product that we all thought was pretty magical and that we could hang around long enough would would find its home the second is I think there's a phenomena that happens when you go through adversity one of two things happens either you scatter or you kind of come together and you actually start to work to sort of sustain yourselves kind of for each other I think that's part of would have happened at Pandora over the months as we began to do her salary month after month after a month it became you know you felt a certain obligation to people around you to contemplate saying to the person on your left you've been doing it for a year or one day you know what I'm done that just felt really hard to do so I think that was that was part of it as well and I certainly learned to be a motivational leader and if there's one piece of advice I would give to every single one of you about entrepreneurship it's learned public speaking and I don't mean learn to be able to talk in front of a large audience of people I mean just learn to speak learn to communicate to groups of all sizes and to be able to communicate an idea with passion with vision because no matter what you do no matter what your product is no matter what size your company is that will come in tremendously handy so you know that was part of it too when you had like two million dollars of outstanding wages how are you actually keeping everyone on I mean just ENTJ on myers-briggs and you're that convincing or how does that go okay again I think it's it's um I did pay salaries on my credit card for a while which I don't recommend I don't recommend credit card debt I remember one day being in my living room Ashley and laying out all my credit cards on the table filled the table up and I was trying to like sequence my minimum payments it was like a Tetris game like trying to figure out what to pay first not a good experience do not use your credit cards for your startup that was a bad mistake I think that I was the first to defer salary you know I you lead by example you know you like to first in last out that's how you gotta do it yeah I think all the questions of center around how you convince 50 people did not take salaries in two years will you just imagine this crowd as the 50 employees and give that pitch that you gave and also talk about how how you evolve that pitch over time [ __ ] that's hard how do that now that pitch you know what if I go back to that time I'll start shaking and sweating and get all nervous and my heart will pound I might not give the whole play - let me tell you what I would focus on I would say that we all know here that what we've created is unique and it's solving a gigantic problem no one in the unearthed is Vindhya we've done and when you use this product we all know how magical it is it will find its home everybody in the planet loves music there are millions of musicians that produce great music and they can't find each other when this thing finally finds its home it's gonna change culture and how many times in your life to get a chance to do that that's what this is about they work and so that pitch stay consistent through no look I mean part of it part of it is a pitching but part of is also leaning into each employee one by one taking them to lunch dinner understanding their problems empathizing with it really you know being close to them getting to know them getting to trust you that's really where it all starts yeah when you had made the Music Genome Project you struggled for a while to figure out what Pandora was gonna become what else could it have been what was the reaction it could have been in a big smoking hole in the ground for a long time well our original idea was we thought we would license it as a technology to everybody else so whether you're a retailer or ultimately a radio product that you could use the genome as a ingredient technology so it's kind of like the power bi and we actually did license into a handful of companies to do that but it turns out it's not a very good business and music retails and under such pressure we couldn't really generate a much revenue for it that's really what we were doing for a long time yeah so in the interest of time we'll take these last three hi Jen thanks so much for sharing your insight and being here I'm volunteer for hustle on my question is you know I'm new to the startup game and I want to know when is it appropriate to make pivots and when is it appropriate to you know stay committed to your idea that's a tough question to answer with sort of a set of rules because on the one hand I think that successful startups require a certain kind of irrational commitment to an idea that many people look at and say that's crazy it'll never work I mean the genome was that idea when we when I did my adventure pitches you know I would show them a PowerPoint set of powerpoints and one sly would be one of seven pages of musical analysis these attributes that I would explain yeah we have human beings doing it one by one takes 20 minutes do with three minute pops on and look at me what the [ __ ] is wrong with you you know like you kidding me you're gonna fund this and it was crazy I mean it was it was flat-out crazy has an idea and a lot of people just do you off course so you have to have a certain irrational singular belief and be stubborn about it but I also think that you should be open to discovering new opportunities and so I think that it's a combination of believing in one idea but when things present themselves yeah don't be overly obsessively kind of stuck with your idea that's the best I can tell you thank you the first person stole my question so I had to come up with second sitting here my question for you is as you create a platform you have this amazing vision I'm for example I'm creating something that I view is like gonna change the world and you were plan is to bring together thousands of artists or you know whatever it may be and you want to create this collaborative platform where you want to pay the artists you know for their time for whatever they collaborated and sold on the marketplace how do you reach an equilibrium point between making the artists happy because a lot of artists are gonna say you're paying me [ __ ] money for what I'm producing and you're taking in all this money and you have all this pressure of investors etc how do you reach that that peaceful point so I think these things need to be seen with a long-term lens and I think music industry's going through it numbers of industries have already gone through which is sort of a period of constructive destruction they're changing and I think the long-term view the long-term vision of the industry that we think everyone will come together around is it will music will exist on a connected platform so it will not be broadcast radio or you you play a song it goes out to the ether you even know who's listening to it when what they think of it they're disconnected to a platform where you're sending that email that that that music to people you know who they are you know how they if they like it or don't and you can communicate with them and you will have access as a musician to all of those fans directly and you will have fantastic tools to communicate with them so imagine this you're in your band you're you're in a van your band driving from San Francisco to Seattle to play a show we used to do it all the time and you just thought you know let's stop in Portland tomorrow night and play pull out your iPhone zoom into your Pandora artist account log in zoom into Portland look up how many listeners they are thumbed up your songs or create a station with your name record a 15-second Audio bumper on the phone upload it the next 24 hours that message plays to people in Portland that have light your music or create a station with a link to buy a ticket to that show by the way we can already do that so that over time is going to completely transform the entire economics of the business that's what people will come to understand I think yeah thank you thanks for your speech was so inspiring also very entertaining community you know we're fortunate all of us to be at this time where people were working for companies that are very mission driven or we're creating companies we're very people focused and it's awesome that you're able to inspire 50 people to stay on in that way how do you scale that you know it's one thing to have a conversation take 50 people out to get to know them how do you scale among the organization of 7,200 people that type of people focus management and putting people first and keeping people aligned with the mission yeah so that's a big focus for us right now because it one person can do that six people can't actually ultimately to sustain a culture like that hundreds of people need to be active advocates for that so we do a lot of training now our sort of our next evolution as a business is how do you take the several hundred managers now who imagine anywhere from 1 to 15 20 people and give them all the skills they need to be equally powerful ambassadors inside the company that's the task of leaders and it's I think it's one of the transitions that founders go through over time is eventually in spite of what Walker says he's not going to be answering emails all day long and doing he's gonna be pulled into other things and he will teach other people to do that as well as he did who will teach other people to do that and it's it's actually frustrating as a founder because eventually feel like you're not as connected as you were and you'll do some of that to stay in touch with it but your job becomes transmitting what your your passion and your ideas and values to other people and helping them continue to do that onward that's that's the transition you go through alright thank you guys very much [Applause]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so yesterday was a pretty surreal moment for me uh i did a all hands in front of our company and there were 200 people there so becoming it's kind of interesting i was thinking becoming a successful entrepreneur is kind of like getting fat you just go day to day you're doing what you're doing you have to hire someone they do a great job more needs pop up you hire more people and then all of a sudden there's 200 people and uh what's also interesting along the way is more and more opportunities and luck and you realize you have more and more reach to actually change the world so pretty crazy and uh it's super humbling for me to be in front of 500 hustlers today this is pretty cool all right so life before the hustle was really good like like many people i totally squandered my college years so i i went into college and i want to say september 1999. so i skipped class and day traded i was partying all the time and i played too much starcraft i actually got an ultimatum about starcraft from someone and chose starcraft so that was interesting um yeah and then so after college uh i kind of lost the entrepreneurial bug to be honest in 2001 uh a market crash like that can really do it to you i'd always wanted to be an entrepreneur going into college but that just didn't really seem like a reality so i joined the investment banking finance hedge fund world so i was investing in a lot of you know big technology media and telecom companies and then christmas day 2008 so i felt like i had been winning and winning and winning in life you know i had landed this amazing job at a great hedge fund i was one week away from getting that bonus that was going to change my life and i was pretty stoked and then i got fired so i mean i i kind of became a bit of a social pariah among my friends a lot of people were getting like yo at this time and everything fell apart so it was pretty horrible uh so so two things kind of happened in the next month or two one was uh my sister asked me for help finding a credit card poked around online was pretty dissatisfied with what was out there but couldn't quite articulate what was bugging the crap out of me about the experience and then my parents called me about a month later as well um they said you know the market has been doing really horribly our investments aren't doing well we're going to hire a financial advisor and by the way we hired this financial advisor he sold us this great product that locks your rates and gives you like this fixed payment and there's a five percent fee and like all this other crazy stuff so they got totally screwed and and the the two problems sound pretty distinct but over time um i reflected a bit on this and i realized they're actually quite similar there's just information asymmetry between the people who are providing the service and the people who are looking for things to buy or for great advice now your friends and family have your best interests in mind really but they may not know what's going on i mean they're not really financial professionals and they don't spend all their time creating excel spreadsheets and the broker the agent the retail banker the financial advisor they're really just doing their job and the affiliate marketer they're just doing their job they're feeding their family they're behave they're not bad people now the internet had pretty much changed this in every single other vertical out there but not not yet in finance so my first thought was hey i can solve my sister's problem uh you know i've been doing excel all my life i can just suit up shoot some excel lasers out of my elbows and crank out this spreadsheet with you know hundreds of credit cards and i can give her the objectively correct answer so this spreadsheet started getting kind of forwarded around to my friends and forwarded more and forwarded more and i said hey this could be a web app i mean i haven't programmed in 10 years but you know like let's just put this out on the internet and see if it can help people so i'll talk more about that later so another interesting point i mean consider this my social network had zero entrepreneurs a bunch of use useless finance people and and and i was launching into this endeavor starting a company and so why did i even have a shot i couldn't raise venture capital financing if i wanted to i mean where would i go who would who would give someone with no programming experience no startup experience and you know like money it just doesn't make any sense so think about this uh you have a huge advantage uh when you're kind of launching out towards a niche so i don't know if you guys know sites like mr money mustache or yeah so so compare mr money mustache to money magazine if you have the same values as mr money mustache you're gonna love everything he writes money can never compete with mr money mustache when it comes to that crud the same with the o'reilly show versus cnn i mean you kind of or cnn might be a bad example now but you know when when you're targeting that niche where the values of the people who are your customers are perfectly aligned with you you can no one can compete with you so that was kind of our situation you're also more nimble than the big guys that one's more self-explanatory you don't have overhead you don't have to build consensus you can just go my sister knew a thing or two about affiliate marketing she had started a coupon website that had done pretty well and i thought hey you know at least you can explain to me how this works and now i have a mental model of someone else who has done this that's had some success so maybe i can do it too now finance background is kind of interesting um that was really more less about the finance and more because i could get journalists actually take me seriously so that turned out to be really important over time and life is an investor the the one thing um i was actually good at as an investor was short selling companies so figuring out which companies were going to crash and burn so i i had met you know thousands of companies over the past couple years and seen like certain patterns that just weren't quite that good and i highly recommend peter thiel's book zero to one a lot of common principles you know there's kind of companies that are going to be mired in brutal competition their whole lives and companies who have just these amazing businesses that are going to get less and less competitive over time and it's kind of always one or the other so figure out which one yours is here's the first version of nerdwallet it's a non-technical founders website um any of you can cut and paste from stack overflow and put together something like this in a few weeks so this is really trying to convert a spreadsheet into kind of a kayak for credit cards uh this is kind of our growth over the next six years the numbers aren't huge by a lot of standards but these are really high value intent driven customers shopping for financial products so these are really valuable people so this is me coding the first version of the website this is a bathroom in uh grenada spain uh in a hostel so but i splurged and got my own bathroom so that was cool okay so a few things i learned quickly launched the website knew it was better than anything else out there i mean there were so many more cards listed on the site it actually told you how to sort the cards in a logical manner but no one came and i bet this is a really common problem among every entrepreneur so one thing i quickly realized is when you're at a sunday barbecue you're not really triggered to talk about credit card comparison websites so i i would definitely keep that in mind uh you you have to figure out how to do acquisition so uh the second thing i did was say hey uh you know maybe journalism or pr is a good megaphone for what we're trying to do well i made the mistake of not talking to people who had done this before journalists who receive pitches all the time or pr people who do this for a living and just try to go at it on my own and that was really inefficient as you can imagine journalists probably get thousands of emails a day from companies just like yours so if you want to figure out how to get in their head you have to understand what bugs them what they need to do their job and then you'll know how to approach them the third thing i realized is seo is a slog so it was really about deciphering hey what does it take exactly to get to where we want to go and that required figuring out exactly how much the leaders had of the main components of search so i'll talk that i'll talk about that a bit later but you know within five minutes of doing that calculation realized there was no way we were going to do this in less than a couple years last thing that i bet all of you have run into as well is that paid channels are prohibitively expensive so you're basically at auction for people's attention when you go into a paid channel like scm and chances are our problem was if you want to be more consumer friendly than anyone else you're going to be monetizing less than anyone else therefore when you're at auction you're not going to win so paid was out of the question so at that point it was about okay i figured out what the most viable acquisition channel to build a sustainable business was at this point for us it had to be seo so this is uh jake and i my co-founder and barbados on vacation when we had a poorly timed life hacker hit and the entire website went down because it was cut and pasted from stack overflow and hosted on a server that costs seven dollars a month so we were trying to fix the site and i realized this is when i learned about database indexing which is kind of funny if any of you are coders but that's not the time you want to be learning about database indexing okay so 2010 was actually really demoralizing despite these two successes so money magazine featured us as the best credit card website in 2010. so we saw maybe i remember we got about seven cents a visitor so whatever 300 divided by seven cents is that's how many people can so uh i thought well what better success with this press megaphone could we possibly have than getting into money magazine i mean this is a magazine that millions of people read so what do we do i can't get money magazine every day and even if i did that wouldn't be nearly enough to sustain a business so that was highly demoralizing the second thing was so jake happens to be well i won't mention this but we gotta so jay got us into life hacker but it only generated uh five thousand dollars in revenue so live hacker is actually much better because it's an online publication with like millions of people visiting it so better conversion rates and traffic but still you can't get lifehacker every day okay so what did we do we realized that seo was this massive massive fire hose of traffic and nothing else mattered so we dropped all of our product development and just focus on seo you have no idea how horrible that feels everything is burning around you your friends mock your website for being so ugly it runs really slowly but hey your most limited resource is your time as a founder and you better let stuff burn if you're going to figure out how to do the things you need to do correctly so um this was kind of hard work we kind of like worked worked worked and eventually we started hiring interns off craigslist uh one of who actually turned into a full-time employee that was super super instrumental to our success so that's anisha who ended up running our credit card business for three years okay so 2011 was the first time that we realized hey this might work there's really only two things that matter in seo so a lot of nerd wallets people will give me a hard time about saying the word drivers way too often but it's all about figuring out the drivers behind whatever acquisition channel you're pursuing and just focusing super super religiously on those drivers you want to build your entire business organization around those drivers if you're going to get them right otherwise people are going to start running off and trying to help out but not doing the things that really matter so in seo it's about quality links and quality content what does this mean product doesn't matter engineering doesn't matter vc funding doesn't matter in fact vc funding is detrimental because no vc is going to wait around for you to do this the right way and pr only matters if it builds links so this is 2011. things are way different now but this is kind of like the hustle stage when you're trying to get off the ground okay so the other thing that was super important was realizing that google's not a black box use your common sense don't read anything online about seo i mean it's kind of important to read it to get the basics but you have to think from the perspective of a google engineer or a google quality team what's going to happen in five years how would you write the algorithm if you have a question in your head say what would i do if i are the engineer writing the search algorithm and we always went by that there's also no secret sauce it's just hard work this is kind of the pitfall of most seos i've met they want this payoff in two weeks three months four months they're not willing to invest two years three years to really win over the entire market and again your most limited resources founder time if you don't extract yourself from the business drivers you're never going to get to the scale you need to succeed so that's why it's also important to know exactly what kind of output you need on links and on content to get to where you need to go okay so our first big investment as a company was spending every dime we had on hiring a pr firm prowess pr so this was five thousand dollars a month and it was the first big investment so what did we learn building a reputation is really tough with journalists they don't want to get burned they have a job to do so their job is to put out informative news every day they have a quota to hit they have deadlines to meet and they're flooded with emails so you can't burn them and you have to speak to them in a language that's conducive to get them doing their job as quickly as possible so talk to an ex-journalist they'll know exactly what i'm talking about uh this is anisha again our first content hire so she was put in charge of writing all the content i instantly realized she was much better at writing than i was and this isn't well i'll talk about that some other time um but she hired and inspired great content writers um who actually cared about the topic at hand uh to really push our brand and content forward i repeat every single piece of content is a touch point for your brand your brand is just an aggregate of everything everyone hears and sees about your company so this was super important um so anisha was actually studying arabic at brown she wanted to go to syria and spend some time there to learn arabic and fortunately for nerd wallet the arab spring happened and she couldn't go so we asked her to drop out of school and join us full time and she was super instrumental okay so 2012 we were starting to grow a real user base we had people focused on all the drivers of the business 2013 was more of the same and what got us there what got us through all the hard times the slow roi at first was realizing hey what exactly do we need to do quantitatively to win over time and that forced the org structure the hiring the business practices that actually ensued so uh okay so i'd say when you're small you got to do whatever it takes to figure out how to beat your small competitors you got to give yourself credit you're not going to get to where you need to go immediately not on a run rate basis so give your credit that you're going to iterate and get better over time it's going to happen however if what you need to do um if it's 500 great links a month or whatever it is is so far-fetched that you know it'll never happen don't even try be realistic about what's completely futile and then when you're at scale you're really screwing up if you're growth hacking or thinking about tactics there are people that are way smarter than you i guarantee you um at these things your job is to hire and inspire them and put them to work in effective ways and so i'd say my biggest successes and failures in the last four years were all people's names so 2012 to 2013 was probably the hardest part of my uh entire career as an entrepreneur managing people is really tough i had a lot of really poor preconceived notions of what a good culture or management situation looked like based on my previous tenure as a hedge fund analyst where people would throw telephones at you and pay you a lot of money so that's not really the right way to inspire people and then last thing i realized is that people build companies as an investor i had this totally warped perception that business models and business modes build companies that may be true later later later on in your company but it's very logical your output as an entrepreneur is going to be the quality and enthusiasm of people working in parallel doing the right things okay so a few tips for first-time managers because this really hit close to home and i learned a lot of lessons the really hard way first of all it's not about rah-rah-rah you got to be authentic people can handle the truth people want the truth people will freak out and think you don't know what you're doing if you don't tell them the truth that they obviously know so be authentic and don't be afraid to communicate what's wrong with your company vulnerabilities employees everyone people are just really perceptive um alignment is super tough so you gotta totally over communicate on your mission your expectations and give immediate candid feedback in a really supportive way to people a big mistake over time my assumption going into management was that the issues were usually dna related i'd be like oh this person just can't do this that's almost never the case once you have a really candid discussion around what is going wrong you realize they're not set up for success or they're not doing the thing that they're actually good at so that's important so number three super critical especially as you scale you are guaranteed to run into tons of problems misunderstandings people are going to step on each other's toes you have to confront these issues candidly and quickly you want people to tell you when they think your product direction is wrong you want people to tell you when they think you're not leading the company properly otherwise you're never going to get there and lastly learn about people it really becomes more about understanding people at this stage the business strategy is super easy the people really hard and so now we we crossed 2.2 million users at the end of last year we're at nearly 200 employees and at this stage uh when we're about a hundred people started thinking really hard well where's this company ultimately going and how can we be successful in two or three years so hired some great people um boscar built the data infrastructure and security teams at linkedin dan ran biz ops which is business operations and strategies at linkedin flow was the first recruiter at zynga and ken ran communications at trulia which was kind of interesting because they had succeeded in the exact same way we succeeded and ken was there from pretty much the beginning and so a few summary points here so first of all yeah understand what channel do i need to dominate what are the drivers behind that channel what exact metrics do i have to hit and even if i'm making seven cents per visitor now understand what are the big guys making what will that ultimately be so that you will have faith that you will get there eventually tactics tactics become pretty commoditized pretty quickly so it's about quick iteration accurate diagnosis candid conversations and you want to build your business processes around the drivers of your acquisition channel and then hire great people i can't emphasize this one enough if you don't learn how to sell a vision you're not going to attract great people and companies are built by people working in parallel with differing talents than you so you have to learn how to do that uh yeah but thank you opening it up for questions thanks tim we have time for one or two questions hey great talking thanks um so you're talking about seo and you're saying not to look on google for seo tips so i was wondering how you would go about learning about seo and the good strategies yeah so just on a really high level i mean if you think about it from google's perspective their company succeeds if they surface the best results to consumers that's how people ultimately end up going back to google over and over again over time so if you think what about what that means in the long term it means the indicators of search quality are going to change over the time they're going to constantly improve also google has chrome google has google analytics google has all these other indicators of search quality that they may or may not claim that they use but hell if i'm google i'm trying to offer the best search results i'm going to track everything that these different sources of data give me and so you ultimately need to figure out how to build to meet that need to win five years out rather than getting mired in this like brutal competition in the short run so what about like resources like seomoz i don't know if you know about that like yeah i think i think moz is a great resource so when you especially when you're earlier on um i think it's more relevant in terms of understanding what other people are doing but tactics commoditize quickly and there's pretty much open transparency across the board in terms of what everyone's tactics are if you use moz thanks thanks again for the talk um so you talked about hiring some really great people um at what point like how do you manage that you know you're working with some really great people wouldn't you feel like at some point they could just you know kind of bend off and go do their own thing like how do you make sure that you're continuously inspiring them and you know kind of holding the reins of the company yeah so i i have every expectation that great people will peel off and go do their own thing um so i really think about you know finding people at the right cross section in their careers where this is the right opportunity they're going to grow in the right way and they're going to have chances to do things that excite them and that's really to me what a company is it's just a collection of these people i mean of course they're going to go leave and do bigger and better things afterwards great that's all the time we have thank you okay thanks

[Music] [Music] Hey guys you're right great to be back at hustle con um so basically for me hustling means finding out the rules of the game that you're playing and then how to break them and put them in your favor now today I'm going to talk about advertising but you can apply this stuff to pretty much anything it's just a way of thinking so the reason that I'm going to be talking about advertising today is because a few years ago I pulled off my biggest hustle and it got quite a lot of press but I'd never really talked before about kind of how I I did that so I wanted to talk today about that and so this story starts um just me and my business partner at vungle we were in a tiny office in London uh just us two and like three interns and one day I was just reading TechCrunch and I saw this story saying hey there's this incubator in San Francisco called Angel pad and they're giving every company that joins $100,000 and at the bottom it said and there's one spot left for somebody reading this article so I said to my business partner I was like hey man like imagine what we we could do with $100,000 we should apply and he was like n man and there's no point because we looked at their Twitter account and they were saying like oh we just got 2,000 applications in the last 24 hours and so he's like we just we just get lost in the noise you know but I was like come on let's at least let's give it a shot and so we had this objective get into Angel Pad but they they were telling us the way to do it is to submit an application that's that's we might as well have just like thrown in the trash like it's not going to get seen amongst 2,000 people you know we we had to find a way to stand out so what we did is we looked okay who's the guy running the incubator and there's this guy called to mass and so we start to think all right how how can we get his attention so we had the objective and now we had this clear goal right how do we get to M's attention and I'm going to deviate from the story a bit now because if I'm like listening to a talk if I'm reading a book I want to know I don't want to just hear the story because that can often be Ed a bit like I want to hear the exact steps like what did someone actually do in this scenario and so hopefully I can kind of take you into what my head what I was thinking at that time so all right my goal is get on tomas's radar having that goal and then the the first step so as I said you can apply this thinking to whatever if you've got a goal you can apply this thinking to whatever for me I was like all right God get his attention and the way I'm going to do it I chose to use LinkedIn advertising I chose this because you know LinkedIn is not as big as Google or Facebook so potentially there might be more ways to exploit it because it's not as established and also you know my audience is there he's he's a user of LinkedIn so once I've chosen the the game if you like I've got to find out the rules of the game and then how I can break them so if you've never seen a LinkedIn ad before basically like when you're browsing LinkedIn you've got these ads on the on the right side of the page that come up a bit bit like Google AdWords and so the first set of rules I had to learn about was the what are the rules of this ad unit and now I just like love breaking stuff I I love breaking websites um I should I should have been a QA tester probably uh so I just the way I found out the rules because I just typed in random [ __ ] into the text boxes and see what you can do with it and so I found the rules that basically you have to have a title less than 25 characters um an image like 50 pixels by 50 pixels and a short description now a bonus I didn't actually use this uh kind of loophole but actually you could set the name as who the ad was from from anyone so if you wanted you could make an ad looking like it came from Google um that was just a a loophole I didn't use that and so the next set of rules was all right you create you've got your advert and then um the next set of rules is about how you target your ad now LinkedIn lets you do some really cool stuff you can Target by uh the company that someone's at and the job title and basically as you layer on this more specific targeting you see that number on the right it shows you how many people are going to see your ad so me being me and as I said you want to find out what are the rules I tried running an ad just targeting super specific so just job title CEO Company vungle so we're targeting a person of one okay so that that that number on the right said one but it didn't it didn't let you do that says like you know you've got a Target you add to to more people you you're not targeting enough people so I added one more company so now I'm targeting the CEO of fungal or AOL so that's two people but it's it's still saying you know that's not a big enough set so I added one more company that's too small one more no and so now we've got Microsoft and Apple in there as well so that's five and then keep laying on so now it's targeting six and I was saying it's not enough I'm not sure how much time we got but I I wanted to keep I want to keep going through this because this is the process that I went through so I want to I want you guys to see as well we're going to find out the rules so targeting seven people now okay what the hell it it accepted it so now we know the rules that we can Target seven people is the minimum number of people you need to run and ad on LinkedIn I don't know why they chose that number maybe nobody had actually done this process before but for me having found out this what that meant is I now knew how to Target down to an individual person because what I could do is I could Target hey the the exact person let's say the CEO of vungle and then what I could do is I could just add random people that probably are not even going to see my ad let's say like Bank of China or Mexican TV studio or something like I'd have my person I want and in like six randomers that I don't really care and so the next bit was how to pay for your ad now LinkedIn they recommended to pay per person that clicks the ad they recommended paying like $8 but the thing is because I'm only targeting seven people it made sense to actually pay on the other option they give which is CPM to pay per thousand Impressions I'm I'm I'm tting seven people and so um the they suggest that I bid $252 per thousand people so so that's what I'm going to go with and the last set of rules is uh the review process so basically when you submit an ad on LinkedIn it basically says hey we're going to review your ad it'll take 24 hours and we'll get back to you and um some of the times when I submitted an ad they they rejected it but what I found out is because you submit it and then it take 24 hours it was a manual process so what that meant is I could just submit exactly the same ad and someone else the next day would review it and then often it went through and also sometimes they didn't like like if I was linking to a different website they might say like hey we don't like what you're linking to you know so what I did is I used a URL shortener so kind of put up the ad linking to one page and then once they manually approved it I just changed where that link was pointing to so to point it somewhere else now when you're finding out the rules and stuff it's also important to know the risks you know of of of doing uh of trying to play the game and so you know I didn't do anything illegal uh not too illegal and um uh the main risk for me was that my account could have got banned so just the ction I took against that was just using I just created a fake account to be testing with you know now I'm going to jump back to the story now so just remind you I had been in London just me and my business partner tiny office and we' seen this Tech crunch article that there's one spot left and so we needed to get toas the guy that running it how can we get his attention so using the these bits I found what I did is I created an adver on LinkedIn with a picture of his face so this this fits in with doing the rules it's a 50x50 picture it's a title less than 75 characters and then what I did is because I can now have this ability to Target down to an individual person I Target it to him and people connected to him so he's colleagues his invest different investors Etc and so basically I'd seen this Tech crunch post on Thursday um and I basic yeah so I read this post said to my business partner like hey man we should apply and then just kind of quickly um hack together uh this ad campaign that same day and so basically if you were browsing LinkedIn that day and you're connected to Mars you see a picture of his face on the side of the screen and when you click it it took you to a landing page and um this was a video that we just did in one take so I just pulled out my phone and I just started filming my business partner so I was like get my business partner phone we just did this in one take and I was like pitch into the phone why why do we deserve this last spot so basically when you land on this page and you click play it's me and my business partner we're talking directly to Tomas like Tomas in your background you're a legend we deserve this last spot we won't let you down this my phone number this my email address give me a call and so this was Thursday I kind of just went to sleep and forgot about it and um the next day I just got this short uh email oh s and and so basically had a phone call with him and um because he said hey can we have a call so had this call and he was like Hey Okay so I've seen the advert you got my attention it's cool but take it down now he's like everyone is calling me about this he said uh he'd been on a flight from New York to San Francisco he he hadn't had email access so he just got off his flight and he's checking his iPhone he had over 20 emails from people basically like dude have you seen this video like these kids really want to talk to you now basically so we had this phone call on the Friday and then basically the next week we had another Skype call and then he basically said all right guys I've decided who's got the last spot let's have a final Skype call and we were like man like we've got our team here do you have to reject us on video can't you just like phone us to reject us and he's like no let's do a final Skype call and so we had this call and he's like all right guys I've decided um to take a risk you guys have got the last spot so we're like high-fiving around the office and he's like okay but if you take this last spot you've got to move to America permanently because I've invested in some companies before where they just go straight back to their own country and you know the investors don't like it and stuff so we're like yep that's fine we'll move to America and so we' seen the ad on Thursday this was the next Thursday and he's like all right that's great well it starts on Monday so just get the first flight out here so that's basically how I end up in America now the the best the best thing about this ad is potentially how much it cost so this is I I as I said I run some targeting his friends but one targeting toas cost one [Applause] cent because I was paying per thousand Impressions F five people saw it two people clicked it and that was Tomas so that cost 1 cent now just to show that this wasn't kind of just uh luck um just some other examples of how I used this hack uh I was just reading an article that color at the time had just raised like 40 million so we're like okay can we target the CEO of color and do something so all right objective Target the CEO of bill um is Bill and so we ran and ad with Bill's face on it tar big and and then got an email from Bill as well he's like hey I've seen your ad we've got an ad agent because we were doing ad uh videos at the time so he's like we've already got an agency but you know we'll try and let's see if we can slot you in and he inted me to his team and that cost $2.78 to get to Bill and then roio you know it's big Mobile gaming company so we're like all right can we contact roio's CEO uh he's called Michael head now we didn't get to Michael directly but we got one of the VPS of roio uh sent us an email saying like hey guys smart ad um and we we started talking to them and that cost $324 and then we were like all right what about Spotify can we get them as a client and so we just put up on a saying I want Spotify as a client and um and then uh yeah got an email from Spotify saying hey you guys got our attention and um we actually got Spotify as a client but that one was a bit more expensive that was $16 okay so to summarize this was the different steps that I took now there's no point we can't all in the audience like recreate step for step this advertising bit otherwise they'll definitely ban us all um and you know that was a while ago so LinkedIn have changed their their systems but hopefully you can kind of use those philosophies to hack whatever system you're coming up to whether that's applying for a job you know if you're if you've got a job they tell you just submit a job application you might as well just throw your CV in the trash like no that's not going to get people's attention the way that you do this is by looking at what's your objective what's the game that I'm playing and then finding out the rules of the game and how to break them so this isn't just limited to LinkedIn advertising I I kind of take this thing into lots of stuff that I do and so these are my contact details and I'd love to hear how you guys uh kind of use this thinking and what kind of hacks you come up with thanks a lot so I don't know if anyone had any questions thanks Jack if you have any questions please come to the front hey great talk um I was just wondering if you had any other stories of something you've hacked in a in a similar manner any other hacks um yes so uh well I I've done some of hacks but like idea hacks I have that I haven't tried yet because I haven't had an objective would be Facebook advertising is quite interesting because what you can do is you can Target people by email address so you can upload like a list of email addresses so you could think how you could use that thinking with Facebook because what you do is you just have the one email address of who you want to Target and in a load of junk email addresses that you don't care about so then it's how do I get that one individual um I also kind of use this kind of thinking for like Amazon um so when I'm doing stuff like I my account got banned on Amazon and so so because I like buy so much stuff then I return it um and so I just like if I wanted to buy like a pair of headphones what I do is just buy like the top 10 selling headphones on Amazon try all 10 and then return nine uh they didn't really like that but so basically the way with Amazon what I did is I found the rules of Amazon how do they see an account and so basically what I did is I found basically a way to be undetected on Amazon which is uh you can set up like a virtual computer so I'm using another computer that has a different email address um and and a different IP address Etc uh you there's ways you can like mask your phone number and then you just buy a ver you you know those gift cards you buy it like Safeway and stuff then obviously they can't track you back to your credit card so basically it's just finding out the rules of the game how does Amazon track you it's your credit card it's your phone number it's your address and it's your IP address and stuff so how do we break those rules credit card get like a gift card so they can't track you phone number you can use something like twillo it's really cheap email you can just use a fake email address address I just changed the address a bit Yeah and and so the same with um Netflix Netflix gives you like a 30-day or 60-day trial so but it's it's limited by the address so what I do is say I'm 1 two 3 Fourth Street I just do 1 two 3 Fourth Street Unit A Unit B Unit C so you just keep getting free trial awesome thanks so much hi have you ever done a hack on somebody and really made them mad and wished you hadn't because there were negative consequences uh well yes so doing that LinkedIn advertising um again part of the bit that I said in there is knowing the risks so if I'm doing these hacks I've at least got to know the risks that I'm going through so one we targeted um uh a dating website like Match.com and we used their logo and targeting there and we got like a a cease and deceased letter and they also emailed linked in in a bit uh but what we did is again it's not in the wris like cease and deceased they're not this highly unlikely they're going to sue you unless you like really annoy them you know so we just took it out the senten they took down a ad but um then we actually kind of just turned it back on the lawyer we were like no dude this is only people targeting at your company it's not to the public can you intro us to someone else on your team who does BD instead of and then they did I think I think it's just about knowing the risks and not pushing it too far you know you just got to know the risks of what you're doing um and just knowing if you can take on those risks and not going so far that it has negative consequences thanks hey man hey J so um I have a question what if you want to get into some program but you have no idea who's the organizer you know nobody there and you cannot find all the emails you don't you just don't know anything like who is running this thing what you can do to to like hack I mean you should be able to find out something about them you know like I didn't know tomas's email address or anything I just went on like crunch Bas or that Tech crunch the article said like hey Tomas is running it so I think it' be quite rare that you can't at least find the name of someone doing it like 500 startups you'd see Dave McClure like why combinator Sam Alman you can just like what you do is you just Google the thing and see what people are mentioned as being involved with it you know like that that's what we did is just uh reading different Tech press and stuff okay thank you just I wanted to uh kind of add on that last question uh sometimes just physical surveillance tracking someone down meeting them on the street is the best way to do it you know find out where corporate headquarters is walk up hey okay yeah right [Applause] um I'll try that one next time so uh so I'm sure you use many tools to help you with these hacking what would you say are your top three tools like a we plugin that allows you to track when your emails are open stuff like that uh so twio can be quite off-putting because cuz when they put out the ads they're like hey talk to your developer or something about it but it's actually quite simple to use like once you get started and so twio is really call for just basically how I use twilio as well is you know when you sign up to stuff online and then they ask for your phone number sometimes it requires your phone number and then just you get these random C calls from advertisers like later on basically I use twio I basically set up a number and it just goes straight to voicemail so whenever I'm signing up for something I just put in my twilio number and it will go straight to voicemail so it doesn't bother me at all you know so I like twio Boomerang for Gmail is like the main tool that I love because you can like schedule what time an email goes and stuff um there's one called mail track which is just it's kind of like WhatsApp for email like it shows when they opened the emails and stuff um there's lots of different ones that I like like I use product hunt quite a lot so find different tools and stuff on there awesome thanks thanks we have time for one more question if anyone has one where do you get your t-shirts uh I'd like to say Teespring because he's speaking a bit later but it's not but I I could I could basically they could probably run their whole business just of me I have quite a lot of t-shirts cool thanks for the talk um so I was wondering on the conversion rate of a successful hack when you choose an objective and a weapon of choice how many times you go in learning the risks and the games rules of the game and then you can figure out a way to game the system um I mean for me yeah LinkedIn AB I wasn't really expecting to find that breakthrough you know like it was just messing around with it I think it's kind of thinking about something that you could apply to other stuff like the in LinkedIn advertising I was able to use it with Tomas because I'd already been experimenting with it before so I think it's good if you can the way I do it is I just Target systems that I could use more than once you know like I wouldn't find a hack specific to Angel pad I I'd be T I'd just be playing around with different systems and then even if I don't have an objective at that time just by playing around then if I see something come up you know I saw that ad and in the same day I could create the ad the ad campaign so I think by targeting kind of General bits like I'd be interested messing around more with like Facebook ads and all these different other AD Products that come up you know yeah that that's why I think is like something general just quick add-on question how much of your free time do you spend learning about systems well it's procrastinating isn't it so that's what I do a lot just like just mess around on the internet thank you very much a lot thanks great thank [Applause] you

At Hustle Con Arram Sabeti explained how to make decisions when you have too many choices and how he founded ZeroCater without a technical co-founder.

Arram is the founder and CEO of ZeroCater. A true hustler, Arram took a low-level job at Justin.tv to gain experience. He created a spreadsheet to streamline the lunch-ordering process, quit his job, and started pitching with zero lines of code.

ZeroCater graduated from YC in 2011, raised $1.5m (their only funding), and bootstrapped their way to profitability and 100 employees.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

[Music] [Music] okay hey everyone my name is Aram saetti I'm the founder of zerocater uh today I'm going to tell you about how I started zerocater without writing a single line of code for the first 12 months so so some uh quick background first started zero about 5 years years ago we're up to 880 employees now we are feeding over 700 companies and we have offices in San Francisco DC Chicago and New York so 2007 I discover Hacker News and I become completely completely obsessed with everything to do with startups and I have this very romanticized idea of sleeping under a desk and I can't wait to start a company so only problem is I'm 21 years old at the time and I have no idea how to do this so I figure the best plan is to join a startup figure out what it's all about and then go do my own thing so to this end I sell my car I get a ride to the Bay Area and I start looking for housing I convinced this retired dentist to give me the keys before he's gotten a signature or money or anything and I started applying to jobs now my timing for this could not have been better neither can my clicker there we go so it was 2008 and nobody was hiring and especially nobody was hiring somebody with no particular marketable skills so I applied to job after job after job and got nothing so I started applying to every job I could find because at this point I was really starting to run out of money and you know I don't still get nothing I end up walking to downtown Berkeley and I walk into every open door and actually ask for a job application and as one does in this sort of situation I got a job at you know uh B and Jerry's fun fact this guy eventually became a customer so meanwhile I come across a job post for Justin TV and I apply it's for a community manager job and I actually get a response back and I go through a series of interviews and each time and I think this is the only time they did interviews this way over the entire time I was there but each time they would tell us how many other candidates we were competing with so it was like 24 people 16 people and I really started thinking of ways it could stand out so I i' tell them things like just to be fair I should mention I'm going to quit in a year and start my own company this is what you call a high variance strategy and I got the call and they decided not to hire me for that job but apparently my startup enthusiasm had made an impression and they decided to make a role for me and I started at Justin TV as the fifth employee doing office operations now if you don't know what office operations is it's kind of like the junk drawer of startup jobs if something doesn't go somewhere you throw it to that guy and he'll take care of it don't worry about it uh so I did this for 18 months and I met a a lot of really great people I learned a lot I went from being clueless to slight slightly less clueless and it was it just a really educational experience but you know after 18 months I started to get worried that I was stuck because I only planned to be there for a year so I gave myself a deadline I decided I was going to quit my job in six months so I had to come up with an idea and get it to RAM and profitable by then now I was living off of less than $1,500 a month at the time so Ramen profitable was kind of a low bar and I would do things so I didn't forget like add a countdown timer to my desktop and change my work password to six months quit and this is this is just uh how I did for a while so I was responsible for a lot of different things at Jus TV I wore a lot of hats and out of all the responsibilities I had guess which one was the most annoying I'll give you a hint it rhymes with bordering brunch now Justin TV was an extremely opinionated about food company I mean these guys I thought at the time it was normal but now that I've seen thousands of companies actually they're in the top one percentile of opinionation about food no seriously we would have email conversations across the whole company 50 emails long about the merits of olives and whether or not they were disgusting olives are highly polarizing I've learned unfortunately I had what Paul Graham calls schle blindness which is where you have a startup idea right in front of your face and you just can't see it and to be fair in 2009 food startups wer really considered a legit thing it's not really something people ever rais money doing fortunately around this time uh the office manager at Dropbox apparently heard that her food had gotten pretty good and she emailed the founder of Justin TV asking for our list the list I had come up with and the same time I was having this conversation with Justin about different startup ideas I was considering and he mentioned this office manager and suggested I helped them out so three months later I quit my job by the way I think this is a really good recipe for startup ideas you know you get a job at the bottom of the totem pole where they throw you all the crap nobody wants to do I guarantee you'll find a hair on fire problem so this is zerocater 1.0 I should say I should say 0.1 you'll notice it's a giant spreadsheet uh you should also notice that Dropbox is on there at 30 people the real lesson of this whole talk is that I should have asked to be paid in equity no seriously that Facebook graffiti gu is worth like $500 million now so for the first website I looked up a couple simple tutorials on CSS and HTML and made something really basic in notepad for the company Menu Pages I made a separate page and each week when I wanted to update their menus I'd go in and edit the HTML and upload it through FTP my sales formula was pretty simple I had a list of companies I wanted to talk to I would look them up on LinkedIn look for second and third degree connections and then ask for introductions now this part kind of sucked and I'm pretty sure everybody I knew got sick of me pimping their LinkedIn connections but there you are so I did this for a year got to $500,000 a year gross sales run rate and everything broke I'll give you an example I was spending 20 hours a week creating invo by hand which is stupid there's no reason to do this but there you are this really sucked so this is the point where I started really looking for a technical co-founder and it took three months but I convinced a friend to join and you know at this point I'd moved to San Francisco and my roommates were getting a little pissed at me for running a business out of the living room so we got our first office it was at Athan Howard and it cost us $200 a month and people smoke crack in the doorway not even kidding so the first thing we did was automate uh this giant spreadsheet into ajango app the second thing we did was automate billing into this into the Django app and we had this beautiful moment where I clicked this button and 20 hours of work happened in 3 seconds oh my God it was amazing so we applied to White commer in the meantime and we got an interview with Paul and Jessica we sat down with them and I I actually think we got it pretty easy we were pretty lucky and that Paul liked the idea right away and uh at one point he asked Jessica how she felt about ordering the catering for all these y commentator events and she said she hated it so we got the call that night we've been accepted into the Winter 2011 class of white combinator so a few months into y commentator I'm talking to the sales manager that I'm trying to recruit and I tell him our numbers and there's kind of a pause and he asked if he can introd if he can introduce us to this VC that he knows and the thing that white commented teaches you about uh fundraising is that it's an all or nothing proposition so we weren't ready to go into fundraising mode so I really tried to push him off but he was really adamant just want to meet meet this guy 15 minutes over coffee okay I'll meet him for 15 minutes so I go and meet the guy and the next day I get an email we'd also like to know if you're willing to go up to a million dollars now remember I was mostly bootstrapped up to this point and my average bank balance for the P previous year was pretty much around around $8,000 so this was a big deal so you've probably heard of startups referred to as an emotional roller coaster and I'll give you a great example one day this guy wants to give me a million dollars the next day my co-founder quit and so I have a friend who has a great saying he says startups are like uh startups du to co-founder relationships what puppies do to socks they try to pull them apart and you know I never really worked with this guy before and I hadn't felt like he was really that invested he didn't like some of the decisions I was making so we parted ways now this happens to about a quarter of companies they lose a co-founder and it's actually one of the most common reasons for a startup to fail this is why they try to dig into the relationship so much in any YC interview so here I was as a single non-technical founder trying to raise money which usually doesn't really go very well fortunately and this is one of my favorite things my favorite thing about startups traction trumps everything and qualifications don't matter qualifications don't matter because if you believe you can go if you believe you can do something you can go out and do it and eventually if you're right people will be forced to acknowledge that so we rais money from a great set of investors uh actually we don't raise money from any of those VCS but they did fund zerocater because they've all used zerocater we find it's less deluding to to to get money for food instead of equity so what's the takeaway for all this we did raise a $1.5 million seed round so what's the takeaway there are some quotes that I really like people have described startups as being like being punched in the face repeatedly pissing blood and my favorite chewing glass now there's a great uh piece of slang from world world World War II and you've all heard it before snafu snafu stands for situation normal all [ __ ] up and that's startups in a nutshell and this is actually one of the most important things to realize because if you start a company you'll inevitably be in a situation where everything is [ __ ] up and you'll probably be in many of those situations and if you don't understand that this is just the way things are you'll probably quit and the most important thing the most the biggest existential risk to your startup is you quitting so that's really the most important part of winning in the long run all right guys that's it um if you're interested in using zerator just email E zero.com we're also hiring for a lot of roles VP of product VP of engineering take care

hey everyone thanks so much for uh taking the time to come listen to all of us speak and really appreciate uh Sam and crew having me over here um today my my goal is to talk a little bit about the early decisions that can make or break a company or sort of Define the trajectory of a of a company within a space um so a little bit more about me um about six plus years ago I started uh my first company I actually joined udemy as a co-founder um it was the vision of two Turkish immigrants um who grew up in a one room Schoolhouse in in Southeastern turkey and uh I met them while they were on their journey and got the opportunity to help them build that company to to what it is today um then about halfway through that time period I I left and went and spent six months at lifts so really just a passer by and that story but had the opportunity to really learn why it was successful and take those lessons and then started spr um how many people here are familiar with sprig fantastic uh for those of you who aren't um sprigg's mission is to make it simple to eat well and our basic belief is that you shouldn't have to choose between quality and convenience that you should be able to push a button on your phone get a healthy locally sourced amazing meal delivered to you now within 15 minutes on average in San Francisco um and uh we just raised around so that we can go and take this Vision to every place in the world and hopefully hopefully end sort of the the terrible choice that we face every day right now in society which is am I going to work hard for my food or I'm going to eat crap um and uh sprig hopes to change that so um one of my my goals here is to talk a little bit about the detailed F like the specific um decisions that we made really early on at udemy and spray that made them successful because if you think about it both udemy and sprig are an extremely uh crowded or competitive markets I mean they're big markets education and food um and so as a result uh there were a lot of really early strategic decisions that most people didn't really understand at the time right so we had a lot of trouble raising money uh at both companies both at udemy and at sprig because investors didn't understand why these strategic decisions we made at udemy were going to be impactful um and so what I want to do here is just provide a little bit of a lens for how we made those decisions why we made them and uh I'll leave the outcomes up to you to decide so I don't feel like it's totally appropriate and some some of the information's confidential about whether or not these decisions worked out um but they certainly did shape the companies as they are today and so I think like the most important thing to realize is that all of these companies started with a very clear vision and I remember like ask getting asked this question I get this as asked this question about both udemy and sprig and lift too frankly um and it's uh and the questions you know what were you thinking when you first started the company like how has it changed what's different and I've realized now that the answer is always has always been at least for my companies that the vision has never changed and that really we've gotten better at explaining the vision and perhaps we've better defined the details of how that Vision will come to life but the original vision of udemy was always to make possible for anyone to learn anything they wanted and that's something that has always been constant and drove a lot of the original decision on the Strategic decisions that we made and so the major strategic decisions there are three of them that we made at udemy um that today some of them may seem obvious and some of them don't seem obvious and remember that's important one of the most common things about these early strategic decisions is that they always look like hindsight's 2020 they always look kind of obvious 10 to 20 years later but you're going to be in a situation in the future if you're starting a business or you're joining a company which is actually equally as hard to to do um successfully that where you're going to have to make these strategic decisions when it's not obvious so that in 10 years it is um and the three ones at udemy were you know whether or not we should be live or recorded paid versus free open versus closed I'll talk about them in more detail so at udemy one of the initial things that was super interesting was as I mentioned I joined the company in fact the company had over 100,000 lines of code and was around for about three plus years in some format or the other in sort of turkey actually uh um before I ever got my hands on the product and got an opportunity to work on the company and so by nature of that uh my co-founders who were both Engineers had built this or at that point they had built this beautiful live education platform it was at the time and I think maybe even to this day the most robust live online education platform um in existence it was completely Flash Bas which at the time was of course a a really smart decision um it's since been killed by Apple in some ways but uh it was Flash Bas it could support multiple video cameras it had a beautiful whiteboard and a presentation and it had an extensible infrastructure for applications on top of it and so this was an incredible effort imagine these two two guys from Turkey who have been slaving away for three years building a live education platform and I went and tried to sell this platform cuz that was my job I was the business co-founder who had talk to customers and sell it and I spent months and months and months trying to sell instructors on coming on the platform and teaching courses on you to me and this is the first lesson of any successful company which is that the only way to really know whether or not your idea works is to interview and Pitch customers I tend to do it in two ways either one I'm discovering information by interviewing customers or two I'm actually literally just pitching customers trying to get them to use my product and getting some level of early traction and witnessing people and trying to use some sort of soft skills to figure out whether or not what they're doing is right and so one of the big early decisions that I made was and I said this hundreds of times before we ever did it but was like I want you to kill the live platform like it's only going to be recorded and at the time there were dozens of online education companies and not a single one of them believe that recorded was going to be the future and the reason why I had that Insight was because I said Hey Nobody's teaching on these live courses like I could not get traction on live courses and so I begged my co-founders and actually they agreed to be honest so it was one of those things where it was just like you know prioritizing on the product road map um to build a lot an offline component sort of an asynchronous component where you could post videos on you to me we ended up making the decision to post videos and I was able to get traction on a couple early video courses and that defined the company in a lot of ways from a synchronous live online education Marketplace which clearly didn't work to an asynchronous video Marketplace which was one of the biggest early decisions we made that was fairly painful at the time um and then the second thing that we had to decide was whether or not to go uh paid versus free uh yeah um was to go paid versus free and this was a really tough decision and even today if you look at companies like code cademy or corsera or Udacity or KH Academy there are dozens of online education providers that have decided to go completely free and so I want to tie this back to the Mission Again the mission of udemy was always to make education open and accessible and I think it was very very easy for the press and for sort of the um emotions of decision makers involved in this to say if education's going to be open and accessible it should be free um and at Udu we decided to charge for courses and we decided to enable charging and the reason was because we felt like we understood the marketplace better than anyone else and our view was that actually if our goal was to make education open and accessible the only way to do that would be if instructors were going to make money and so our view it wasn't paid for selfish reasons so that we could make money it was paid because that was the only way to increase the library of courses that we had at udemy and by dramatically increasing the library courses we were increasing the amount of available to Consumers to to learn from and so today Udi has you know tens of thousands of courses on the platform it's probably the largest online course Marketplace on the internet certainly one of certainly the most successful financially um and that was a large part of the fact that we decided to go paid mostly because of the same reason why the Kat Academy was free like our view is five minute videos on YouTube were not actually teaching people a whole lot but 4 10hour course you know four to 10 hour courses online with a small Financial cost would actually be better for people and so we ended up making that decision and it was huge for the company and then the final thing is open versus closed and so another thing about the KH academir or corsera Udacity was this idea that like only only Ed only Elite professors or Educators could be good at teaching online and you know one of the big decisions at unimi very early on was how close do you make an educ marketplace right certainly if you're you know eBay or odesk or Kickstarter you're going to have different views on open or closed and it's important to recognize that actually every Marketplace needs to take a different stance based on its specific Market that it's in and our Insight in education was hey actually in education uh if you were more open then you're more likely to attract the unexpected teacher in you know in in Barcelona who happens to be an incredible web development instructor but doesn't have a PhD in education or doesn't have a PhD in computer science and so again it was an example of where I think it was so easy and obvious to say like only Elite professors could become po instructors in um in the Pro in you know online and that's what a lot of other our counterparts took and by making it open these strategic decisions had an outsized impact on our scale because now we're able to serve so many more so much more diversity to our customer base um and so I think like in summary it's it's not necessarily the case that it's obvious even today whether those strategic decisions will bear out I mean udem on year five it's got you know billion dollar companies usually take seven to 10 plus years to to Really reach fruition and uh but I think that today we're at least least from what I know almost certainly one of the strongest players in the marketplace in online education and the main reason for that was making decisions based on this idea of hey how do I deliver upon my mission in the most productive manner um and I think that's really powerful now the next thing is sprig and I'll talk a little bit about sprig sprigg's mission was to enable anyone to get a hot healthy meal at the touch of a button and really what it was was just about making access to sort of quality meals available to anyone anyone on the planet and this was particularly interesting because it wasn't that long ago and the and the the sort of war is still raging on um I think like one of the interesting things about sprig is that and and the same thing is some somewhat true for you to me but I think it's much more true for sprig businesses are about customers like consumer businesses if you're working in a consumer business SAS business too frankly uh B2B business too but if you're in a consumer business the customer wins it's a democracy like at the end of the day the company that's going to be the most successful company in a given space is going to be voted on by the people who actually buy from that customer B from that from that product the reason why that's important is because I feel like so many entrepre entrepreneurs and lots of second tier investors today are always looking for the easy way out what's the business that's going to make me the most money tomorrow what's the business that sort of like provides a good unit economics and so I'm going to pay $10 today for a user I'm going to get $12 back in six months and I'm going to make money off of that user forever right and the the problem with that is that markets don't play out over 6 to 12 months and if you take a snapshot of any one business at one period of time over the course of 10 years it may look really really attractive on the inside but consumers decide whether or not businesses are successful and so I think that's a completely the perverse way of looking at businesses Uber is not amazing because Uber said hey like you know we're going to be a distributed Marketplace that has this beautiful sort of like 20% take between supply and demand Uber was successful because they did whatever it took to deliver the customer a car within five minutes or three minutes now because they believed that that was what was going to make customers the most value and so in every space there's some really really hard thing that you have to do and take on as a Founder in order to achieve the long-term results that you want and so at sprig we had three very difficult things that we decided to take on that nobody else that almost nobody else took on all three of these things and I think that's one of the like interesting lessons so the first part of this is eliminating friction so our view at you at sprig is that when it's a daily recurring habit something like food that the easier it is to transact in that in that or in that um product or sorry in that market the more likely you are to win and the best example is McDonald's right McDonald's the most convenient meal on the planet um also the most successful food franchise in the history of of of America um and our vision was that friction was hard was the most important thing now you look at the food space today and everybody else has decided to go against that why do door Dash and Postmates have couriers that pick up from restaurants there's two reasons one obviously I mean there there are many reasons and there's many valid reasons for this this isn't to denigrate another competitor it's really just to show you what my philosophy is My Philosophy is that just because it's an easier business model to have restaurants make the food and it's an easier business model to have 1099 contract workers go and pick up the food from one place and drop it off to another so you can wipe your hand cleans of the trans clean of the transaction that's not what matters it does not matter whether or not your business looks pretty on the inside what matters is whether or not consumers really love your product and whether or not you're delivering the product that 10 years from now is going to dominate the market so we take on a ton of pain like sprig is by far one of the hardest businesses to run in the ond demand economy space right we build we make all of our own food we have to control control the entire supply chain from the time it comes to the Farms from the time it grows on the farms to the time it gets to the customer's door and then we have to figure out how to deliver that food to you in 15 minutes hot and you know that's the pain we decided to take on because when I look at the food space I say what's going to happen in 10 years in 10 years nobody's going to push a button and wait 45 minutes to an hour and a half to get food from a restaurant down the street that's putting a ton of butter in their food and oil so that you eat it and are addicted to it that's just not the future and so one of the things we believe in at sprig is we will take on the pain so that you have a great experience right and I think that's one of the examples of something that that I really get frustrated with when I meet people who are building companies who are always like well the margins are so great I'm like the margins like like what are what are we trying to do here are we trying to build a business that's going to sell you know $10 million revenue and and make 80% evida like that's not interesting to me like my goal as an entrepreneur is to change the world and to be a iconic and build iconic companies and that requires doing hard work and the hard work that Amazon and Google and Uber did I think are great examples so you take I already talked about Uber I'll talk about Amazon everyone else in the e-commerce space when Amazon was starting out was saying was trying to do a distributed model almost everyone what I think Amazon and Bezos recognized was that 5 to 10 years from now you're the the customer is going to be able to order something on the Internet that comes to them in two days and now they're looking at one hour right and so Amazon went through the absolutely batshit crazy idea at the time that they were going to build warehouses all over the country and house like hundreds of millions of dollars worth of inventory now probably billions of dollars worth of inventory in these warehouses and then they're going to actually like ship real product to customers like at the time this was an insane proposition today like Bezos and Amazon are much larger than any other company and kicked eBay's ass in frankly um which was the only other company that got to that level of scale in the space because they said we're going to do the hard work and we're going to make this make this business work and we're going to deliver customer ultimate value Google the same way right every search engine was saying well we can't figure out how to make search work so we're just going to give you a directory and Google said no like actually it's really really important to make search as easy as possible and even though the algorithms are hard and are going to require building our own data centers and our own Bots that scrape the internet like we'll do the work and so that's that's one thing and the second thing is having a position on what type of what type product and what you're going to stand for so at sprig one of the things we do is we Source all of our own ingredients people don't often know this we don't do a great job of telling the story yet but we actually Source all organic produce and all of our meats are sustainably raised free range hormone free antibiotic free um and we personally know most of the Farms from which we Source uh and the reason for this is that we believe in 5 to 10 years people are going to get far more educated about food and are going to care a lot more about what they eat and realize that the addiction we have to sugar in America is is counter is is just as bad as an addiction to cigarettes or cocaine and so as a result we made a long-term bet at sprig that today I think a lot of investors are like do people really care about this do people really care about health and wellness do people in the Middle America really care about this and we took a very different approach and said actually we think even if not everyone cares about it today they'll care about it in 5 to 10 years and we're going to ride that wave and be on the Forefront of that this is a bet you know I don't know if it'll work out but it's something that we're making I think in large part because we are customer-driven and thinking about what the customer wants and then the final thing I think is that you really can't know something without actually doing the business so when we first started sprig the idea was to build a Marketplace for for for um food our idea was you should be able to open your phone and order a chef from the personal chef down the street or from your neighbor who cooks really good food really good Thai food right or or the Jewish family uh three blocks down who's got an amazing recipe for for monab Bal soup but a lot of people would have taken that vision and sort of because of their ego associated with how focused they were on their vision and their view of the market and would have just charged forward and you see lots of companies and lots of Founders who are incredibly ego-driven about how they make decisions and so they don't really listen when they're in the marketplace and so what we do I think at sprig that we've done quite well is actually we look at this and say I you just heard me say I wasn't sure if the organic bet was going to work like there are very few Founders out there who will say that publicly and that's ridiculous the best Founders and the things that I've learned at least in my career is that the best Founders have no ego and so whereas we thought it was going to be a Marketplace and we started executing on it we started executing on a Marketplace we started working with many different chefs and pretty clear pretty quickly by serving chefs food from all different places around the around San Francisco we realize that most chefs are really really bad and that it's not a profession where the like 90% are better than the 10% which is the exact opposite of udemy by the way in our opinion right in our opinion udemy leveraging the 90% was the best way to surface the best cont content because there's no real cost to having an additional online course uh but at sprig right if we serve you bad food you're not going to come back and so as a result we actually ended up switching from a Marketplace to a Consolidated model where we make all the food again owning a kitchen building out the supply chain dealing with all the hassles of making real food and managing a 100 person sort of culinary team about 60 right now I guess um and I think that was another key strategic decision that we made uh that sort of really informed what sprig was about so I guess my point is that overall when you look at companies in the early days you'd be shocked by how much these core strategic decisions Define the potential success of a company and I would recommend a to make sure that you're always questioning those strategic decisions in case someone else in the market proves that you're wrong and actually like their their idea is better than yours and then just go ruthlessly copy them and then on the flip side in the event that you are right and focus on this that it could dramatically allow you and you you have to be patient with some of those bets because over time you'll see that those bets will will lead to outside outsize results so that's sort of a little bit of the story of udemy and sprag um and I want to open it up for questions come on down for questions hi you talk about having a very clear Vision at the outset and that hasn't really changed over time and yet you also talk about how you're very open to changing tactics um so have you come across situations um where your V initial Vision has changed and and and how and what was the trigger for that if that's the case yeah so I think it's important to recognize that the original mission statement or vision of a company is tend tends to be really really Broad and so it's the type of thing that's hard to change right like like wanting everyone to be able to have access to healthy food is sort of the type of thing that could have a hundred different variations to it and so actually like I think the point of that statement was that you know no actually like at udemy and sprig we've never changed what we've been trying to do we've just changed how we're going to do it and we're so maniacally focused on the vision actually or the mission that we don't care about how we get there and that's actually what's most important is that the process by which you get to the end result is far less important than the end result itself and so if you guide Yourself by the end result you're much more likely to succeed and find the right product because you're most likely wrong about the first product you come up with hi I was hoping you could talk a little but you talked about um the supply chain for the food what about the logistics of delivery and you know making sure it arrives hot um do you feel like you've taken any shortcuts there because ERS break all the time and it's always there very quickly and I don't know how you do it it's really hard um so there's really two things that sprig does That's Unique um the first thing is that we have a culinary science team that BAS basically tries to figure out how to deliver food well okay so delivering food is a difficult challenge because there's all these factors that you have no control over right traditionally food is made to be served right after it's made and served on your plate and the delivery method whether it's the fact that you have a third party in between the chef and the and the customer whether it's the fact that you're going through a car is a difficult process and so we focus really hard on that and we test every meal that we make in advance to see what delivers well and even then I'm sure if you're a spread customer you know we miss sometimes and uh so we're constantly focused on that the second thing is how we deliver the 15minute SLA and what we do is we build a real-time system that can deal with routing and inventory management in real time and again like if you compare us to our competitors in the space nobody is building a real-time system that's at the level of complexity of sprig uh and simultaneously M trying to figure out how to make food that actually delivers well in fact you'll almost hear nobody talking about these problems as problems that they're dealing with and that's kind of the point right so how does sprig deliver so quickly it's because we have a a team of you know eight Engineers two PhD data scientists who Focus all their time on the real-time algorithm that makes sure you get your food quickly and every time we screw it up we beat ourselves up like crazy about it and people go around the office like depressed it honestly feels like a lot of times that BR that we're not like on track to become a billion- dollar company and we're actually going to fail the next day because people take it so personally and they're so focused and so hard on themselves on actually delivering the customer the best value that we like we we hate it when you don't have a great experience and as a result like you see that in the outcomes which is that actually today it's very very rare to get a delivery time over 35 minutes I mean it's you know a few percentage points oh um sorry that uh yeah we I mean we use contract uh delivery delivery folks as well as any as other on demand services and so we pay them on a per delivery basis so they make uh and that's one of the reasons why it matters to be so quick because they get they make more if they uh deliver if they're able to deliver more meals hey great talk uh um so I've been recently become interested in this idea of the eagle entrepreneur who finds a mission that's Creed themselves and it's no longer should I do this or should I do that it's what furthers the mission um and I read AIT bit about Elon Musk who um one of the reasons why employees respect him is because he has a picture of Mars and then picture right next to of Mars terraform but he has no pictures of himself in his offices and so when you are egoist as an entrepreneur and you draw from sources like the customer or or the business or what what's best for the business or what's best for the customer it seems like your greatest source is the customer can you relay a specific story where you found the customer wanted something just like kind of like job said well if you deliver what the customer wanted you would have given a course or something what was when you backtracked against that um and you went against what the customers were saying in the market yeah I mean almost all the editions I talked about just now like if you take the live versus recorded one I mean most people would ask you that they would prefer live online education to recorded online education so the reality is taking your ego out of it is not about being submissive to the customer it's merely about listening and not letting your own like selfworth be tied to the idea you have so I don't think being egoist is about like oh like it's not about being selfless right that's different I mean I have that value too but that's not the important value for an entrepreneur the important value for an entrepreneur is to realize that decisions are EX extremely challenging and that every decision you make is fairly important and so you should be willing to change and Backtrack on those decisions if they turn out not to be moving in the right direction and the quicker and more efficiently you make decisions and then change decisions when they're wrong the better off you are at achieving long-term results hey I was actually kind of curious if you've looked at automation for sprig and where you think that may go in the future with drone delivery robotic chefs other things along those lines yeah I mean our mission is to make it some simp to eat well right so if drones make it simpler to deliver you food one day that may happen I think it's very clearly farther away than everyone thinks I mean VR and drones are the new hot thing that everyone's talking about you know there was a time where we were all talking about flying cars I mean there is a very reasonable possibility that this becomes real but I try to focus more on 5 to 10 years out and wait for the science to catch up with reality there and so if it happens like we will immediately go and try to figure out how but I think that's you know it's it's much further away Than People realize at least that's my perspective for now hey thanks everyone appreciate it

What metric do you use to decide when to start scaling? How long until growth started actually taking off? Walker answers these questions in his Hustle Con talk.

Walker Williams is the co-founder and CEO of Teespring, a platform that enables anyone with an idea to design and sell t-shirts. Think Kickstarter for t-shirts. Teespring is a Y-Combinator grad with $56.9m in funding, 200+ employees, and $100’s of millions in revenue.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

Recorded at Hustle Con 4/24/2015 in San Francisco - http://www.hustlecon.com/

[Music] [Music] how many of you guys in this room have actually heard of Teespring before Oh that's a good number all right there we go that's way way higher than usual I'd love to see that progress uh for those of you who don't know who we are Teespring is an entrepreneurial platform we allow people to bring products and launch brands in the market without cost risk or compromise uh so in 2014 as Sam mentioned we shipped over 7 million products one in 50 Americans bought a Teespring product uh and more exciting for US 20 people became millionaires on the service hundreds made six figures and thousands now make a living uh and so what we're aiming to do is change the way that people think about what it takes to go from idea to product in the market by essentially removing things like manufacturing Logistics customer service everything that we kind of consider uh that that we can abstract uh but when I think back to three years ago when this was really just an idea uh two crazy college students in Providence Rhode Island had that everybody we asked thought was stupid uh and I think how we got that initial traction and momentum and sort of what were the the biggest contributing factors to to it it really comes down to the fact that we did whatever it took uh but put more eloquently we did things that did not scale we didn't plan for the millionth user on day one all we focused on was the next order of magnitude uh and so you know as a startup you have a lot of disadvantages versus larger companies in competitors you don't have as many people you don't have nearly as much money you don't really know what your pro is even going to be in 12 months it's not as featur there's all these disadvantages but there's one significant Advantage enormous advantage that people massively discount and that is that you can do things that don't scale and I Define doing things that don't scale as growth strategies that are fundamentally unsustainable that will break at a certain point and normally they break around uh Founders not having enough time in the day some times they break around profitability you know it costs a certain amount of money uh and the more you scale the more that money C the more it costs the more you lose uh but fundamentally they just will not take you to the millionth user and I'm here to argue that this is the largest advantage that you have as a new company and the more that your company grows and you start to see these competitors come out and move really fast be more agile than you're able to be the more you'll realize uh how valuable this was in the early days there's three places that I I recommend that you maximize this advantage that's recruiting early users and when I say early users it doesn't have to be the first 10 users we used the same strategies to recruit users up until we were doing uh millions of dollars a month in sales uh to turn those early users into Champions every great product has Champions they're fundamental to building a great company and then finally finding product and Market fit so how you can use this agility and being able to do things that don't scale in the early days to figure out what your product even should look like and should be so recruiting early users I always have to start out by saying that there are no silver bullets in user acquisition uh or in in the vast vast majority of cases there are not and what I mean by that is that it's it's human nature that when you launch you want to look for that easy path to success and and from the outside looking in at a lot of comp and I hear this when people look at Teespring and it looks like an up and the right curve uh it seems like it was so simple that something just went and a fire start and it went so you look for a similar strategy as a business you look for an sem uh strategy you're going to pay five bucks you're going to make $10 it's going to grow and you're going to be a huge business overnight you look for having a sort of viral Loop and every user brings in two users it's just going to explode but for the vast vast majority of us and for every great company that have had the chance to speak to the founder of the reality is that getting the first users will take a significant amount of time and effort uh and that's from early employees and Founders and that can mean a lot of different things for us it was you know I I prefer to be in the realm of design user experience and so this act of sort of hustling was sort of foreign to me and it was a transition for me to realize that the most successful thing that I could do to grow our business was not to f Focus down on incrementally improving the product but rather get on the phone and every single day I would try to make as many calls as possible within a 4our span before I ever got into Photoshop or anything or or started coding or anything else that I could look at uh but that spending that time is just absolutely fundamental and it comes down to the fact of you don't want to focus on Roi for your first users you want to focus on growth by any means possible and I I visualize this by if you think of like a perfect Hill and you're trying to push a boulder up that hill the first couple steps the incline is the steepest it's the hardest you're pushing as hard as you can it takes time and then over time you get things smooth out a little bit and you keep pushing you keep pushing and eventually you reach the peak and the boulder starts rolling on its own but it is going to be hard work to get that movement started and to reach that Peak so in the early days of Teespring I think any investor anyone looking in would have thought it was a miserable business uh we launched and the first clients we went after were local nonprofits and it was taking weeks of meetings you know iteration after iteration of designs we were driving back and forth dropping off samples uh when orders did come in we would have to actually go and call the printer and manually organize all the details it was hundreds of man hours for every hundred t-shirts sold so we would make ,000 for probably a hundred hours of work uh which again seemed entirely unsustainable and we heard it a lot from investors early but for us the most important thing was giving our users a fantastic experience and making sure that every single person that touched our service walked away happy so that if they heard the name Teespring they would be an advocate and one of the one of the great things about this is it's sort of a necessity to grow that you give this white glove Service uh so Paul Graham who uh was the founder of Y combinator but also had a company called via web which eventually became Yahoo stores in the early days very similar to Teespring they built this sort of do-it-yourself store Builder technology launched it only to realize that nobody was going to give them the time of day to actually use the product so it ended up that their team they would have to go out and sort of Consulting ask uh go to these people and say hey we'll just build it for you we'll use our own technology just tell us what you want and we'll do it all for you and giving that white glove service it's it's almost demeaning to an extent because you put your heart and soul into this product and yet here are people saying ah it's just not worth my time can you just do it for me uh but at the end of the day that white glove service breeds Champions and champions are for me sort of the lifeblood of a great company uh a great example of going the extra mile to recruit those early users is Reddit so in the early days Alexis and Steve when they they wanted to have these meaning discussions and yet there just were no users on the site so when new users came in who were they going to talk to and so they actually went out and created dozens of fake user accounts and fake personalities and had the dis had like debates between themselves on every single link which seems crazy but now they they're spending all this time actually using their own service but now a new user comes in and here's the thoughtful debate that they were looking for and it bred these users that were Champions and up to a certain scale where eventually they didn't have to be there anymore the users were engaging with what they had seated astroturfing there you go uh so the the next big thing is is turning users into Champions and what I mean by a champion is a user who not only uh uses the product or as a customer but is also advocating for and uh you know talking about your product to other users or other potential users I should say and this is a fundamental part of being building great companies I I have a something I I I tell people who are just getting started which is you want to build a painkiller not a vitamin you want a product that doesn't a vitamin incrementally improves your day it's certainly valuable but if you go a week without your vitamin you're not really going to notice a significant drop off in quality of life now if you need painkillers and you miss a painkiller for a day your your whole quality of life shifts so you want to build a product that people fall in love with and one way and and need and one way to build that sort of product is to engage the early users in the most uh White Glove service where the founder is reaching out asking them how it's going getting their feedback hearing their suggestions go to where your your competitors cannot with that personal level of service uh and at the end of the day it's about delighting users with experiences they'll remember memorable experiences and the easiest way to do that is to Simply talk to your users and and I know this is something that you hear all the time it's sort of a maxim of startups it's a tenant of Y combinator it's everybody says talk to users talk to users and yet when I go in and I and I look at early companies often times while they know they should be talking to users there's a difference in in theory and reality uh and it's usually because in the early days of a company things are not perfect right fundamentally if you're moving as as fast as you should be your product is going to be a little bit broken a little bit wonky there's going to be things missing and sometimes talking to users is painful because they tell you what you're missing and they say ah you know I'm going to I got to leave because you don't have these things or it keeps breaking or whatever it might be but talking to users is the best way to build a meaningful feedback loop and understand where the pain points are you need to get good at at filtering out sort of noise versus signal but this is still today every single night when I get home I spend 3 to four hours looking through every Facebook Community uh that talks about Teespring there all these amazing entrepreneurial communities of people discussing strategy I read every single tweet about Teespring good and bad and there are absolutely bad and try to make it right I give every single user my email address so that when they have a problem or they hear a buyer writes them an email and says hey I got a shirt there was a splotch on it or the design was uh the it was slightly off center whatever it might be they can email me directly so I can deal with it and getting that feedback loop is fundamental so so three ways you should be focusing on talking to your users uh one handle your own customer service this is it's it's this is kind of a this is a unique one for me because there's nothing else there's no other service I use in in my entire life where even today so I haven't done c i i do customer service tickets but I don't handle it exclusively now uh every single time I open up our customer service portal I get a visceral like sinking feeling in my stomach from those early days where we I would open it up and I was so committed to trying to build something that people loved and so focused on trying to putting everything I had into this product and yet you'd open it up and you'd hear about these experiences that are totally contrary to what you're aiming for uh somebody bought uh products that were supposed to get there for a birthday and they were late somebody got a bad print something they didn't like it never showed up but we handled Evan my co-founder and I handled customer service all the way until the point where we were doing $200 $300,000 a month in sales and and I think that those early experiences helped guide us to the company we are today we look nothing like the the company that launched and it was listening to users and understanding where we missed and also making sure that we experienced the pain of the negative side of the business of the mistakes we were making so that we were even more committed to making them right the second is to proactively reach out to current insured customers and and I call this one out because it's a mistake that we made uh in in the pursuit of growth you know there's so much like 30 40% month-over-month growth is an insane Target it's it's it's ridiculous for a business to to have that sort of growth and in pursuit of that oftentimes you start to forget about your current customers you uh you you're you're so eager to bring the next person in that you forget to look back and say hey how are you doing now that you've been with us for three months or six months and the same thing for churned customers it was years before we started realizing and tracking and reaching out to people who tapered off or stopped using our service uh and yet a simple conversation just reaching out and say how are things going or reaching out to a customer who stopped using the service and saying hey uh I I saw you I saw you canceled I saw you left did something go wrong is there something that we could talk through I love the feedback that can be the difference between a a user walking away and building a user who knows that it's going to get better who's going to work with you who's going to give you feedback towards improving who becomes emotionally invested it's time out of your day and there's a million things that that you need to be spending time on but it's that small touch that can build Champions uh so listening in Via social media and communities this depends on what kind of company you are but uh I I would Define that more as trying to listen into third party streams of communication so anything where people don't really know that you're listening because then you can see this kind of unfiltered stream of feedback in in any way you can uh and so again that goes back I I'm I'm OCD about reading every comment every post every tweet about Teespring and there even the bad ones and then uh you know there's emails that go to Team at teespring.com angry emails so uh so a really good example of a company that that went the extra mile to build Champions is Airbnb so in the early days of Airbnb this Behemoth this amazing company uh they were struggling it was a ridiculous figure they were struggling to get any traction and get off the ground and so what they did is first they went to New York City where their users were and they did two things one they started hosting meetups with this very small community buying people drinks going to bars learning what people were actually thinking saying and wanted from the experience and then when they heard from customers who were renting airbnbs that the quality of the photos and the listings weren't exact exactly giving them confidence that they could sort of this was something they wanted to do they went out and hired professional photographers and professional writers to go out there and actually make each of the listings beautiful so that it did Inspire that early confidence and got those early users now is it sustainable to have to fly a professional photographer out to each apartment listing and have them sort of professionally uh professionally shoot it as well as do having a writer review the listing absolutely not but it got them those first few feet up that hill and then the boulder kept rolling uh and the problems are inevitable in a startup just by nature of the fact that you're building a new company problems happen every single day at Teespring there are things breaking there are customers that have bad experiences it's not so much whether you do have problems it's what you what you do when they come and how you react in the early days of Teespring we made a conscious decision that we were going to do everything we possibly could to not let people walk away with a bad experience and it there were points where you know again you in in the very early days the money is not unlimited you are absolutely you can't really afford to do it we had users where uh we'd ship something out and the color would be a little bit off or the size would be a little bit wrong or there'd be just something slightly wrong and your inclination is to say well it's you know it's almost there like I it should be fine uh sometimes this was like half a month of gmv and we just could not afford to lose it but we had made that decision and in all of those early cases we would go and we would either completely replace or completely refund every single order on the purchase and a side effect of this is we made it so painful to make mistakes that when a mistake did happen the whole company sort of rallied together and made sure we put practices into place that it wouldn't happen again so the last thing I want to talk about is finding product and Market fit and I know hustle con is is more focused on folks that are non-technical but this absolutely applies to you as well uh so the product you launch with will almost certainly not be the product that finds Market fit and what I mean by that is you need to wiggle your way into finding what your company will look like what your customer base is going to be uh what features you're going to need whether you need something that's robust and handles power users or really simple to handle a great funnel and have novices have a great experience you're not going to launch with a a perfect picture of what the company will become and so in in knowing and accepting that your job is to make sure that you stay as agile as possible so that you can find what will be your company as you grow and it it it comes down to the fact you need to iterate as quickly as possible to find fit uh and so as an example in the early days of Teespring we were going after these small nonprofits and then there were these kind of big behemoths of of companies and nonprofits that came in and said hey you've got something interesting here we'd like to use it but you know we have teams and and branding requirements and all of these things that need to be better handled for us to do this and I sat down with Evan and we looked at it and we said well we can do this but we build this the right way it's going to take a month and and a month doesn't seem like a lot of time but in startups you're sort of living in dog years a month is a ridiculous amount of time for anything uh and so instead of actually building the feature out the right way what we did is duplicated the code base duplicated the database hacked the ugliest code you'll ever see just to make it work put it out to those Enterprise users and we did it in four days and within a month we found that those weren't going to be the right customer for us at that time and we were able just to completely uh Sunset the product and we didn't have to worry about it didn't impact the core product we didn't burn a month and we figured out very quickly uh the profile of who our users would be so optimize feed for Speed overb building scalable technology again this is your baby you're putting your heart and soul into this product you want to build it the right way you want to build it the way you picture it in your head uh but the reality is it's far more important to get something out there listen to the users and use growth as a compass when you feel users pulling you in a direction you can move towards it it's called hill climbing uh and and it really is I would say one of the reasons we're here our user base today which are entrepreneurs who come up with ideas and Brands uh influencers like YouTubers who use Teespring to monetize people that use Facebook advertising Twitter advertising Pinterest ads now we had no concept that those would be successful users we thought it was college kids and nonprofits and had we launched with a product that was fully optimized for those verticals I wouldn't be standing here today and I don't think this company would exist uh and so for us the take that lesson of MVP to the extreme and anytime you want to try something or you want to build something always think about the fact of of how do I get this done as quickly as humanly possible uh so that I can find out if it's right for us or if it's not right pivot it again a great great example is stripe so uh we use stripe I'm sure a lot of you guys use stripe for those of you that are accepting payments uh stripe in the very early days when they were trying to figure out what they needed they had this API that looked beautiful and literally every single transaction that came in there was somebody who was on the phone calling the transaction in there was no interface layer between orders actually being accepted in the service and placing those orders out uh so a huge company that started with sort of the man behind the curtain strategy of why go and build the the transaction the automation layer when we're just trying to figure out what our users want a rule of thumb is to only worry about the next order of magnitude so when you have 100 users worry about what the company looks like can it survive to a thousand a thousand 10,000 and so on and so forth if you're worrying about the millionth user and their experience and how your technology is going to scale when you have a 100 users you're you're pointed in the wrong direction and the sort of my belief anyway is that uh you'll survive uh if if your company does so well and users fall in love with it and you hit those traction points and you grow the way that you want to grow and the technology starts to break or crumble or servers start to crash and I'll give some some examples of this you'll find a way to survive I I call those like quote unquote rich people problems you know if if you're able to actually get there deal with those problems problems when they emerge don't try to solve for something that doesn't exist now because again you'll end up building beautiful scalable technology with a product that people don't want uh and so some some sort of notable examples everybody remembers the fail whale Twitter had a nightmare of a Time scaling uh but because they had built a product and found traction their users stuck with it and uh less than notable example is Teespring so we followed the lessons of MVP and agil and don't worry about technical debt and lots of duct tape code to an extreme degree and for almost uh a year during when we really sort of caught fire and started to grow quickly we couldn't really push out any features because we were so in the weeds of firefighting and trying to scale there was about a six-month period where Teespring would crash every single day and we would all go to sleep with our phones on and like under the pillow and every single night all our phones would go off and you'd you know wake up and lumber over and and restart the database but you know what it was worth it and what I have if I could go back would I have built the technology the right way the first time no because I would have built the wrong technology so don't worry about what happens when you hit that millionth user worry about how you're going to find growth in Market fit so again doing things that don't scale is is a fundamental Advantage you have uh and it's something that again I will argue is one of the biggest advantages that small companies have you can provide a level of service and you can have a level of agility that larger companies cannot and that allows you to outperform them small teams can run circles around big teams and it's something that we deal with today now looking at smaller companies and competitors where the speed that we want to move at they're able to be more flexible because they're dealing with several uh they're dealing with much smaller user bases so don't give it up until you are absolutely forced to even today I do lots of things that don't scale there are positions where you need to make tradeoffs uh you know I was the catchall email address for a long time until it started to take like four hours a day at Teespring and so I had to give that up but don't don't get to a point where you find that initial traction and throw away the lessons that got you there uh continue to speak to customers continue to be as agile as possible with your technology uh relish the advantage that you have and one day when when you guys find uh when you grow to the size that that uh that you're looking for and become the companies you're looking for you'll look back on this and wish you still had that agility uh so so thank you guys so much I appreciate the time and yeah looking forward ask answer [Applause] questions thanks Walker we'll take one question oh is that that's that's slow okay so I was wondering you're talking about kind of a pivot point if things aren't really scaling too well or just not going on when do you throw in the towel sure it's a really hard choice so I had a company before Teespring where we ran into that where you know you have to make uh well I'll take an example from Teespring so when when you release products if you're talking to all of the users especially first you should follow users to the products you should build use growth as a compass I'm a fundamental believer in that philosophy allow users to pull you towards what you need to build uh throwing in the towel is really when you find that the complexity you know either people demand it for free huge no no or people demand customization in every single implementation that was what we found with the Enterprise uh but a lot of it comes down to Instinct you know I I think that starting a company there's a lot of points at which you need to sort of roll the dice and go off of your instinct there's points during the first year where I absolutely thought and looking back it looks you know it looks smooth it looks easy but there were points in that first year where I absolutely thought about hey maybe this company won't won't make it maybe this isn't a business model that works and we considered throwing in the towel and that same thing for Enterprise so I think it's an instinct call uh you have to see how the customers are reacting and make a decision about whether or not that's actually going to be a viable vertical all right thank you so much guys appreciate it

Have a product and need to get in touch with big name companies to make deals? The founders of Back To The Roots explain how they did it. 

Nikhil Arora & Alejandro Velez founded Back to the Roots in 2009 as seniors at UC Berkeley. They’ve created two award-winning products: the Mushroom Kit and AquaFarm. Both are sold in over 10,000 retailers, including Whole Foods, Nordstrom, and Target.

Back To The Roots is bootstrapped and in 2012 they sold $5m+ in mushroom kits.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

[Music] [Music] hello helloo how are you guys amazing it's good to be here uh so we're super excited to be here with you guys and thought we'd take some time to share just some fun stories about what we've learned from mushrooms fish poop breakfast cereal and what that taught us about selling in a retail and Retail distribution yeah and to take a quick step back tell you a very summ quick summary of our story we started out of my fraternity kitchen and actually before that we were sitting in a lecture of about 250 people heard you could grow mushrooms on coffee waste led us to then growing some buckets walk that bucket into Whole Foods got 5,000 bucks from our Chancellor and ended up giving up Investment Banking and Consulting to uh instead become full-time mushroom farmers and along the way have now uh through an incredible journey alongside this amazing man uh maybe boy um give me a hug love this and these amazing products which are ready to grow ready to eat products a mushroom farm a water garden a garden in a can and now organic breakfast cereal and breakfast breakfast Toppers that are now sold in over 14,000 grocery stores around the country in Canada Australia and Russia as well so we uh thought we kind of walk you guys through a handful of these products and a handful of the stores we've gotten into and just kind of like tangible stories of how it actually happened and to start off we we want to start off with our main account the first account we ever had which was Whole Foods and I want to go back to those buckets Alex was talking about so here we are last semester in college uh we had just heard this random fact we had met up kind of fell in love this idea of grown food off a waste and planted 10 paint like Lally Ace Hardware paint buckets of mushrooms in his fraternity kitchen and this right before spring break and we come back from Spring Break and what moments we'll never forget and that nine of these buckets are just totally contaminated nasty mold growing on them but one of them like literally that bucket right there was the only bucket That Grew this beautiful crop of oyster mushrooms and by that time we had no background in food let alone you know mushrooms remember Alex was like hey Nick how you trying those like dude there no way I'm trying these I'm like you're trying them there's no way I'm trying them either and so we were like looking at ourselves like what do we do and like what's the best restaurant in town and well Shay penice is pretty close by and um you know L didn't at that point even know what that meant but we're like let's let's take it over there and L walk that paint bucket of mushrooms into shap panise and Alice Waters happened to be there and I think we had our you know our two Berkeley shirts on she actually listened to us for a second and uh gets her head chef over Lally says hey Cal you want to try these and he saute half of them up and she like Al she actually really good and it was kind of that moment like hey that's might we might have something here I and partly we were we were kind of upset at the fact that he had taken half of the mushrooms that we had grown I mean we're like [ __ ] that's literally the only thing that we have and uh but we took that that that bucket that 5 gallon Ace Hardware bucket with half as many mushrooms and we just walked it over to the Berkeley Whole Foods actually about a mile and a half away and first produce guy we saw just went up to the guy and said hey we you know think we figure out how to grow mushrooms on coffee waste and that was actually the story that I was like that's all we've got and then he was like his eyes lit up though and he then calls over his team leader he grabs a few other people gets this bucket right puts it in the middle of the store and then he's like all right we'll shoot us an email well we took that same bucket we were like we don't know if that's actually going to turn into anything we took that same bucket walked it into every single grocery store in like a 15 mile radius from andronicos every andronicos in Berkeley and Oakland we went to Farmer Joe's we went to Berkeley bows at the time there was only one Berkeley B we W walked to Rainbow GR walked at all these other grocery stores and craziest thing is the only retail that actually reached back out to us was Whole Foods we got this email it was a one- sentence email from uh Randy deoman he was the regional coordinator of produce at the time and he just said this is pretty cool here's my cell phone and ended up giving him a call this is from my fraternity room and uh both just put it on speaker ended up talking to this guy for about 45 minutes and we like he's like Alex stop talking to he's like if you figure this out he's like I'm going to blow you up and Foods he's like this is most Innovative [ __ ] I've seen in produce taking coffee waste growing mushrooms he's like I love it just he's like wait what the hell were you guys doing before this we're like uh Investment Banking and Consulting he's like nah give that up give that up so we're like okay and he's like hey I'll make sure this works out somehow and turn that that that buyer belief into into getting a $5,000 Grant from our Chancellor at UC Berkeley and got some buckets got some you know a few more racks got a $800 van to be able to collect coffee waste and started collecting coffee grounds walked around different cafes and picked up every morning would then Harvest a mushrooms sell them at Farmers Market s them at the Berkeley Whole Food stores and Oakland store and yeah and you know so with the Whole Foods too so we started selling fresh mushrooms this is about 6 months after graduated just spent six months trial and erir trying to figure it out finally figured it out and started growing mushrooms like that and you know I was at this moment we kind of realized we're in about 30 Whole Foods just NorCal but saw an opportunity to kind of start taking some of our passions and trying to devel prodcts weather retailers too and it's one step to go into a store another step to kind of try to build that relationship and we had this idea we're like a lot of people are getting really excited about not just what we're growing but how they grow because there mushrooms grow in just 10 days and so we had this idea for this little grow a home mushroom kit and we decided to go and present it to Randy who's our NorCal produce buyer and the first thing we presented him was that bag on the left and imagine that with a sticker we printed on from FedEx and this is H we were in there in a meeting talking about like fresh mushroom production and demand forecast in and had this thing in a bag uh underneath the table like waiting for the perfect moment to pull up you know pull it out and as if it was the next you know Apple iPhone we had just like so much energy around it so we finally end of the meeting take this like Randy we got something to show you and pull out this bag unveil this beautiful mushroom kit and he literally falls out of his chairs that's the most disgusting thing I've ever seen no one's putting a bag of fungus on their kitchen counter and I just you know it was this moment where we kind of realized a was a really cool opportunity have one of our retailers give us that kick in the butt and what's now become a pillar for us is is design and we we got that from our retail and started developing this we and went through this crazy journey of design of how to actually take this concept and make it look good and bring it into homes and um turn that into what is today uh our first main product the gr home mushroom kits you pop it open and in 10 days you get about a pound of fresh mushrooms right out of the box and um this one was unique we put this in in one Berkeley Whole Food store within three months we were n Nationwide with Whole Foods every single store the country and uh at first very exciting you know two guys had never never sold a single thing in a retailer so we thought we had made it at some point we're like dude this is sick like we're in every store it's so easy and then we got displays a little bit like this around the country and and at the same time especially this is about three and a half four years ago get a call again from from from Whole Foods around the country they're like guys you need to demo this this isn't selling we're like what do you mean but you already bought it he like yeah we bought it but come and do some demos dude we're like okay like I guess that's what it takes so it was kind of realization that there's one thing about getting in the store but the other one was about getting it to the consumer and it was us two working we had an 800 foot Warehouse still that we somehow managed to get enough production Nationwide but at the time right away we said all right cool we'll get a flight oneway flight out to Washington DC Nick Hill took the West Coast down LA and we just demoed as soon as the Whole Foods would open until it' close and we'd go from store to store to store we got this we rented this this car on the E sces this purple Hideous Car I was paying $17 a day though was uh most it was amazing and we went I went from DC down to the Research Triangle drove all the way across to Atlanta then drove it all the way back up to Boston New York and then flew back out right after Christmas to be able to uh barely make for the 25th uh uh dinner but I think the reality is I think it's taking so much real effort for us to actually start building a movement around people to be able to say like hey I can actually put this in my kitchen it was hand selling the crap out of these it was one consumer at a time and one grocery store at a time one produce department at a time and now it's been amazing to even see where I think uh about two years ago Walter Rober Co of Whole Foods was like I think Alex and NC visited more Whole Foods than some of our team has and uh so it was very cool yeah and you know as we funny we started growing the Whole Foods and this is kind of jumping to our next retail partner and you know so this is couple couple years ago we had just kind of built out this whole food distribution and at that point still didn't have an office an 800t Warehouse in Emeryville and so we'd go there plant in the mornings and then go actually this is the Emoryville Home Depot and right next to it is a Starbucks so that was our office for like two years with the Starbucks you know opened it up closed it out and every morning we're working at that Starbucks and right across from us is this Home Depot this beautiful lawn and garden center we're like why do these mushroom kids have to go in like how do we get these mushroom gets into that Garden Center and you know after enough thinking and trying to figure it out we're like let's just take that same approach we did with Whole Foods and decided to walk in that that Emille you know Home Depot with with a couple mushroom kits and it was uh funny we asked that that store's buyer to introduce us to his Regional buyer and at that point he's like you guys are two crazy kids trying to grow mushrooms on coffee ground like I can't do that but he did drop his buyer's name and he wouldn't wasn't willing to introduce us because he didn't want to put you know his name on the line for two people he didn't know but he gave us his name and we said that's all that's all it takes there only so many variations of that email address they can be so we tried first name that last name you know that every this first initial last initial literally I think I 20 things he sent over to one of them actually came through and just just an incredible response and Tim was like you're interesting I'm down in San Diego do you want to meet and Alex jumps on the next flight down there and and meets up with San Diego of course yeah things oh of course I'm in town easily and um make the you know not trying to sound desperate at all but make that uh make that trip happen and but literally that that one email address those 20 attempts turned into a meeting with Tim and it's just crazy to see a one meeting one email can start cultivating a relationship and actually just this week riah announced that Home Depot expanded it nationally into 850 stores nationwide um with displays across the country but that started off with a um a cold email to the buy so aquaponics aquaponics that is uh the second product that we created we created a mini aquaponics kit and uh the way we developed actually was out of just mere curiosity we were doing farm tours we ended up uh doing a farm tour with whole Foods in the midwest we went up to Milwaukee and visited this farm that was taking uh and we had never seen anything like have any of you heard about aquaponics oh dang that's a lot that's so I'll say this was about two and a half years ago three years ago so that was even less people at the time I'd never heard of it but I went up to Milwaukee saw this and I was completely blown away it was the craziest thing you were in the middle of one of the toughest areas of Milwaukee and this farmer Will Allen uh was had turned this into this most amazing Urban Farm they were taking all this fish poop pumping it up using it as a fertilizer organic fertilizer for the plants up top so they were growing from lettuce to Basil to Cilantro everything and the craziest part of it all is that that fish [ __ ] was actually the fertilizer for the plants and then the plants were indirectly cleaning the water bringing back down for the fish so it was this really cool ecosystem where the fish would feed the plants plants would clean the water and the system was using 10 times less water less energy and Nick and I looked at this and we were like this is the coolest thing we've ever seen like how come we had never heard of it and we're like can we create the smallest system ever and we got a picture from will uh saying like there's already a kid out there and he sent us this picture of something was like four feet by 4 feet 500 bucks and we were like that is not is not an aquaponics kit and uh we spent uh a big leap of faith is you know injection molded plastic product that uh we' never even you know come close to creating the first one was mushroom farming a mushroom kit but we went out there leap of faith and we made a slight mistake in that we didn't present it to our buyer to begin with and here we just went at it went all in and went back to say show the prototype to Whole Foods and he said this time he's like guys I can't launch this like this is the fish tank go to a pet store and like well how do you do that you know so we we said instead decided to go with Kickstarter we said we had a community that was passionate evangelist consumer through our mushroom kit we had you know we had such and I think we've been building such a relationship by going every single store all those customers had bought the mushroom kits and put this up on Kickstarter we had a $100,000 goal ended up doing $250,000 in 30 days of pre-orders we took that momentum took it over to our website another quarter million dollars so this is half a million dollars of pre-orders without even creating the damn thing so we took that buzz and went back to Petco went back to Whole Foods went back to Nordstrom and for the first time ever those three retailers took this product on Nationwide so we had National launch with Whole Foods National launch with Petco National launch with Nordstrom and Petco actually put a little fish coupon inside because obviously Whole Foods is never going to sell fish or Nordstrom's not going to sell fish and we were able to use that coupon for anybody that bought it anywhere in the country they could go to a Petco and uh but so here you are you know launching into into all these retailers and I think this is a lesson learn we though right away was just kind of still not getting caught up in that momentum and how to say no to buyers to and take the time you need to take it in this case we actually ended up rushing ing our launch in retailers with this packaging and at the time we thought it looked gorgeous we're like it's symbolic it's artistic it hits in stores and we're like people have no clue what this is it's a big red fish on the you know in this like dark little looking tank and wasn't moving wasn't selling we're like crap we just totally bombed this packaging we spent all this time developing a product and now we can't communicate in stores and ended up actually having to do like an urgent rebranding of this packaging and all that Goodwill we had built up with stores now we here we are calling this produce buyer saying can you guys please take these off off the store off the ground and actually putting these new ones in and it was just this crazy learning curve of like how to build momentum at the same time have enough kind of fortitude to say no and take the time you need to take to launch it right and ended up redesigning it to what it is today a much more like bright vibrant colorful packaging that actually stands out and luckily learned that lesson with Kickstarter and Whole Foods who was really flexible with us and learned it in time to be able to to do it right in Costco but that was um it's learning for us about this balance of retail of building momentum and yet taking your time to do it right because you can you make one mistake it can it can put you out so yeah and as we grew distribution and GRE Partnerships to you know we're in a few thousand retailers at the time but more importantly we were starting to build I think just genuine authentic relationships with our buyers directly and you know I think we started to have a voice and and and care about very particular things and we you know develop pillars to what we wanted back to the RO to stand for out in the out in the community out in the world and uh one of the most important things there is we know we really started taking big Bets with our retailers and we approached Whole Foods and Costco and Amazon in particular and and Whole Foods from just the inspiration of how to grow food in a much more sustainable and just better way for the for society and had a had an opportunity to meet with the Executive Vice President of purchasing and sat down with them with the head of uh of produce head of grocery and uh the first thing he said is all right guys go and visit some more Farms learn more about food because you guys don't really know that much yet uh we said okay so we we we took we we took the opportunity to go with local foragers all around the country we ended up going to Farms from Hawaii to Chicago to New York uh one of those was this top right uh that is actually believe it or not that is an avocado it uh over a thousand varieties of avocados in Hawaii and we're used to eating one variety mostly for the most part here a h avocado and uh through learning about heirloom varieties just became more and more Curious more passionate about just how food used to be grown in the past how our grandparents used to eat how they used to cook and all that visited you know saw totally different kinds of bananas these little baby bananas that are huge in India huge in Latin America but you never see them in a grocery store here unless you go to an ethnic market and all that led us to a wheat farm and that Wheat Farm blew our minds honestly one of those moments where you you visit this farm and you see something you're eating every single day probably since the day you're born almost and we quickly realize like we had no clue how wheat actually grew or how it turned like all this food around us you could ask us how a stock of wheat turned into a cracker a bread a cookie we couldn't tell you we were like that's insane and then B we started learning all this crazy stuff what happens to wheat based on our industrial Milling system all the stuff is taken out of wheat all the nutrients the brand The Germ the endosperm it's broken up and we started asking ourselves like how else did wheat used to grow and how else did it used to be Mill and it let us down this this incredible exploration of the last year of visiting all these different like ancient Milling practices and kind of started honing in this really cool practice of was Stone Milling grains where you know 100 pounds of wheat goes into our Mill and 100 lbs of flour comes out nothing's added or removed or fortified or broken apart it's just this really pure you know grain and really pure flour and we're like how can we bring this back to more people today and bring it back to our generation something we were doing 100 years ago and we started looking at all these different categories around stores like where are grains used today where is wheat used today and started really focusing in on this aisle and we're like here's this monstrosity of an aisle right 100y old category 100 years old10 billion industry and there hasn't been any Innovation from packaging to ingredients to branding it's either these really Brown boring granola boxes or these bright pink you know desserts dressed up as a health food and we're like can we bring this Innovation to it and ended up working really hard over the last few months to kind of undo this category like Alex is saying taking it back to to how it used to be done and developed for the first time the first US grown 100% stone ground breakfast cereal made with just three ingredients and packaging it in an entirely new form factor and putting that actually brand new organic stone ground flakes which we launched exactly one month ago now uh alongside a whole new kind of line of convenience customization to the entire category of these breakfast Toppers and it's just been this incredible journey for us of how do we start co-developing these products along side of our partners actually and uh it's led to some really interesting learnings this is literally over the last five weeks yeah this is all happening as we speak so people still a lot of people still think we're nuts we're crazy for going from mushroom farming to fish poo farming to now wheat and cereal making and uh you know through that we've you know as I briefly mentioned we we developed this alongside Whole Foods from the learning of how food grew to wheat farming but we worked with Costco at the same time uh and it was a GMM of of Costco for uh we worked I mean this is a nine-month in the process in the making we worked with Amazon because one of the problems is they're losing so much money delivering this to the home because a cereal box has 40 40 to 50% air so you're shipping half of the the cereal or Salon is being shipped with just air so we worked on having for the first time it's 100% recyclable box but it's also 90% fill rate so you can use 25% less packaging as well but one of the challenges we had is two weeks before we're hitting stores the agmm at Costco ends up retiring and we were like okay whatever we're going to you know continue to this momentum and it fortunately the momentum wasn't fully there they had no idea what was happening and we had two weeks to somehow get her excited about something we had worked on for almost you know 9 10 almost a year with and uh what we did s and what we did know ahead of time is one of our strengths has been demoing we learned it firsthand and uh we said listen like has anybody demoed cereal in in Costco and they're like uh no we've been selling it for you know for 20 years here nobody's ever come in and demo like done like let us demo the crap out of that thing we'll go out there make sure we prove it it's exactly what's happening today and what we've done in the last 5 weeks we are the number one selling organic cereal and coffee Nationwide we're selling right now in the Bay Area but thank you just had the humongous honor of meeting with the daughter of the founder of Costco in San Diego two weeks ago we're going to be launching down in San Diego Colorado Arizona and Los Angeles regions of Costco and it all has been just off trying to find a key opportunity for us was being able to just demo the darn thing and I will say through that it's led us to Foods also being a key partner Walter Rob actually putting it up on stage where hundreds of people there saying that this the cereal could actually change the game with three Goliath post kellogs GM running the show they own 90% of this 10 billion doll industry and uh it's pretty amazing to see his support and you know I we talk about some successes I we can't leave the stage without talking about a lot of failures one of those is Safeway we've been trying in and out we had uh opportunities with the floral buer was super excited launch just completely flopped we tried demoing didn't work and went back to our roots in a little bit you know in some way went back we had C demo the Home Depot by we said hey how about C demo the president this time let's see what happens and got a chance and this is still in the making we still have not a real strong relationship with Safeway but at least that gave us one more opportunity and we're now working with the buyer for produce and uh looking to see if we can do it better we took that same we've done it with Kroger and and uh we're now just met with the Kroger buyer last week we're going to be launching at 800 Kroger in October we cold emo the the the CEO we said hey this is what we're doing we can't wait to be able to partner with you and wrote a really nice note back and ultimately it's just at the end of the day it's just turned into how do we create products that we're so passionate about and get it out to everybody try to find advocates in every corner and if you lose an advocate one way just keep on swinging and that's uh you know I justess to wrap up on this this whole talk right now kind I think if there's one thing to leave you know I think that we've learned it's that number one of all the stuff reaching out finding Advocates finding customers doesn't really matter if you don't stay true to what you believe and that took us a long time to kind of really find that and hone in on it and I think now we feel more clear than ever and for us that's developing products that are you know welld designed with a kid focus and a real big focus on sustainability and you know people ask us how could you launch a mushroom kit a fish tank and now a breakfast toal and I think for us it's because that that underlying theme we've stayed true to and and that's the biggest lesson we've learned is staying true to yourself and for us it's connecting families back to their food and and simplifying it undoing it through this really fun design lens and you know the end of the day though there's there's this you know I think we step back and there's one thing I want to leave you guys with it's that retail and Retail distribution isn't Magic there's no secret sauce it's it's a lot of hard work it's it's like Alex said you got to keep on swinging and finding this Advocates and it's a little bit of luck and at the end of the day it's I think what we always challenge ourselves with it's let's keep on swinging keep on outreaching find those Partners but then once you find them latch on like hell and don't let go and keep on trying to co-develop with them and see what you can do together and I think we're learning firsthand right now that that by going deeper with those Partnerships too can lead to some really incredible things and um we're super excited for this next few years ahead being able to take this brand and expand from what started off as an urban mushroom farm and really try and ask yourself this question like what would craft Foods look like if it invented today by our age by Millennials and with this focus on sustainability transparency and it sounds like a really big question but we think as long as we find those partners and and do it together uh we can hopefully do something pretty exciting and um thank you guys for letting us share this story so appreciate it great thanks guys if you have any questions for them come on down oh they have to come hi guys thank you so much for the talk I really enjoyed it um my question is kind of purposefully broad so please feel free to answer it however you like um I'm curious uh how you look back on this journey that you've been on and obviously uh what strikes me most is that you have such a passion for this and that um that passion has obviously grown right you found out about things that you never thought you would be finding out before like a fascination with flow for example right your investment Baker s are the probably would have thought you were crazy I'm sure being like you're going to be fascinated in 5 years about how flower is made um but obviously at the same time you know growing these mushroom kits there was a Fascination that you guys had with that and I'm just curious how you um think about or how you see looking back what that um like real Fascination was and how you uh we're able to cultivate it um because I think it's something similar to what the Pandora founder was talking about before and like that magic that really can't be you know like bought or like gotten other than just by really feeling it I could just bring up one one one one thing which we we we talked about a little bit but it's just curiosity I would say is at the core to a lot of these things and curiosity in our you know curiosity in banking I love Finance I I I had a true genuine interest in it and and I think you know Nick Hill has had amazing experience himself building different things in college and you know basically valorian of our business school himself through just putting himself out there and asking the questions and I think now as we continue to grow the Big Challenge and the big question we're always asking our team is continue to be curious and I think that leads to so many things uh and that's ultimately What's led to the yeah I think even our brand is quick build off of that is like we've really tried to focus our brand not on this idea especially with food where it's so personal of saying what's right or wrong about food cuz to be friend like we're not smart enough to know that I think it's such a complicated answer we're like how can we build a brand that's not around teaching what's right or wrong it's just about trying to get people curious to ask that question themselves like where do this come from and I think it started off with I think it started off because when you so little about food we it's almost like we didn't know that going into but we knew so little about food starting all we could do is ask questions and now it's turned into this a big part of our brand which just like we got to make sure we're just focusing on education but on curiosity thank you so in the interest of time we'll take just these three hey guys I really like your story um this is kind of like a question and also like a recommendation um because um again I really like to hear guys' story and like it really like I was able to connect with it so I wanted to um ask are you guys interested in like potentially reaching out to Food Network and going on uh what's it called food fortunes it's like shark tank but for Food Network sure more to and to share your story have you guys considered yeah sounds awesome oh okay do you guys like have any plans that you'd like to share with the crowd like with like you know food Fortune wait what to like get on to food fortunes on Food Network are we auditioning now I mean that I think that' be totally cool wouldn't it that sounds like an awesome it's a question and a recommendation I mean oh and the question is do we want to yes absolutely like have you guys considered it and like are any plans and if there are any plans I'd love to hear them oh to go on yeah to kind of like have like your i' never heard of the show that sounds awesome and you totally check it out food fortunes on Food Network food fortun food fortunes it's like Shark Tank okay yeah yeah all right sounds dope cool thank you food fortunes looking at that um so it sounds like you've had a few products where you've just kind of gone out there and done it and you've launched with you know more and less successful designs but have you found any more uh lightweight ways to test whether it's design ideas or product ideas in the offline Market um rather than just kind of going out and seeing if it sells or not great question offline markets meaning uh just online you can do a kind of test see if anyone's you know clicking or having General pickup interest very quickly versus offline you're just waiting for results to come in in terms of sales have you found any so one way I mean we I could talk about I mean in terms of definitely it's very important to us and key I think the Water Garden is a really cool example of putting on a Kickstarter we had no idea we ourselves weren't even sure if we could actually launch this thing if there was a demand for it there was a gut feeling put it out there and that was a really cool way in which we almost you know very much soft launch it where we had the pre-orders before even creating it um even with with a cereal you know we we've gone through so many iterations on taste and flavor to get to where it is today so the cool thing is that even working with our partners we're able to go into demos and stores we're demoing at other products but have these like different variations of cereal and just for months in advance get like taste profiles get gut checks from customers like hey do you like this blind taste test so we've tried to find ways to like Leverage the community we built with other products to now kind of get that gut check earlier because I think even now the larger swings we take that's the more risk too so um like we launched our serial first into Costco and with the water gun we launched on Kickstarter launching this thing first in the cost we couldn't mess up we messed up we were out of business so we had to kind of feel really confident about it beforehand that answers your question hey so I was really interested in um learning a little bit more about the manufacturing process I don't think you've guys touched on that so yeah so yeah two quick glad you asked that's something so so I think but we're so passionate about so we started off actually quick story in terms of one less in terms of finding things you're really good at so we start as companying everything ourselves we wake up literally in the morning collect coffee grounds come back plant the mushrooms Harvest them sell them do repeat rinse and repeat for you know literally a year and a half and but through that way we kind of realized one thing which is that we sucked at growing mushrooms to be frank with you we were not very good at it and you know it's one summer we kind of I think overheated thousands of mushroom kids because we didn't know how to mess with the fluctuation in summer heat just like all these learning curves and along the way with this mushroom farm um up in sebastio Gourmet mushrooms first guys 30 years ago to grow Gourmet mushrooms in North America and they were mentoring us for a while and finally we got to the scale they were like hey it makes sense for us to try to incubate these for you and uh at first we were really hesitant because that was our baby we were farmers we were producing this stuff every single day ourselves we were hands- on with it we knew we knew what we were doing and finally we're convinced to let them try some out and try growing them and the first batch came back quality consistency was just like night and day from anything we were able to do and it was kind of like that lesson learned of like let's find Partners who are better at things than we are and and let them do it and after seeing the success of like finding a partner to grow our mushrooms we've taken that out of all our products and um but the key there is like finding the right Partners you really believe in because the end of the day that's everything you have is a quality of that product and so with the water Gard just last story you know we had it's an acrylic injection molded item and we had Tred to Source all these different manufacturers and 95% of Manufacturers for that kind of stuff are overseas and spent a lot of time trying to find can we find one here locally and actually found a partner in Union City one of the few injection molders um called Jacko who's been just an incredible partner so that product is actually like a 100% us-made um NorCal made thing for an injection molded plastic piece which is pretty rare but uh it's become so cordos like let's find Partners who we can visit we know um and we know who's making it for us cool thanks thanks thanks guys thank you thank you guys

[Music] [Music] hey guys how you doing uh let's all let's all stand up everyone get up you guys have been sitting for about an hour and a half or two hours all right and find someone you don't know and give them the best hug you've had in the last couple days hey you're you're not hugging let let's get this all right all right that's enough hugging you you you guys can find each other on coffee meets Bagel if it was uh all right um so I'm going to talk to you guys about our company how we started um how we've messed up an incredible amount and then kind of what we're building this is a picture of me drinking a gin and tonic I don't know why it's on there but it was a that was a awesome wedding all right so um so raise your hand if you've ever broken a smartphone before all right so that's it's a pretty big Market um so we so I'm one of our own best customers I went to calply with my brother chip who presented last year raise your hand if you were here last year oh come on all right well his talk sucked and mine's going to be way better all right uh so he's a so he's a wine maker but what happened is in college we got cut off by our parents and they're like hey you guys need to um figure out a way to make money so we started a beekeeping operation because the uh margins in Honey are actually pretty high and then um and then so he started we started making wine because we couldn't afford alcohol so we're like why don't we make it and um and then I kept breaking my phone and I'm like we're spending all the money that we're making from selling wine to kids in the dorms on fixing our pH so we need to we need to figure out how to um how to make some more money and and not pay Apple $229 to fix an iPhone 3GS so on the fifth or sixth time breaking my phone I ended up uh ordering the ordering some parts online and then uh took about four hours to fix I broke the phone more than it was broken before taking it apart but um at least I didn't have to go wait in line set up an appointment and have a painful experience and then my roommate was like Hey can you fix my phone it broke and I'm like yeah I'll order another $15 part and then fix it I didn't charge him but I should have um and so I was like this is a really cool business but um I don't have any customers I'm just fixing my buddy's phones that uh go to parties and um and so I ended up going to a career fair and I was walking around and I paid $20 to buy 10 sheets of paper to print my resume on that read like it it was like high school education there was like nothing I'd done I worked at a couple fish stores that was really fun and uh and actually I worked at fish stores because I've always kept saltwater fish tanks and corals were really expensive and I got an employee discount and I worked for $5 an hour and I got corals for next to nothing so that was cool but um and this is actually going to be this is the story gets better so um so I'm walking around and I'm and I remember looking at a Clorox uh Clorox booth there at a career fair at CIA poly and I remember thinking like I'm going to spend a summer working on like marketing or social media for Clorox it's probably not the best use of my time and I end up bumping into um one of my friends who actually just started a company that went through YC which is awesome but I bump into uh a guy and he's like hey you're the guy who fixes iPhones I'm like yeah what's going on he's like can you fix I broke my phone yesterday can you fix it and so I was like yeah actually I have uh I have Parts in my golf cart cuz I had a golf cart in college and I drove it to and from class um we're we're so uh there's another story about how we acquired the golf cart which find me after and I'll tell you it we painted it so you could never guess that it was someone else's golf cart um so I end up I was like yeah I I can fix your phone and I ended up throwing out all my resumés uh before I'd handed out any one of them went and fixed his phone and then I was like hey this could be a cool business so I'm going to need to figure figure out how to um how to make more customers so I I actually skipped class and I went to the library and got on uh Microsoft Paint for those that remember it and made the most terrible looking flyer you've ever seen that's like broke an iPhone uh and I made it in neon colors um and then the cool thing about calply I hope they never watch this but they subsidized color printing at 5 cents each so it's is very cheap and so I I printed um two or 300 flyers and then handed them to my friends and my roomate and I was like when you're going to class hang these up and on the first day I got a phone call being like hey can you uh this is actually there there's a funny story behind this so um I dated two girls named Courtney and um it get good so I dated two girl not at the same time but um but so I dated two girls named Courtney and the first person that called me was like Hey I broke my phone I saw your flyer can you fix it I'm like yeah absolutely what type she's like I have a iPhone 3GS and I'm like all right that's awesome what's what's your name and she's like my name's Courtney and I'm like this is a sign this is this is awesome and so I gave her my address and I said hey uh yeah bring it over I'll I'll fix it later and she walks in and she's like hey I think I've been to your house before I'm like I don't think you have and and she's like no uh Mike lives here I'm like yeah Mike's my roommate she's like oh my brother's best friends with Mike uh his name's Anthony and I was like Anthony Martin she's like like yeah I was like oh yeah I'm good buddies with him and that's actually became my co-founder is let's give a round of applause for Anthony and his [Applause] sister so uh so that was our first my first customer was uh my co-founder sister which was uh which was crazy and so I ended up hanging the coolest thing about Flyers is you can hang them anywhere and there's and if you staple them high enough in the room the janitorial staff for the teachers can't tear them down so we'd go we'd like go in at night or after 6 p.m and then like staple Flyers up towards the clock where it was like 10 12 feet high and they'd never get torn down but every time you're in class you'd look at it and you'd be like oh my gosh I have two hours left and there's an annoying neon flyer next to the clock that's telling me to fix my iPhone and um and so we ended up graduating and uh was thinking about dropping out I still don't know if that was a good idea or a bad idea idea I think the jury's still out on that um but ended up like the more uh customers I would meet and service the less important education and school got and and I was like well I'm a Psychology major I can probably um I can probably get by with graduating so ended up um graduating and the and I was talking to my dad and I'm like hey what are you he's like what are you doing after graduation I'm and I'm like I don't I don't really have a plan I I like I think uh I cracked is is going pretty well and he was like well why don't you do that fulltime and I remember thinking that it had never it always been just like a really cool College job it had never been uh something bigger than that and I think one of the coolest things a parent can give to their children is um permission to explore Adventure um and like go out on their own and so I and like a something switched in my mind I'm like oh my gosh I just got permission to essentially max out my credit cards and start an iPhone repair company which sounded crazy at the time and so um Anthony ended up calling me and he's like hey what are you doing for um what are you doing for uh money and I'm like you need to fix phones and he's like all right cool he he was running a uh textbook rental and exchange company and um and so I just sent him the Flyers we changed his phone number on it and I sent him like a YouTube video on how to fix iPhones and there's actually still a flyer somewhere on Santa Barbara's campus that he gets a call like every two weeks and someone's like hey fix phon he's like where is that flyer and they're like oh it's in the polyi building and then we're like tear it down they're like it's way too high um and and so so that he's it was it became like the absolute coolest uh coolest job I could imagine and after graduation we're like well we need well I'll do I'll go back to a chip story we can integrate those quite a lot he's my wine- making brother so he calls me and he's like hey what are you doing for money I'm like you need to fix phones he's like all right yeah I'll I'll just print it on my business card that is it cool if I say I'm an executive I'm like yeah of course we have three people in the company you can be an executive so he he he prints like business cards that say like wine maker and uh I cracked executive on it and um and I send him up some screens and he goes to a party and he was trying to impress a cute girl and uh and he hits her phone out of her hand uh to break it cuz he's like ah can fix this and so um so he hits he hits the phone out and um and she's like you're an [ __ ] it's a 3Gs and he's like I only have 3G Parts if you remember there's two iods so he calls me in a panic I'm like oh yeah they're you we definitely don't have parts for those and he ended up having to buy her a new phone which was H um and so so that's so it started but it was like what worked on one campus started working on another campus started working in San Francisco and and what it started as I put on demand iPhone repair I think what we'll get to is it's actually not about repair at all it's not even about iPhones it's about uh building a network that you press a button anywhere you are around the world and someone comes and solves your technology needs but uh it started as on demand phone repair and uh the cool thing is we believe that your iPhone is actually the remote control to your life and if you can insert a brand and a service in between between you and that phone you can get into other verticals quite easily because you've already gained consumer trust and um and you've already solve their deepest need which is connection connection to the world and so what what we decided is like how do we create the AAA for your devices and and the cool thing is is we think that repair is a trojan horse into um our consumers lives and it's uh it's going crazy I think I have like 20 slides and I'm on slide two so this is going to be good uh here's a picture that I don't know why it's on there we can go to the next one cool so how it started I was my own customer I still am I fixed my iPhone 6 for the fourth time this year um yesterday actually and I don't like it because the six parts are actually expensive so it costs us a lot of money to fix it but whatever so uh where we are now uh so we're at about 115 employees we have six offices which is insane because uh at graduation date we packed my uh co-founder's truck and we're like hey let's go up to San Francisco there's no way we can build a massive company in San Louis abiso and ended up driving up and crashing on my brother's couch another chip story um so he wine makers are the best so he I'm I'm working with Anthony and we're at our computers and it's like 9:40 a.m. on a Tuesday and Chip like comes out and we've been living on his couch for two months and he's like stretching probably hung over over and he's like H how much do you guys work we're like chip it's 9:40 in the morning you need to get up and but so what we were like hey it's our time to leave so we end up uh Craigs listing a place in Sunnyville and moving into a basement in Sunnyvale and then ended up hiring a graphic designer uh her name's lesie she she saw my Ms paint flyers and she's like these are terrible can I make you uh better ones cuz I have to look at them all day in class and I'm like this is annoying I'm like oh my gosh absolutely and then uh I we I paid people in $2 bills that's a life hack pay people in $2 bills people love $2 bills um and so the whole idea is like how do you how do you uh how do you scale what was working in these three cities how do we do that uh how do we do that around the US and then we came up with this model that we call the itch model where we have um well just some numbers so in the last 30 days we've had about 10,000 people apply to an itch we say no to 97 to 98% of them uh either based on like where they are skill do they fit our model are they going to treat our customers better than any um any person than the other 98% and so we take the top 2% of people that apply to be an itch and we try to equip them with all the tools they need to be successful so this is supply chain marketing material training backend support Regional management but most importantly a brand and customers and so we built a um we built a A dispatch platform where anywhere you are around the US you can put in the problem you're having and it goes to your local itch they can claim it then they'll meet you at wherever's convenient for you so they're all mobile and um and Starbucks is actually a huge place that itcs love to service customers because a lot of people don't understand that you can uh you can I can drop my phone right now break it and in the next 20 minutes have someone here and uh replace it good as new and so uh We've we have we just passed 2,300 itcs in the company and um and they are just the most incredible service professionals you've ever met um your our average itch is between 30 to 40 years old uh he or she has a family they're not what we thought college students would be the way to expand it it's not college students and uh we're planning on adding about 5,000 more people to the company this year which is insane because 5 years ago we were living in a basement trying to fix phones so it started by Word of Mouth um came a cool College job don't know why that picture is there um so becoming bigger like how do you scale something bigger than just something that's out of a dorm room and that's that's been the um that's been the question we're trying to answer because it one of my biggest fears is we won't build a big enough company that makes an impact on how massive this Market is so in 2009 about 5% of the world's population had Smartphones at the end of this year it should be about 42% um Apple sold 74 million iPhones last quarter it's about 34,000 iPhones every hour 24 hours a day we we know that this Market is absolutely huge well what else can you do besides repair and that is you can you can buy back old devices you can deliver new devices and then the Golden Goose is actually a membership plan where for $7 a month anytime you break your device whether it's an Android iPad whatever uh you press a button and we fix it for $25 uh on the spot which is insane so uh become a master of your own domain a lot of people ask us hey why didn't you um why don't you fix this uh we have someone who joined our company that the first call they got was someone trying to fix their TomTom GPS unit and he's like why don't we fix tomtom's and it's like that well we actually think we can be the best in the world at IOS and Android repair and then we can move into other verticals and it's been an insane uh uphill battle so the one of the things I'll give you a fish analogy because you guys know I worked at a fish store um so when expanding cast a really big net and throw back what you don't want we believe this for all the tests we do internally it's hey let's see what works and then let's get rid of stuff that doesn't work and let's keep what does but let's keep everything on the table as a possibility until it's not a possibility and that's been um that's been crazy I put slow growth on here because um growing fast is actually not always the best thing so we we were we we try to grow at about 10 to 15% month over month um which by certain standards is either really fast or really slow but it it took us three years to get to a point where we're actually comfortable growing at 15% a month so don't great businesses take time don't expect to come out with an app or a website or a platform and have like crazy adoption unless you're mircat or Periscope which was sweet in South by Southwest you guys all need to go next year uh one of the one of the things that we also live by is shoot bullets not Cannonball or shoot bullets then cannonballs um in that you want to uh you don't want to spend too much resources on something that doesn't work so if you're going to change your entire Website Layout and then you launch your website and it doesn't work well you just spent six months pushing something that uh that actually has less kpis well you could have just hacked something together move fast uh I'm not a engineer my co-founder is not an engineer hug your engineers if you have one or you have a technical co-founder they're they make the world a better place and are absolutely amazing could we get a round of applause for I think all Engineers just in general cuz cuz we are We Are all uh if we're at this conference chances are we are not in engineer so so I put AB testing uh is your best friend for life so test everything uh analytics you get better at your job by analytics and and knowing what does and doesn't work uh there's a lot of really cool AB testing platforms where like minute changes so we CH there's a button on our site that is the button that is the difference between requesting an itch and not requesting an itch and we changed it from request a tech to quote and it increased conversions by 3 and a half per. that's insane and so test everything um and if it doesn't work then it's it took a couple hours to make it work how do we scale this is just AB testing so we run about 25 web tests a month which what I think is really interesting is right now the so we get a couple million people to our website a quarter but right now uh half of them don't know that they're getting a completely different homepage than the other half and that's that's insane because they're going to have a good experience but they don't know that we're actually running a control on a new uh web page right now so and then always think bigger one of my favorite things is when I'm when I'm talking to people uh whether it's investors or specifically other entrepreneurs and other CEOs one of my favorite things is when they actually have a bigger vision for a branch of our company than I do myself and it and it gives me the chills to think about when someone says last week someone goes oh you're you're building the last the world's last technical uh Workforce and I've never thought of it like that and we're going to add probably 20,000 people as ITC to our company in the next next 18 months and it we literally could be building the world's last technical Workforce um and that I I love the thought of people thinking bigger than yourself I think Founders generally they get so in the they get so in the weeds and they they're looking at such a micro level they they can forget the macro level I I think Walker at Teespring earlier he's a he's Absolut great guy but it it seems um it's crazy to if you think about well what happens if you can actually put a t-shirt on uh 5% 10% 20% of the world's population it's it's it's massive and and it seems silly if you don't go back and um and just think big always about what you're doing and then make decisions that you would make when you're larger um one of the so one of the things that I do personally is is um is I think 5 years from now if I'm looking back at this decision would I have made the same decision and that's I every day I try to get better at my job I hope everyone on our team tries to do that as well I I want to go to sleep and when I wake up I want to be a better founder than I was when I went to bed the night before and I always try to look back and uh look back at my decisions and like what I have made that decision now whether it's hiring your best friend which uh the jury's still out on it I've unfortunately had to let some of my best friends go that that didn't work out but it's still I needed to go through that uh growth curve to learn that maybe it's not the best idea to hire your best friend but when it does work it is your the best idea so um decisions are make decisions that you would make when you're a billion dollar company that you would when you're a three person startup in a basement in Sunnyville so this is a cool uh this is a cool map so every blue pin is someone that requested an ITC in the last 60 days in places we don't have itcs yet uh the purple pins are current locations of itcs they kind of get covered up and then uh the left is quarter over quarter ITC growth so we're going to add 5,000 itcs this year this is uh a cool thing so one of the things that we live by is how do we make our customers and our users Champions um our itcs will do probably about $30 million in just repair tradein and um and uh protection plans of the $225 they show up they fix your device um that insane I love that we're building a network that we can take care of uh our customers and then everyone wins this is uh this is actually a fun one so uh one of the things people uh always ask us is like hey have you guys thought of doing this and I'm like I don't want to spend time and resources validating a completely new vertical I'd actually rather have a uh big slow Corporation spend $50 million on something that does or doesn't work and then I want to study them so closely so I want to talk to uh current employees I want to talk to former employees I want to talk to uh the media and press that like released stories on it I really think that you one of like a hack is that you let other people spend their money and then you see what works if it validates then freaking charge ah head on it and if it doesn't work then you're like maybe I should do something different uh hire for strength not lack of weakness that's a shout out to Mr Ben Horwitz in one of his blog posts and that took a long time to um that look took a long time to Lear Le because when you're interviewing people for your team and for your company and your culture you're like oh my gosh they are so amazing at this yeah well they suck at this and it's like well what is their role and if if they're amazing at what they're actually doing well you can actually make tradeoffs for that person and so don't think that you want like an allaround uh excellent person I'd hire for people on specific domains and verticals and then make them champions in that uh out inovate the things that kill you so a lot of a lot of times it's like what are you going to do when uh sapphire glass comes out and we're like we we will probably fix sapphire glass cuz it breaks but um yes it does um you guys see that call out right there um so uh just out inovate things that is going to that is going to put you out of business what keeps me up at night is like what can what can kill us as a company tomorrow and then how can we actually beat it and whether it's having a um a contingency plan to Pivot or a actually we're going to blow out this vertical if this vertical gets shut off and then you also don't necessarily need to know what you want to be when you start out you'll kind of involve evolve into that this is the future that's a really good picture of our team uh we have these smart cars raise your hand if you've ever seen a smart car in SF a little eye crack car oh man we need more of them so we have a couple hundred around the us right now um they're cruising around so the the future is not actually about uh fixing a broken Android tablet the future is about what can you do when you're in your customer's home and um and we think that there's going to be a day where we well we actually think that as as new technology comes on the market your life actually gets more inherently complex so your um Your Nest Thermostat it takes up mental bandwidth when what you had was a Mercury tube that just completed a circuit when um temperatures changed it it makes your life easier but it actually adds like mental complexity your Apple watch that came out today um is actually more makes your life more complex than your previous watch or if you didn't have one um your feature phone was actually easier to use than your iPhone and so our thing is is how do you how does our Network actually take away and remove all that complexity and if if you can put someone in every city worldwide that uh that needs to press a button and solve their I'm going to turn off the uh this little timer we'll just talk for another 30 minutes um um so we we want to build the network that solves all of our customers problems at the click of a button so that you come home and and you're like oh my gosh my router doesn't work or my Nest thermostat's off or my drop cam I don't know how to set it up you literally click your itch button or your ey cracked button and we show up and solve your problems for you on the spot that's going to be very exciting uh email me directly ajc.com I get enough spam so now my email is out there for everyone uh and then also if you're one of one of our favorite types of people to hire like my favorite type of person join add to our team are former Founders and former CEOs and people who have started stuff and and have ambition I look at um if someone says hey I'd love to come work for you guys for uh for a year and then I want to start my own thing it's like oh my gosh come in like learn as much as you can add value and and um and hopefully you'll leave a better person every every job that you have you should leave that job a better person or like more skilled than before always trying to make up W movements and then I have uh email me if you're with here with your boss um I'll we we'll go into Q&A I'm I'm pretty honest with questions so if you guys want to ask um tough questions or weird questions I can probably answer them my man SC for sure do you end contractors Forex and what how how do you to maintain yeah absolutely so the the question is how do you maintain quality as you grow add uh add individuals to your company um that's a great question I think as we've gotten as as we're actually growing we're getting more applicants so the percentage that we're accepting is decreasing but what it what it comes down to is when you're looking at on demand economy um companies you're looking at our goal is we want our itcs to make $30 to $50 an hour and and we look at there's actually three tiers of ond demand economy so there's your your Uber your instacart your for um your ship your Postmates they're at a they're at like kind of your entry level 1099 economy and then you have your what we call the semi-pro economy which we think we fall into where not anyone you can't click a button on handy and have someone come fix your uh device or install Your Nest thermostat and so we're we're trying to build this Semi-Pro economy that um that you'd be surprised uh at how uh I mean 56% of our itcs have college degrees the last census 20 I think 28% of the US population did so we we have this like incredible um we incredible technical Workforce that is not your regular contractors and then we layered it once more where we're actually they're not our contractors we we sell them parts and then they chart take money from their customers and so um so we we don't deal with I guess contractor issues because we're essentially a lead supplier and a part supplier what's up oh I'm sorry I'm getting over time um so if you want to find AJ um after sorry I'm sorry told you I could answer the hardball questions but thank you for your talk yeah we're just gonna we have to move on to the next speaker but thanks I'm out all right thank you guys

James Beshara is the founder of Tilt, a platform that offers people a free way to fundraise or pool money with their groups. If you played Fantasy Football on ESPN, then you’ve used Tilt to collect money from your friends. Founded in 2012, over 300,000 groups have used Tilt to turn their ideas, large and small, into reality.

Tilt is a Y-Combinator grad and has $37m in funding.

James was interviewed by Colleen Taylor from TechCrunch.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

all right great crowd first i just want to ask if everyone um if we can have a show of hands who who's familiar with tilt formerly known as crowd tilt okay right a good number but james if you could just give us your elevator pitch anyone who doesn't know what's what's tilt and what are some of the latest numbers you can give us tilt is the easiest way man this is a sensitive mic tilt is the easiest way to collect money from a group for free so it is a lot of ways to a startup crowd one of the ways to describe it is is really goes back to our why commoner application which is what will crowdfunding look like in a mobile world and what type of crowdfunding will translate into a mobile context i can go into more detail but to consumers and to college kids uh it's really just the easiest way to collect money from a group yeah for like a party yep instead of like a 50 000 uh documentary a hardware project on something like kickstarter it's a 1 500 late night party on a college campus 2 000 bucks for a friend's 30th birthday um your fantasy football league or it is uh 900 bucks for a party bus up to napa all of those kinds of friends friendly group objectives we've just borrowed our favorite elements from crowdfunding platforms and provided for groups of friends instead great and uh you guys have gotten really large obviously but i want to kind of go back to the early days and talk about where this all began because it wasn't just crowd tilt in the earlier days you even had an earlier iteration of that what sort of inspired you to say i'm gonna you know graduate from college and just start my own thing and become an entrepreneur how did how did that happen well i've been starting things for the last 10 years or so in college started a fly fishing company for any fly fishing fans out there i started a non-profit a fellowship grant program for for research in in the field of study that i that i focus on development economics and my senior year i started to come up with this concept for grouping loans to micro insurance organizations so if you're familiar with kiva.org it was essentially kiva for micro insurance organizations total mouthful won't get into it that was actually one of the biggest lessons i learned was just a niche niche application of the software was really hard to educate people on but um but yeah i think i was always had this energy beneath my feet to start things and really saw really a big opportunity to apply this technology and and the power of the connected web to the developing world started building that out and actually what i realized was this was 2009 2010 before crowdfunding really had a name or was codified and realized wow this little feature of of this application groups pulling their money towards an objective i was basically like holy that's going to this is going to be so much bigger than just an application of micro you know towards micro insurance organizations and felt like crowdfunding itself um was going to be the next layer of the web how did you decide that that one part of your first company was the most important part of it because i'd imagine that there were other parts of the company that you were passionate about how did you focus and say okay i'm gonna focus on this one and let these other parts go i think it was it was um it was the only part we got right uh we i made so many mistakes i still make so many mistakes every single day i tell but um that kind of we you know did so much we did so much wrong of you know we built this thing for 19 months didn't tell anyone about it because we thought it was this secret we needed to just keep close to the vest and and did all these things wrong i was at that point in time with um you know people getting people on board i was so young 22 23 years old that i really wanted anyone that was that was willing to listen to me i would make them a co-founder bring them on board and it was and it was kind of um you know when you're when you're that young you really look for validation at every at every turn with tilt it was very different it was all right i need to make sure that we're doing this with with the right people so i did all these things wrong the thing that stuck with me in the back of my head that kind of just i couldn't shake was man this identity driven web um this connected web if you add finances to it if you add money to it it can have such a massive impact on an offline world that online communities and and communication um you know forums or facebook or uh twitter just it's amazing for communication but impacting the offline world requires a lot of resources oftentimes finances so it's kind of that was the little key insight that we got right um and started it and i started to think about man how could this be applied in a more horizontal or much more broad sense than just micro insurance or development okay and when you decided to focus on crowd tilt at that time it was called crowdtilt um how did you find your co-founder your cto yeah the the best advice i ever got as and i i still think about this pretty often the best advice i ever got um as an entrepreneur was and and i still i contend it's the best advice i might ever get um everyone write this down i guess yeah i was in a coffee shop in south africa in cape town south africa where i was building the first crowdfunding application um called develop if you want to look it up it's uh i was in a coffee shop with an entrepreneur down there in south africa and the entrepreneur told me the two most important things to build anything of significance is trust in a network and it's those two things um trust in a network and i've look i've googled this i've looked it up i i don't see anyone that really talks about it in simplifying terms like this but he said you know the idea isn't the most important thing you'll refine the idea you'll be wrong and so many points as many points as you're right the capital isn't the most important thing that can come with with a network the the people recruiting is going to be so much harder than you you really think when you're just getting going and it's just you and your dorm room or something and um and so all of those things that you're going to need to build something of of massive significance um it's going to depend on these two elements trust in a network and the key to it that he said was uh one is worthless without the other if you have a big network but uh you know you went to hbs but no one trusts you and it's more or less pointless um if you have a lot of trust but it's only your mom then it also isn't isn't kind it isn't uh as valuable so as both of those things and both of those things have resulted in so many um so much good fortune for for us as a company um specifically my co-founder was just through a network of investors down in austin a couple ctos down in austin there's one specific cto that really loved what i was building with tilt and called crowlthen really loved kind of this crowdfunding for the everyman type of approach to this space wanted to invest and wanted it to be successful enough to where he said hey there's a guy that one you should have a co-founder and two there's a guy down here at rackspace he runs strategies 26 very young but really really rare combination of technical and strategic thinking if i was going to start my next company he's who i would start it with so see if you can if you can rope him into what you're building his name's caleb uh come down and grab a coffee with him and i was like i heard that i was like good god i've got to get this guy on board and it was really through that introduction and and typically doesn't happen that way with co-founders but that's how it happened with us how do you think about your network when you say you've got to have a network you know that can't just be everyone that you've ever met and especially everyone here is busy you know you're a very busy person how do you maintain a network while you're also building a company i think it's hard to it's really hard to articulate it or verbalize kind of a process around it because it oftentimes if you apply a process to it you'll actually shoot yourself on the foot it actually should be much more organic mutually beneficial but i think one of the things that that i'd highlight is you build this network and everyone if you're if you're here then you're good at building networks uh most likely and that's one of the things you have to hustle at most um but you i would i would phrase it as you go into it knowing you will only need to actually call upon two to three percent of your network um in some utility fashion it really you build this massive network and most of the time you actually won't need anything from them um and it's always a surprise where you do need something and who you end up needing it from so you really can't go into it thinking a quid pro quo um taking that type of mentality you actually much like a startup much like a technology start you have to go into it thinking i'm going to provide as much value as as i can i'm going to create as much value as i possibly can i'm going to help this person that person this person that person with whatever i can and create as much value as possible and not think about how can i capture value um how is this person valuable to me it has just happened so many times um and granted a young founder with with uh limited exposure but it still has happened so many times in our career and in my career that had i gone into it thinking you know a premeditated approach of how can this person help me i would have missed out on the introduction to my my co-founder for example that was happenstance coffee with i was at a a a conference much like this actually and gary vee was speaking and i was trying to get uh in front of gary vee as you know 24 or something thinking i've got to get this this guy i was in dallas building uh tilt out of my bedroom and essentially i felt like man no investors come through dallas i've got to get in front of this guy i thought garyvee was like the most important person to get in front of in an auditorium very much like this right after the conference ended and one of the other speakers a guy named bill babel was kind of just off by himself and there was a line of 50 people trying to get in touch with gary and get in front of garyvee and and no one was talking to this guy bill babel arguably that was the most important contact i ever made um and it was kind of not trying to quid pro optimize for gaining something it was like hey this guy might have something really interesting to say he had a good good speech chatted with him and now he's he's probably our most uh impactful angel that we have that's great um and tilt went through y combinator right how was that experience what kind of takeaways do you have from the incubator experience is that something you'd recommend to to other founders yes i would um there's there's some irony in it in that going into it we didn't know what the value would be so we were you know out in texas and didn't um and really had so much confidence and overconfident that we were like no we don't need any incubator program and thought uh larry and sergey didn't need an incubator program so neither do we um but one of the things that i think it's it is so so valuable to tie it into a thread from a previous question is that network that you can build through an incubator program is just so quick it's um you can fast forward you know y combinated for us that was probably uh that accelerated 10 years of being out in the valley of a network that we would have had to build much more organically you know i think it's it is i think it's stated enough so it's it's not that it it's understated the power of that network um that you get from an incubator program but i know we still had doubts about it and really felt like you know what we're going to build was going to be on our shoulders and we're going to have to be the ones to do it and the truth is every single day it's you know i'm i i probably lean on that network uh in some form or fashion so um that's part of i i'd say part of the biggest reason that people young founders should think about it founders in general should think about it and tilt has been in this category in the crowdfunding category which has been really buzzed about in recent years so you guys were sort of fortunate to ride that wave in certain ways but i wonder if that's a double-edged sword in any way when you're building a company that's part of almost a fad or something that's like a buzz term whoa whoa whoa colleen don't call it a fad not a fad i'm gonna quote you on that in five years colleen taylor said crowdfunding was a fad no but anyone could be right anyone could be building something now with the sort of technology of the month you know um and no it's it's it's a very valid valid question i think it it is a double-edged sword at times i think for the most part um you know we we kind of we look at our approach to it and and if you you know you download the app we just launched on android uh last week and if you if you download the app it doesn't feel like crowdfunding i think it is um kind of along those lines of borrowing our favorite elements from crowdfunding and applying it kind of in our own way to smaller groups and and kind of a more everyday type of objective the um the the press does kind of toss it into crowdfunding but for the most part you know silicon valley isn't really our user base it's not really the the early adopter set isn't really our user base so i don't think it really affects us too much mainly because if you are a fraternity social chair and you use tilt and it works really really well then you don't really care what segment it's in or it's kind of like you know i didn't come across or find value in facebook because it was a social network i just used it within a few weeks i thought you know i'm finding value in this product so it's um for our users i don't think it really comes into into play the um but i think with recruits and things like that it's something that it does you know you've got to meet us to to hear our different take on it or investors you've got to meet us to hear our different take on it i mean but uh it is i think it's one of these spaces where it's it's like blogging was 10 15 years ago where there's so much hand waving about it um there's so much attention given to it i remember you know 10 15 years ago everyone was saying what's going to happen when everyone has ink by the barrel and there's no journalistic integrity anyone can just throw up an article and people are taking it as fast and to be honest um you know blogging and online publishing has been one of the most radically transformative things that that our world um is has been improved by um but it actually took six seven years for actually the second generation of of these tools to come along and really bring it to the to the mainstream the crowdfunding today only has a couple hundred thousand people across all the major platforms um us uh kickstarter indiegogo um gofundme there's only a couple hundred thousand people that have crowdfunded before if you actually add it up and you know 10 15 years ago there's one to two million long-form bloggers in the world um you fast forward now with something like twitter there's 270 million long online publishers and it almost looks unrecognizable from the first generation of publishing tools or wordpress i think techcrunch is powered by wordpress perfect example the second generation tools almost look unrecognizable from livejournal or blogger i think crowdfunding over the next five years is going to um it's going to show itself as as one of the decade defining phenomenons um but i don't think it's actually hit the mainstream like uh like we hope it will and when you think about press and messaging and these kinds of things um do you have any lessons learned on that front since most of your users aren't necessarily in silicon valley what have been some of the most valuable ways for you to get the word out about tilt yeah you just you keep it really simple um that's the the best the best advice i can give and we kind of learned this we learned this just by touching the hot stove and getting burned burned excuse me i think it's keep it simple um for you know consumers and the messaging to consumers all we stick to is is the easiest way to collect money from a group we don't get into the philosophy behind what we're building while we're building it and it's so easy to feel like you should um you know it's it is um around here people say is it it's kind of like venmo for groups be like sure that's a very good way of describing it and you have to be comfortable with that super super simple straightforward application or description for press for consumers and not get caught up in kind of this really grandiose thinking of why you're building what you're building we would see that especially going through y combinator you see that with a lot of yc founders they really want to jump into why this is going to be the biggest thing ever and sometimes you actually you should be okay with hey this is just some simple little thing to make a tiny part of your life a little bit easier so i think that's helped us with with press so you just kind of have to trust that the people will know what to do with it and you don't have to preach to them right you just you trust that the most important thing is get their kind of foot get the foot in the door get them to download it or understand how they can use it today and as a company you can actually harness it and feel very you know empowered by how big something can become but you know one of the things that that i would say in a group like this is i i think crowdfunding will go from a couple hundred thousand people to a couple hundred million um using and making use of crowdfunding in the next five ten years but to the kid on to the sigma chi at ucla's campus he doesn't really care he just wants to get people to pitch in for the keg or something exactly right um and is there one or a couple of different press mentions that you guys have had that you've really seen an uptick from that you would recommend and say hey if you can get on the today show get on the today show or something that you thought would be a bigger boost but actually wasn't yeah i'd say the in today's world it is um and and you know this as well it's just there are there's more publishing happening every single day than um than i think the previous 2000 years of human history as a 10 years ago um so it's just so much is online i think the biggest thing you should do as a founder as as early stage employee is just focus on your product and your customers not worry about press at all actually the best companies are often so misunderstood in their first few years and and even just trying to articulate in a few words what an app does what an app a really powerful app does it is it really kind of it misses the point um because if i mean just look at your home screen and try to describe to someone why an app is so cool um you know it is really really hard and now you know with the with the apps becoming mainstream something like facebook you don't have to describe it but rewind 10 years and try to describe facebook to to someone or or just imagine you describing it to your mom it is really really difficult um to describe it and press often misunderstand it so i think those products and those companies did a really good job of just focus focusing on their customers and not worrying about press too much at all right and we have a few minutes left and so if anyone has questions definitely start okay i have i think there are microphones great and so while we're getting the microphone um my last question is you now have 70 some people and you've started with building these ideas by yourself in a basement for 19 months so what's the biggest shift that you've had to make as a person when you go from being the ceo or co-founder of a couple people to to 70 plus i think the um one of the things i've learned is it is all about endurance and persistence this is a game of endurance um there's a great book called born to run if if you guys are familiar with it about a tribe in um in mexico that would run hundreds of miles um and the author notes just how like the the modern world views running as it's like childbirth it's this uh this very very painful thing that once it's all done and over with the sacrifice and the pain is worth it the truth is you know one of the things that the author cites is is just how wrong we view running and you know historically and that this tribe in mexico run hundreds of miles and enjoy every single step have fun 25 miles into a run and it is kind of that was i think one of the things that i have gotten so wrong and thought so wrong about startups you think about the idea or writing an equation on class and on a window and it's like that's what it's about and it is so much about endurance and loving every single step of the journey and i think that is the biggest surprise the cliche the journey is the destination is so friggin true it is so true so you gotta love every step that's great okay okay i guess uh first question what issues have you had with regulatory compliance and navigating all that with crowdfunding and especially with cryptocurrency cryptocurrency like bitcoin yes so we do have an open source tool it's the most popular open source crowdfunding tool uh in the world that we kind of just released last year and that has bitcoin you can actually plug in bitcoin to it but for the most part we haven't implemented bitcoin into our core app because it just hasn't been a huge uh request from from our users internally we are extremely excited about it so it's a customer base issue basically for getting that rolled out right it is like it we will get tweets pretty often of uh when you guys can i'd say in terms of our company dna we're pretty developer centric engineering-centric uh crowdfunding company maybe maybe the most developer-centric crowdfunding company out there so we hear it we want it badly but um just pragmatically it hasn't been requested enough by our users um on the regulatory side of things you know we really make use and leverage things like stripe um braintree uh skrill adian international a payment processor as we as we go international and leveraging them we don't have to deal with nearly the compliance or or regulatory issues that we would if if we're doing it all in a house so for to a large degree we just get to focus on building the social software on top of those layers so outsource is the answer sometimes yes big time big tongue uh division of labor and kind of uh separation of of concern i'm a big big believer in leaning on others uh to solve those hard problems when you can't yeah all right so you said uh the most important things are trust and a network and you said that incubator accelerates a network so it got me thinking what if anything could accelerate trust because that's the other side of the equation that is a damn good question corey accelerating trust i don't know if you can accelerate trust i think one of the ways that you can kind of get to that to the that result um is in silicon valley one of the things that you can just is a pleasant byproduct of this part of the world is the hyper connectivity of your network and so if a certain subset trusts you that trust can scale really quickly um a pretty unprecedented levels actually i know from a user-based perspective from a fraud prevention perspective we can know more about someone in just five minutes of cursor research online on that person that's collecting twenty thousand dollars ten thousand dollars you know high dollar amounts um we can know more about them today in 2015 than you could have known ten years ago with meeting them four times and getting their um their credit score i mean you can know so much about people today um that it probably that probably spills into your personal network if you have trust amongst you know 16 close close friends or 16 really close mentors in in the bay area that can scale really quickly and those intros and the connectivity can scale but in terms of accelerating that trust with those 16 people i think it's just one of those things you've got to approach every single day knowing that it's a constant investment one of the biggest mistakes you can make is thinking that all right this startup didn't work this idea didn't work now i've i'm embarrassed that it didn't work and now i've actually burned these bridges we had a nobel um a nobel laureate as an advisor in my first startup and i thought that i was like this thing is i'm about to email all of our users that were shutting this down and and all of my favorite professors all my favorite mentors and and this the founder of microfinance this is kind of this is going to be a huge bummer and probably kill this relationship and it was it was the furthest thing from what actually happened so that trust definitely definitely traverses whatever you're working on to whether it goes well or whether it goes uh south just know that it's a constant investment yeah maybe we could say it's not something you could celebrate but if you protect an integris reputation then you're good a thousand percent and protect it with your life because as the warren buffett quote goes uh it takes 20 years to build trust and five seconds to lose it there it is awesome thanks thank you good question last question hi thanks for doing a talk with us um i was actually really interested in the fact that you mentioned it sounds like you have really good product market fit on college campuses if you talk about how you've iterated on your process of basically user acquisition strategy maybe talk about some strategies that you've tried and didn't work and maybe you failed fast and what has worked for you so paul graham has a great essay that um essentially comes down to this thesis of c randomness um sometimes the world is just random and more often than not the world is just random so the answer i'm about to give you um it i don't know if it's going to be as satisfying as fireside chat questions usually strive to be but i honestly think it's the truth we felt ass backwards into virality i knew nothing about virality i knew nothing about um you know product design around virality and 11 months in 12 months in sean parker um just comes busting through the door and he's our largest individual investor and just talked about how we nailed this this uh viral coefficient when you start a tilt you invite on average 24 people 18 will join and from that a subset will start their own tilts so by definition you use the product you start a campaign and you have to invite others to use it and because it's kind of this you know it's not a 50 000 documentary it has this very everyday type of every man's type of use case that chances are of those 18 people a subset are going to split off and start their own campaigns and then a subset are going to split off split off and split off so our user acquisition was and always has been um just that that natural virality when you use evernote you could really love it but it takes you know a lunch for you to tell a friend hey i love this product with tilt you start using it by definition you have to invite others to use it with you that virality was always really high but when we looked at where the virality was highest it was college campuses and and so we went from a product that just has we've been fortunate enough to grow since day one to uh focusing on the user demographic where it grows it was growing fastest the activation energy was lowest that is why we focused on on colleges but it actually took us a long time to to find that that was uh that was the case but uh sadly we always had this uh i say sadly because it's really hard to give this advice have virality in your application uh but that was just the the truth of the matter uh we just had virality and uh we kind of fell as backwards into it and then just really try to work hard to iterate on it great thank you sure all right thank you james that's you that's all the time we have thank you thank you guys thank you thank you colleen

[Music] [Music] hustle con's pretty cool yeah yeah my name is Adam Draper I'm founding founder and managing director of boost VC um and I'm going to talk to you about fundraising uh how many people sorry these lights I can't really see everyone but how many people are have started a business and how many people have actually gone through the fundraising process okay so less of you so this is going to be relevant to most of you um that's great and it'll be relevant to all the people who have actually raised their hands uh so my name is Adam Draper I'm a fourth generation venture capitalist uh I'm a founder of uh I founded a company called expert Financial in 2009 uh I founded boost VC in 2012 from basically I help entrepreneurs not make the mistakes I made with expert Financial um and then I've invested in about 130 companies at this point collectively they've raised about $300 million and I see about 1,200 pitches uh every year so I've I've also it's not up here and probably because it wasn't relevant but I was on Nickelodeon at one point nailed it um uh but uh so I'm basically all this means is uh my my ancestors raised money and help people raise money uh I've raised money for different things uh and I really enjoy helping entrepreneurs get better at what they do um so uh today's talk I'm I I have 10 minutes to tell you all I know about fundraising which uh it it could be a longer conversation but I'm going to give you about seven points uh that I believe might help in the fundraising process it's more like Concepts to wrap your head around when you're going through the process my first my first uh piece of advice is fundraising is very difficult uh it took uh Christopher Columbus seven years to raise money from Queen Isabella uh in order to travel across the ocean in order to find India and he failed epically at that um and he found I I always picture like Christopher Columbus like going back and saying like oh man I didn't find India um but fundrais really difficult when fundraising is incredibly difficult uh when I was pitching to raise money for uh boost I emailed 3,000 people uh I met with 350 of those investors 3,000 investors met with 350 and I ended up with over about uh 35 investors um and so it was about a 10% decline but uh and it took 12 months to do this so it was uh 12 months November 2013 to uh November 2014 I was fundraising um and that's really really hard it's mentally trying so yes 35 people said yes to me uh that means that 315 people said no uh and dealing with that is a really really difficult thing every day uh and so I so really just start if you're going through that process just know going into it that's going to be really difficult uh and make sure that you're ready for the trying trials and tribulations you're going to be going through um okay number two once you've wrapped head around the fact that it's going to be difficult uh use these meetings to meet cool people um I got to meet uh everyone on Sand Hill Road uh up to Fortune 500 CEOs um and I used every meeting just as a connection the most important thing that you can get out of uh a fundraising meeting is a connection to someone because uh that's not going to be the first time you run into that person um I have a later one later piece of advice that's going to be about uh how no one invests the first time but basically you you should be thinking about this as a connection for a long period of time someone who you will be able to ask for advice uh if you have a really good connection with them so just use fundraising as a way to meet a bunch of really really great people over the course of a very long period of time it's literally like running into a wall repeatedly for 12 months uh I getting rejected 315 times in a year is not really all that fun it's literally like I spent the year just getting rejected um and then someone said yes I was like oh my God thank you um okay uh third pit your company to everyone uh this is this this means so basically VCS and Angel Investors love having prepared entrepreneurs uh and in order to be prepared for your angel investor and VC meetings have your friends pitch your friends have your friends ask you questions uh it turns out VCS and Angels aren't the only ones who ask good questions um actually we probably ask worse questions than anyone else um and and you can learn about your business and how people are perceiving your business uh and I I I really think that a lot of entrepreneurs don't do this before they get into a meeting with someone uh test it and if you're not willing to actually test your pitch on one of your friends like you're not going to be doing well in an angel or VC meeting um that's just like generally how it goes if you feel like embarrassed by your your product you're I have to pitch boost every single day um you have to be pitching your business three to 10 times every day in order to really get good at it and formulate your your entire concept um okay uh this is an unfortunate consequence of fundraising um you have no money until it's in the bank so I uh when when I went through the fundraising process you will meet a lot of uh yes-men investors uh and like you will get them to say yes in that meeting uh and that's fantastic and then uh like you you will try to follow up with them and then they might be late on replying and then uh you know you have a couple emails back and forth and then all of a sudden like it's been two months and they're not going to be wiring you any money um and like that that's very disheartening because they gave you like it they gave you that moment where you're like oh man this person said yes and then they ripped it away from you uh which is the worst feeling in the world so just know like again this is a part of like fundraising is difficult just know you have no money until it's in the bank no money is committed and so what this should do is make feel once someone says yes some of our investors actually I don't I don't necessarily recommend this but basically what they do is they have convertible notes of different amounts in their backpack and they literally will push it across the table and be like if someone says yes they're like how much and and and and it and like but it's it's literally the the concept is there where it's like you have a ticking Time Bomb of getting that money from their bank account to your bank account so just know that it's not nothing until money is in the bank uh Clicker good uh it did for this entrepreneur for the reg okay five uh this is the the one investors invest in lines not dots the first time you meet an investor that is the first time you exist you did not exist previously for that investor for anyone in in their their minds and so they're thinking okay so now I want to see this entrepreneur start a track record this is day Zero for this entrepreneur and so over the course of time time the reason accelerators like boost uh YC all these other accelerators are really good is that you you have three months investors trust us and we help companies build a track record over the course of three months and so what you wanted so lines not dots basic I'm stealing this from a really great entrepreneur his name is Jeff cird I've forgot to say that at the beginning of the slide I always want to give credit where credits do he's awesome um but uh investors invest in lines not dots basically just means you need you cannot think that an investor is going to invest the first time that you meet them uh do not ever think that you it is the first time that yeah just don't think that so uh over the course of time like just keep that investor update the best entrepreneurs they email me every month and update me on what what has gone well and what has not gone well over the last month that is all the best entrepreneurs I literally um and they're very consistent about it and it it also if you do a monthly report basically it gives you an idea of what happened over the last month for yourself you're able to summarize it for yourself but it's really important to keep investors updated um I'm sort of running out of time but okay uh investors invest in team traction or hype uh so basically team I I referred to traction is really really important get your product out there um hype is something that like I've seen entrepreneurs do this uh and it's basically you can convince an investor and all of the investor friends uh that you are the coolest thing at a moment in time and it is really really difficult to do I do not recommend trying like going out and being like I'm G to raise off of hype um I Rec I mean the best way to do like the best way to fund raise is to have a good product and good traction that is like real traction um and yeah so the that's that okay my the seventh point is have a plan B um assume I mean you really don't want to assume you're not going to raise money but realistically you might not you still need if you are truly setting out to solve a problem in the world and you really want to make that difference happen it money should not be the reason that that difference doesn't get happen um so you should have a plan B on cutting costs on making sure that everything happens the way that you want it to um and uh yeah so okay here I'm SK me through this this okay fundraising is a means to an uh so basically make sure that wasn't yeah I don't need to explain it I'll explain if anyone wants to ask me later uh but the fundraising is means you need to grow faster you need to hire someone you need to get an engineer you need to there are a lot of things that you need to do and you need that money for you should not be thinking that it's it's an element of of success um a lot there's a there's a weird mentality in the Silicon Valley right now where if someone fundraises it makes them feel that they have been successful uh it should not be that is not the mentality that you need to have you are using that money as a tool to grow your business um that's one of the most important things that you should be able to walk away from this presentation with in addition to that something to think about if you are in that fundraising process um Microsoft eBay Viva systems collectively raised $1 million when they were fundraising uh and that is uh now on the NASDAQ Stock Exchange worth 420 billion dollar uh for market caps you don't need to raise a lot of money to make a big impact I I'm an investor and the best in the the best companies don't raise all that much money um it's a really important thing don't think that fundraising is the end goal fundraising is not the end goal the end goal is building make solving the problem you set out to solve um and that's all that's my presentation hopefully you enjoyed it [Music]

[Music] [Music] how many of you guys are getting the Apple watch yeah it just went on sale today and all over San Francisco developers are sitting around thinking about how do we send them more messages on another device and get them back into our apps and that's fantastic for them but every one of these little alerts and messages is another distraction away from our personal mission our vision our goal and if we're coming to conferences like this and taking notes the way I've seen so many people do or reading books and really absorbing everything and making those connections that we need and we're still not building a business that's as big as we want it to be and we're still not making the kind of progress we want to make I'm here to to tell you that the problem is the distractions that we have in our lives all those distractions that are taking us away from our mission and my goal here today isn't just to tell you how to get through that isn't just to give you a superpower but to get you to use it right here in the room in the next nine and a half minutes that Sam gave me right here we're going to do it and use it and I know the problem because I felt the problem I live the problem a few years ago after having interviewed hundreds of the best entrepreneurs on the planet I sat down and I had to admit to myself that I was failing I was a failure I thought and I said why all I'm trying to do is since I've done all these interviews with entrepreneurs I want to start selling some interviews and or more importantly courses with them to my audience they're telling me my audience is I should start selling to them but why am I not even able to implement the plugin on WordPress to get started right you know the problem right right they're so easy but sometimes they don't work or worse than that why am I not starting to actually make some sales to people before I even get a plugin why am I holding back what's the problem and when I finally got real with myself what I realized is that I had some a problem and many problems that some of you guys might identify with I was sitting down and then email called me away and I had to go handle email you know what I'm talking about or my IM would go off or my cell phone would Buzz all these distractions taking us away from our mission but I had worse distractions than that those are external distractions tell me if you can identify with this I had internal distractions that were way worse because I would sit down and you know how Sam told you that I had a business that did over 30 million in in sales I thought well this next thing even if I install a simple plugin it's not going to do 30 million after I install the plugin maybe guys like Sam are going to see it and they're going to think Andrew's really gone down right he took a big step down so so that was in my head I also thought well people pay to go to conferences but no one pays for Content online by the way that's a lie of course they do Linda one of my first interviewees sold her company linda.com for 1.5 billion right people pay for Content she was able to generate Revenue but that's a lie that was distracting me and then I thought well you know what my friend has millions of dollars in sales he has thousands of people who are members of his site paying him every single month I can't compete with that I can't do that by the way another lie it's not something I wanted to do from day one I just wanted to prove that people wanted to buy my stuff I just wanted to prove that I was doing quality work that people cared enough about to buy it I just wanted to get started I didn't need to build a multi-million dollar company right away but all those thoughts all those lies were distractions and that's what kept me from producing that's what kept me from using these simple plugins kept me from selling kept me from doing what I wanted to do and use all the knowledge that I work so hard to get and the experience too so I finally said to myself if my head is just focused on all those freaking lies and that's what's keeping me from moving where is the truth what's the truth that I should be focused on and the truth was I did need thousands of members right away I just needed 200 members 200 people to say Andrew I like your work enough to pay you for it Andrew I'm going to be here a member of your community for the next few months all I need is 200 and the truth was that my customers my audience was telling me charge us we they wanted to support us but I wasn't listening right the problem was I had all these truths that I wanted how big I wanted to build my business and instead of focused on them being focused on them and going towards my mission I kept getting distracted by email and getting distracted by the junk in my head so I finally just sat down and I said what is true for me and it's what's true is I want to build a legacy business and only ideas will do it the way that I want it not software and people will pay for for it if I do a good job with it the truth is I wanted 200 members the truth is my audience loves my work I want to do more and so I picked one of those and I said I'm going to focus on one 200 and instead of walking into into work every day thinking how someone else was doing better I would walk in thinking 200 in fact you guys see I'm wearing some of these beads I'll explain them in a moment I just walk in I use these all over the world people have them so when I was on a trip somewhere I bought a set and I started to use them I would say 200 and I move that big fat bead right there the one with the knot and then I'd say 200 yeah I could do 200 then I move the next one go 200 if I get 200 I could get started and I could start really paying money for advertising 200 yeah right and I just say 200 200 200 and within a few weeks first of all I started actually Implement what I needed to do I installed the plugin but I got 200 members and they were all paying month after month after month and they love the work and then soon after that I got over 200 new members every single month and the things started to really take off and today there's a whole organization there at mixer G that helps me do my interviews and create my courses and there's a community of people who are there who are members to listen to it because I focus not on the junkie email but on the mission and what I wanted and what I knew was possible 200 do you ever find yourself getting distracted from your mission I want to show you how to get back into it there's something called in cognitive psychology called Target fixation I never understood it until my brother took motorcycle safety lessons when he got his bike he said look watch these videos they gave us in class everyone's going to crash I said Michael you're getting a bike why do you need to know this and he said look at that and sure enough just before the crash all of them did this two things you could almost see that their attention was going over towards the wall you could almost see them saying don't hit the wall and then they would ride and hit the wall right um it was Target fixation you whatever you fixate on whatever Target you fixate on is what you're going to hit and so when I was fixated on the target of email and when I was fixated on the target of my my friend doing better I was hidden walls but once I decided I was going to fixate on my own Target things started to actually happen towards it so that's me my goal here isn't to tell you my story and to have you guys just here and learn what works for me I want you guys to try it with me and so we I went to a factory in China I called them up and I got 500 beads just like this to pass out and the team here is going to be handing them out right now I want to make sure all of you guys get it and we're going to try the exercise right here together and I want you to have something that you can take with you when you go home because I've gone to conferences learned something good written it down said I promise I'm going to use it and I never used it and while they're passing it out I'd love to get a couple of people up here to help out Corey do you want do you guys want to help do you want to come up here the idea is this we're going to have our word just like mine was 200 we're all going to share the same word and then we're going to start with this big do you guys see that big fat bead it's called the guru bead the one that has a knot on it we're going to start by putting our thumb and index finger on that and we're going to touch it and move it and then we're going to use our index finger to touch the next one and the next one until we touch every single one of them and this holds you accountable it's so easy to say ah you know what I got it and do it one time and then get sucked right back into your rut which is oh I've got to answer email I've got to do this other thing no we're going to focus on what we want not what other people are telling us to focus on not on those distracting lies in our in our minds I call it true mind because I'm going to find something that's true useful and wanted to focus on it looks like everyone's got it right all right let's try it together for a focus exercise I'd love for us instead of using 200 that was mine I want us to use one word like a mantra together here so put your thumb and index finger on that Guru bead that fat one with a knot let's hold it up or somewhere that you can see see it and actually what we're going to do is put it on your thumb and we're all going to hold with the index finger we're going to tap down that big one and we're going to use and we're going to say the word Focus together ready one two three Focus yeah now let's move over to the next one this is reminding us to focus one two three Focus yeah next one one two three Focus let's say it louder let's make sure that Sam who's in the back there probably worried about what his next speaker is and if we're all on Target let's make sure he even hears it go to the next one one two 3 Focus yeah Sam he can hear us he's saying good now let's try it now internally I wasn't walking around on the subway on my way to work going 200 200 200 right I just mentally going in saying yeah I could do 200 I'll do it so why don't we try it all together but privately quietly try to do a full around and as you say it remember to bring back your focus focus is so important there's there's a story about how Warren Buffett and Bill Gates met at dinner for the first time and Bill Gates mom was there and she asked everyone around the table what's the most if you could sum up what got you here in one word what what word would you use to sum it up and Warren Buffett and Bill Gates both Ed the same word which was Focus they're just so focused right and we're going to get back into Focus here together so why don't we start with the guru bead and we'll do it again just mentally think the word you know what actually let's stand up and do it we shouldn't have to sit down the whole time let's stand up you could keep it anywhere by you how do you guys feel about it good Jack you're a product guy is this clear enough am I doing a good job explaining how to do it all right right you guys all see him on product hunt with with one eye out and a tongue out yeah that's the look all right so let's try it let's start with the first one just think Focus to yourself as you move move that first one then go to the next one we're going to touch each one of these make sure to keep thinking about Focus if your mind starts to wander don't worry about it because your fingers are going to move over to the next bead and your mind mind will remember hey I've got to bring it back to what I'm doing here the word focus and move the next bead hold yourself the way you would when you're really focused so you want to feel it as you're saying the word as you're thinking the word feel focused and reconnect and when you've got them all just grab a seat so focus is a good word to keep coming back to and I wanted one that we'd all have together but as you're trying this yourselves now that you've got this come up with a word or a really short phrase that has more significance to you personally that's much more connected with your personal mission that's much more about what you want to do and use that word and as you're walking around and you're tempted to just check your phone for one more time I love it or check your Apple watch which mine is coming in a few days I'm got nothing against it but spend some time just bringing yourself back to what you want to your own person personal mission everyone else is going to get you distracted this these Tron beads are going to bring you back to what's true for you I could do 200 what could you do I truly wanted to do 200 what could you what do you truly want to do keep bringing back to that all right thank you guys for all trying for trying it I'd love to hear how this all works out for you I'm going to be here to say hello and let's give them a big round of applause for jumping up here thank you cool

hey guys i'm happy to be here so i'm heidi zack the founder of third love and a little bit about my background i started my career in investment banking working with retail companies and went from there to mit for business school i was president of the retail club went from there to aeropostale in new york i was a director i launched and ran their international business and then went from there to google and i was at google a few years and i left google two years ago to start third love so we're backed by some really great vcs um raised five and a half million two years ago uh a little bit about their love before i get into press and how to get it um so at third love we're revolutionizing the lingerie industry it's a 35 billion dollar industry worldwide it's huge um third love came out of my frustration at buying a bra for any there's some women in the audience for men in the audience who don't really understand how it usually works you go to a fitting room and an old lady comes in and you're half naked and she measures you with a measuring tape and then she yells at you and says you've been wearing the wrong size that's usually how it goes um it's not cool it's not fun and that's why women don't like to get fit for a bra so basically i said there's got to be a better way and what we've done over the past few years is build an app and patented smartphone technology that lets a woman size herself for a bra from home i know it sounds crazy it actually works so the way it works is a woman puts on a tight fitting tank top and takes two photos into a mirror a front photo and a side photo and we're able to calculate the size of her body in relationship to the iphone so we tell her her size her measurements and then she can shop we also use that data at an aggregate level from all these women who use our sizing technology to create more sizes so we have 30 percent more sizes than any other brand on the market just a little background over the past year since we've launched we've spent virtually no money on paid customer acquisition we've spent under twenty thousand dollars we've really really focused on press and telling the customer our story and building word of mouth referrals this is just a few examples of the press we've gotten good morning america is probably the biggest success that they have a viewership of five and a half million every morning so that was huge for us so everyone out in the audience um if you're going to start a company whether it's b2b b2c or you are a founder we all face the exact same issue right and it's how do you get your brand noticed it's such a noisy world and how do you acquire new customers and at some point in time it may be early on or later in your company you're going to rely on press and perhaps a pr firm to help you do that so i've talked to probably every founder i meet about their pr firm and i always ask them do you like them and literally 80 to 90 will be like not so much so people generally are not happy with their pr firms you hear this over and over again it's not easy to find one to pick one or to manage one so i'd like to save you all some hassle in your lives and tell you a bit about what i've learned along the way so when we launched we were actually pre-launched so we didn't have an open website it was really a closed beta this was a year and a half ago i was looking for a pr firm that could do all of these things right that could do tech and consumer press and fashion right and i was talking to these firms and they sold me that they could this is a lie so you need to understand that every pr firm they're good at one thing it's either tech press or fashion press or whatever design it doesn't matter they're good at one thing so as the founder of the company take a step back figure out what your main goal is what are you trying to get across what's the press that matters for you are you raising money do you need to get tech press are you a company like ours with product where you need fashion press figure out who your audience is and then pick a firm that focuses on that area so now that you have your list of your top firms how do you figure out which firm to work with it's called the back channel reference right we all know what the back channel reference is we use it for hiring all the time um you know that's how you find out whether this employee who you supposedly think is going to be awesome in joining your team is going to be a great fit it's really about what somebody says who who they didn't put on their reference list so you have this list of pr firms look at their clients and then go find founders who've worked with that pr firm and reach out i mean through your network right you probably know a lot of founders or just reach out linked linkedin short little note just tell me in three words how were they were they terrible were they good or were they amazing that's all you need to know they'll get back to you so this is an example of a founder i reached out to and you can see what she writes back hi there terrible fire them okay moving on um here's another one he gives a bit more detail about three firms he's worked with um and you can see one it's what he's really raves about he says they're amazing one he kind of says is good and the other one again you see the same word used and i've heard it a lot in verbal conversations too founders will be like they're terrible so just an indication don't spend your time talking to these pr firms at the beginning back channel referenced them before don't waste your time and then last here's a pretty decent reference on a pr firm that we ended up using where the founder says good not amazing better than most so this was pretty good for me i was like all right i'll actually talk to this pr firm all right so you have your pr firm now you're going to pay them some money and you need them to do something for you right this headline here is for third love bef when we announced our fundraising we announced our fundraising and again we were pre-launched so we didn't have an open site or app yet um and you can see there's two messages here right there's a message about our technology and then there's a message about our fit and what i learned from this is a lot of things two things two main points one is when you have too many messages the press will pick up on whatever they want to pick up on so in this case they really picked up on the app and the sizing technology and that was really great but it kind of lost the message about our product quality size and kind of that consumer point of view the second point i want to make is about timing okay timing's everything when we launched we launched in the tech press and then good morning america called and when good morning america calls and asks you to go on tv with your product what do you say right you say of course this is awesome yes i want to be on good morning america you it doesn't even really cross your mind as a new founder to to take a step back and say is this the right time for me like is this the right time for good morning america um i really wish if i could do anything over again this is one of my top things i wish i had said no you know we're not live yet we'll be live in two months let me come back to you and you can have an exclusive on our launch when we actually have the website open so i didn't do that good morning america covered us it was awesome but i think the timing was off a little bit back to the messaging when we launched our new pro a new product line about eight months ago we stayed very focused you can see this message is really tight it's specifically about the product and everything in the press release was really really tight around this one message so the results of that were that we got press that talked about fit that talked about comfort that talked about how amazing our product was in all the publications that we wanted to hit um this was really the best type of pr we'd had and then lastly this is really important so whether you're reaching out to press on your own if you don't have a have a pr firm or whether you have a pr firm seed your product right the best kind of reporter is one who loves what you're doing they love that product or they love that experience so get your product out there and make them love it because then they're going to want to write about it so dana cohen here is the senior fashion editor at instyle we uh we sent her 24 7 bra before it launched and then she tweeted this right okay at third level i'm sold your bra's perfection awesome and then below that is the email that she um sent me and she says there's a frenzy in all caps over this bra in the office and you can read the whole thing and then at the end she says this will be my call out bra right this is huge so what ended up happening from seeding the product and her loving it is that we got an imprint feature for this bra and in style this was amazing for brand recognition customer acquisition everything we could have possibly wanted so i'll just leave you with one additional point and that is when you're thinking about building relationships with reporters think about it in the same way you think about building your network with vcs for example right you need to do it over time develop a network develop an authentic friendship with them so that when you're raising money you have people to talk to it's the same thing with the press you want to build an authentic relationship because as reporters move from one publication to another or as you move from one startup to another you'll still have that relationship and be able to leverage it over time hi heidi thanks my name is ramon with a smart hustle magazine and can you talk to those who are out there i work with a lot of main street small businesses who don't have a sexy product no pun intended a hot product something that's interesting but the boring you know accounting from a law firm i i have a manure business how do they get pressed because i think yours is a good job an unfair advantage everybody wants it it's interesting talk to those who are boring um i think even a boring business has interesting components so i think it's coming up with something newsworthy and stats tend to work really really well with reporters so say like a local business it may be like the amount of pizza people consume or hot days of the month for buying xyz and really try to get the reporter focused on like a tidbit because then they'll create a story around it and then a second idea is also to combine businesses together to make more of a story so it's not just pitching i'm pitching third love but maybe i'm gonna go out and pitch um really cool direct to consumer businesses so it's not just third love but it's a bunch of other ones so i think that also works thank you yeah great thank you you

How the hell did Matthew Brimer and General Assembly scale so fast? In his Hustle Con talk Matt spills the details. 

Matt Brimer co-founded General Assembly, a global education startup, in 2011 with $200,000 in seed funding. Now, just 3 years later, they have 14 campuses across four continents, $50m in funding, and 500 employees.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

so i'm going to talk about community building in the 21st century and share a little bit about some of the early uh adventures in community building that we began doing with general assembly a few years ago when we first started so a little bit about me first of all graduated from yale in 2009 moved to new york city uh while i was at yale i did a couple of entrepreneurial endeavors um freshman year i started an antique furniture business um which we discovered that yale was renovating all these old buildings and so we started buying up old pieces of antique furniture for like nothing from yale and um created an e-commerce site an online brand uh ebay store and sold them for like you know a thousand percent markup um so that was sort of my first hustle uh and then after that um started a more traditional tech startup um called go cross campus which i started junior year at yale we're basically taking um sports rivalries and college rivalries and putting them online and building these sort of massively multiplayer social communities and games online allowing people to live out their their school rivalries unfortunately we never really figured out how to generate any revenue with that one which apparently is important for running a business you know so they say um and we end up raising a couple million venture capital uh the recession hit in early 2008. um we tried to raise another round and it wasn't happening our bank account was just going in one direction um we also made a lot of first-time founder mistakes and you know we had to shut that company down and it failed and i said i graduated 2009 and so this startup failed right when i was graduating and my whole plan was all right i'm gonna go graduate from school and work full-time as co-founder of my own startup unfortunately that's only possible if said startup actually exists and has money which it didn't so moved to new york um you know i never really had a i've never had a real job so to speak um but you know as i moved to new york and i'll talk about this in a minute um about a year in after moving to new york um with a couple couple other friends started general assembly and you know now fast forward a little bit to today 2015 you know we've raised just about 50 million dollars in funding we just hit over 500 employees um our hr team told us the other day and um we have campuses in 14 cities around the world so quite a lot of growth in the last few years and they can talk about you know some of the early community strategies that we pursued to to get to where we are today i also you know about a year or so ago started a very large side project um still full-time in general assembly but uh daybreaker is another thing i started which has now expanded pretty pretty rapidly we're at nine cities globally um and counting and that's that's for a separate talk um but we're in san francisco if you guys are up for an early morning dance party um all right so let's um let's talk about sort of the problem the situation here um so rewind to 2009 right the recession had hit new york city um this is where is where i was based you know and i'm seeing that the recession that hit and tech was really transforming every single industry out there whether it was um retail or journalism or advertising or finance or fashion you know technology was transformed in these industries and companies were changing the kinds of talent that employers were hiring for was changing at the same time you know we were seeing that the new york tech scene was really starting to blow up it was starting to become this burgeoning real thing and i know you know here in the bay area you guys have been doing this for decades um in 2009 you know it had been like a few years you know it was very exciting at the time um but it was it was pretty ad-hoc and somewhat disjointed you know there's a meet-up here an event there and um it didn't feel like it was as cohesive as we thought you know maybe it could be at the same time due to the recession you had a lot of people who were seeking new career paths they were coming out of traditional industries maybe they had lost their job or corporate jobs were less secure and less available as people once thought employers were looking for new kinds of skills people were realizing you know what you know tech is becoming more and more of a thing maybe i need some tech skills maybe i need to make myself more marketable you also had a lot of young people coming out of college and with just their college degree they weren't marketable you know it wasn't it was hard for for young people to find jobs with just a college degree people looking for new inspiration new communities new opportunities so that was that was a situation um we were seeing all this and you know we sort of had this idea what if we could create a physical place not an incubator not an investment firm not a vc um and not just a co-working space either but let's create a physical place a community nucleus if you will for the startup ecosystem in new york city a place where people come could come together to learn from each other to collaborate professionally and to interact socially right so we really believe that you know there shouldn't be these walls between your educational life your professional life and your social life but in today's world and especially where we think you know things are going and and most um obviously what we were saying the startup space it was better with all those things or all those walls those separations are torn down and that your your personal um world and your professional pursuits and your intellectual educational life were maybe a little bit more seamless so we set out to create a physical home a hub where all this you know activity could happen and we could create that kind of um create some sort of nuclear fusion um that could spark you know new companies new ideas new opportunities um for people in new york city so i want to talk about then how we did it right what we what we did um a couple of tactics so i'm gonna talk about six tactics activate the core these are community building tactics that we really pursued early on um and and this is sort of the the meat of um of i think what we did that really worked activate the core give karma get karma establish clear norms and values create meaningful offline experiences balance curation with openness and be authentic and live your mission so let's dive in activate the core this image is the ace hotel you guys might have been there um in the flat iron district um before general assembly i was hanging out here a lot this is sort of my my daytime home base it was a place where people would go and work on their startups code have meetings have coffees get mentorships hang out listen to music whatever and it sort of was one of the inspirational places for ga early on so when you think about activate the core and what was you know some of the the piece of advice there or you know one really focus your early efforts on building a powerful um sort of central core of true believers so you know what we did with general assembly was um a lot of a lot of one-on-one coffees a lot of conversations you know i would bring people that i met to the ace hotel you know when i moved to new york i knew maybe 10 people i just graduated from college you know i didn't really have a network but i started to go to events i started go to meetups i started to meet people i started to get introductions and i started to tell people about this thing called general assembly that i was working on and a lot of that early relationship building was really useful and really necessary i would organize group dinners where i'd bring together different people who i'd met who were interested and excited about this idea of general assembly wanted to share when to give ideas give advice they wanted to be a part of it they wanted to you know help and i was really encouraging of those people to give that to us and and see you know how can we help you how can you help us let's think about this as a as a community gathering and so small group dinners um were useful space tours we would we before we actually took a lease on our first campus i brought in maybe 100 different individuals vcs engineers entrepreneurs designers etc brought them into the space in the raw empty space and said what would you have here what would you want to see in this campus what do you think about this classroom setup what do you think about this open desk plan what do you think about having a lounge and a big communal table here getting people's invite advice and insights getting their feedback that way they became more invested in what we're doing as opposed to us just trying to sell them you know i was really asking them what would you want here what would be useful for you um i was also you know manually building our email list so our first 1000 people on our email list were individuals that i had either met and talked to about general assembly at an event or a coffee or what have you also people who might email back and forth so i would keep a tab open in my browser every time that i emailed with someone or i met someone an event any interaction that i had with an individual about general assembly i would take their email address throw it into a tab put it into our mailchimp list and then a few months later once we started to really get the word out and start to spread spread the news about this thing i had a thousand people who were already familiar with general assembly and that was really you know how we were able to build that that core audience we also um we didn't actually raise money until about nine months into launching general assembly and how we were able to do that was we were able to get a grant uh from the city of new york to help get started we sold some corporate sponsorships i got some corporate sponsors to uh to give us some cash and then we pre-sold co-working memberships before we launched so activating this really core community of true believers we got startups before we even opened to say yes i want to be a part of this thing i want to join general assembly and i'm willing to give you some money to hold my spot and to guarantee membership in this space and that's how we funded the build out of the campus and and the signing of the lease and so immediately when we opened up we were totally full and we're already generating revenue and so you know those early adopters that you cultivate will become your evangelists if you do well by them they'll do well by you which brings me in my second um my second tactic give karma get karma so you know one of the things i really encourage in community building is try to be as useful as possible give connect inspire people support them do whatever you can to help them in their mission you know when i as i said early on when we were first getting started um you know we been launched right we thought well we don't have anything to give you we're not offering classes we're not offering space you know we're not teaching workshops yet however we started making introductions and probably every day for the first year i would make maybe five to ten introductions a day and those well-placed intros add value to the ecosystem everyone benefits and by then i mean if you if you find two people who don't know each other right but probably should um you know i came across a lot of people in our early networking community building days you know let's say someone's working on a fashion startup and then there's an investor over here you know i met a few days later interested in fashion startup opportunities if they didn't know each other i would get in touch and say hey do you guys know each other because you should probably connect and i would make that introduction and both of them would benefit from having known each other and i would look good for doing it right and i wouldn't lose anything you know it wasn't a zero-sum game you would just add value to the ecosystem so the more that you just send out karma and add value to the ecosystem making introductions offering advice being as useful as you possibly can you never know exactly how that's going to come back to you you know serendipitously and i was never really asking for anything in return i never you know said well i'm making all these introductions for you how about you know you give something back to me i just try to be as useful as i possibly could to anyone in my network and then you know a year or so later when we're launching general assembly we needed instructors or we were looking for sponsors or corporate partners or investors and we sort of put those asks out into the universe people just sent back support in throws because they knew that we were such an additive positive part of the community so there's that there's that karma piece that's very very real even if it's uh hard to you know point to tangibly number three establish clear norms and values so i think this is really really important when you're first starting and building your community really codify the founding principles of your brand think about what those are even maybe even before you launch what what are the what are the core community values and principles that you want to drive the brand everything else should flow out of that start with those values start with your those principles figure out what matters to you and what how what values you want the community to believe in as well and so how we did that is we actually encouraged a culture of reciprocity um through a physical we call it search engine and it was these two huge bulletin boards and on the bulletin board we had a piece of paper and you could say um i'm offering bl i'm a blank and i'm offering you know blank and you say i'm a developer and i'm offering free um mentoring for people interested in learning how to code or you know i need um a ux designer to help me with my mobile app and people could post this stuff physically and you know we weren't asking we're taking a cut of any deals that happen we just encouraged people to put what you're offering and what you need and then encourage people to connect in real life to share and give back to each other so that culture of reciprocity was a was one of our our core community values and we really encouraged that physically in the in the community space a couple of the other values that we we chose to really inspire and drive our community um these are the six that we chose the general assembly obviously you know when you guys are building your communities and growing your audiences choose your own um people before the machine you know that's that's sort of a key one you know it's realized generally something's about the people it's about the individuals it's not so much about um you know the technology is is much as much about transforming people's lives passion and purpose really encouraging people to think about where they want to go what matters to them not just not just making a lot of money in their careers own your own path that was another important one this idea of choosing um you know taking an entrepreneurial approach to your career essentially even if you don't necessarily want to be an entrepreneur right now and start your own company in this day and age um you know people are changing changing jobs uh every couple of years and so it's important to know what skills you're looking for it's important to know where you're going where you want to take your career path because there's not some sort of great pathway that says here's how to be successful follow these paths ultimately it comes down to you and you figuring out what does success mean to me what's going to make me happy how am i going to find meaning number four create meaningful offline experiences this is an event we did general assembly did with pencils of promise which is a really cool non-profit organization building schools all over the developing world and you know we we really tried to do a lot of um a lot of offline sort of magical engaging experiences that would create really memorable moments for people that they would take with them through their weeks and and through their days you know there's so much talk about online ux design right and user experience and a lot of that is referring to a mobile app or a web app or something right one of the things we thought a lot about is well what about offline ux design what about experience design right how can we create experiences that are magical and memorable how can we get people engaging in real life you know people connect far more deeply offline than they do online you know there's only so much interaction you can have with another human through a message board or through a group or through a message you know text or something like that or through an image but getting people together in real life and set the lighting and the music and the the entertainment and the vibe and the people and the speakers that create the content create these you know really magical experiences that people are going to take with them and remember and say wow that was powerful i met some great people i connected with others and i have now a much stronger connection to the brand or the product or the organizer putting putting this experience on a couple of examples there um you know we uh we did we did an event called heartbeats um uh a number of times actually here in san francisco new york hong kong london a few of our cities and essentials a social event where we set one design constraint we said okay there's a social event where there's one rule and the rule is you cannot talk about your job so no one could go around and say what do you do you know because that's such a common networking thing right that's the first question everyone asks is that well if you can't talk about what you do for a living and instead we encourage people to talk about what you love to do outside of what you do for a living you know music art activities um hobbies whatever it is and it got people interacting in a really interesting way and it was a lot more memorable and interesting of an experience than you know just your typical networking event um a couple of other ideas you know fireside chats um live bands you know try to try to break the norm try to create original memorable experiences um that people are gonna take away because that's the drives community in a big way number five balance curation with openness this is this is tricky you know with any community that you want to build there's really this balance right so a really tightly curated membership um where you're very selective about who you want in and choosing you know just the most incredible people will yield quality individuals and a great community and high quality interaction at the same time to the outside might come across as unwelcoming too exclusive to clubby and this was a concern that we had with general assembly we said okay well you know early on we offered whoever co-working and it was this invite-only membership-based co-working um community and we really wanted to make sure that it wasn't just pay to play that it wasn't just anyone off the street but that you could actually um but the only like really high quality startups and entrepreneurs were able to be a part of that community right and once by doing that we knew that people in that community the members would know all right there's some minimum bar of quality i can let my guard down a little bit i can feel familiar with these people i can interact with them knowing that the other people here are sort of like-minded and of my same ilk right however we knew that if we just did that you know we had to run the risk of becoming you know an exclusive club or a membership that would feel weird to the people who are outside right and so we said okay let's have a curated invite only community of co-working members but then take all of our programming all of our classes and events and workshops and open that up to the public and have that be an opportunity for anyone who was interested in learning skills getting involved in the startup scene you know making it right that they could come in and feel like that they were a part of the ga community as well so think about how you want to do that balance curation you know for quality but also make sure that you're welcoming and open um because that's important for putting your brand as well and then last um be authentic and live your mission so you know be earnest think about think about what how can you authentically live the values of of your community and of your your brand um if you're building a community you really need to care about your people right so the spirit remember i talk about those core values and core norms you need to live those yourself every day you know if you're not living those values if you're not living those principles on a day-to-day basis basis your community is going to know it and they're going to feel it it's going to feel inauthentic if you're trying to get other people to um to participate in these things you're not doing it yourself then you're being a a bad leader you know i think um as a community builder you're you're a convener you're a facilitator you're you're you're a public servant right you were there for your people you're not a celebrity it should not be about you it should be about them um i remember early on you know people said that the early you know early couple of years of general assembly community building felt like this grassroots political campaign um and i remember you know i knew that we were doing something right when about three months before we launched our campus so this is maybe november of 2010 we launched in january of 2011. in november of 2010 we didn't have a website we didn't get any press we avoided all publicity and press until actually we opened and i had again brought about 100 people through the space i had tons of coffees dinners a lot of that grassroots community building and i started here people were telling me hey brymer um i was at this meetup last night and you know and i wasn't there i wasn't at that meetup i was at this meetup last night and one of the big topics of conversation between all the attendees was general assembly and people were excited about it people didn't know what it was but they were excited it was it was awesome and they heard rumors and they were they were getting pumped and i knew that something was going right if other people were talking about general assembly and spreading that message and getting doing that community building and it wasn't just me you know hustling and preaching but that i'd gotten other people excited enough because they saw that i was authentically believing in this stuff and that they sort of took those reins themselves and so you know what what had happened is really you know became a nucleus of the startup ecosystem in new york this is me a couple years ago um giving a talk uh one of our most popular talks um introducing the new york startup community at the french embassy in new york actually um which was pretty pretty wild um but we you know within six months of launch you know people were telling us people were coming to us saying ga is like a core center nucleus of the new york startup community which was kind of our dream from the very beginning and it was just so amazing to hear other people tell us that you know we had 10 times the number of applicants then could physically fit into the co-working space and almost every single night we were running classes and workshops and talks that were sold out you know we knew that we were doing something right we knew that there was a product market fit there we knew that the community was vibrant enough that people were coming to us and and willing to spend some money to be a part of that community to learn to collaborate to meet other people and you know as we grew our community and brand became you know pretty well known and respected in the industry and um you know about about maybe six or seven months in in launching in you know sort of mid-2011 we said okay we sort of made it as like a core hub of the startup community in new york great um but we thought you know what we think we actually have a little bit of a bigger vision on our hands um and this it's not just about being the center of the startup ecosystem in new york that's that's great that's fine um but we realized you know what we have all these people coming to us seeking community seeking inspiration but also seeking to be relevant and seeking skills and opportunities in the the rapidly changing 21st century economy and so we thought you know what we may have something bigger and the bigger vision was to realize we can actually build an entirely new kind of educational institution one that focuses not on pieces of paper not on giving degrees but focuses on giving people really practical vocational skills and 21st century topics like technology design business marketing etc as well as plugging them into a really supportive community and network of fellow doers and practitioners and creators and also creating opportunities for our graduates and alumni so that as they go out into the world we can actually get them jobs we can actually help them start companies we can actually help them find work that they're passionate about and help you know them um help empower them to pursue work that they love that was that was the bigger vision that we realized and that's what we've been pursuing now um ever since the last last three or four years so this is a map of a bunch of our campuses right now we have physical physical campuses and in these cities all over the world um with more coming soon you know we do a lot more a lot of online education now as well but really the heart and soul of what we do is in person very hands-on educational experiences that are transforming people's lives for the better so what's next what's next for us um as i said you know we're really focused on transforming people's lives and empowering them to pursue their calling so we want to make sure that anyone who's willing to work hard and follow their passions can have a meaningful career pursuing work that they love and we intend to build a long-term educational institution that will be around for decades you know we're not here to you know flip something we're not here to build something that's going to be short-lived you know we're teaching you know ruby on rails and lean ux and um and you know google analytics right and just as a handful of little topics right that we offer that's what we're teaching now in 2015 right well in 2020 2025 we don't know what we're going to be teaching we know it's going to be relevant to those years and we know it's going to be practical and useful and transformative and community oriented but it means that we constantly need to be updating our curriculum and evolving to meet the needs of you know the present and the near future so that when our students come to us whether they've taken a class before they haven't we make sure that they're getting what they need to make them relevant as successful as possible in the day and age that it is and so when we think about building an educational institution to last we're never finished right we're always evolving it's always changing things are never totally stable you know we intend to grow our community to become really probably the most valuable and indispensable part of what we're doing we want to make sure that the general assembly community is as personally and as professionally valuable as possible for our alumni so the skills training and the the workshops and the courses and the educational programs getting people jobs all that's really critical right but ultimately in the long term we want to make sure that if someone's looking for a job looking to level up in their career looking for new skills looking for opportunities looking for a co-founder whatever that the first place they come to is their general assembly alumni community and that you know we want that to be one of the most valuable assets that we have at general assembly and so that's why community building is so important and i think for a lot of a lot of companies a lot of businesses i think you know that your community of customers of clients or users or whatever the more that you cultivate that and the more that you make that as strong as possible not just with your interactions to them you know not just the brand interactions with uh with the individuals but how can you get the individuals interacting with each other you know we can only do so much for our alumni but the more that we can help connect our alumni up to each other and create means and values and and a culture of reciprocity so that our alumni are helping each other that's how we can scale this community to become you know a truly global um and powerful powerful network so you know we're about this by this year i think we'll be about 25 000 alumni in our in our in our community and that's that's growing fast and you know we intend to continue to expand around the globe with online and offline so want to thank you all for um having me up here i'll take a couple of questions here's my contact info social profiles but yeah thanks for having me take a couple questions thank you matt if anyone has any questions come on down awesome well first i want to thank you for coming and speaking to us i think you brought up a lot of really good points and i definitely learned a lot from you so i guess one of my first questions is more focused on scaling the community and still maintaining that personal touch so how have you been doing that how do you plan to continue to do that totally um right so as i said we're about by the end of this we have about 25 000 alumni right there's a lot of people um we first started our campus new york city we had two or three hundred people right and it's a lot easier to create a really tight-knit cult you know cultural um energy and community with just a couple hundred people it's much harder to do with those larger amounts so i think what i would i would say and how we're thinking about it is it all comes down to nested communities right 25 000 is a large number of people um and it's hard to feel much intimacy there so what we do is you know we have as i said you saw that map right we have physical campuses in all these different cities right so within that larger 25 000 network um every city is building community right so new york has their community right and that might be a couple thousand people right and then within that you know any one city um there's individual courses right so any one course might be 25 people right in our in a general assembly and so it starts by having that nested core community of 25 people in a class getting those people interacting and tightly engaged very loyal to each other right and then you have that sort of um that's like the smallest circle right and then let's say that's a ux course right we might have events or programs that bring together all of our students in new york who've taken that particular ux course so that might be several hundred people right we'll get those people interacting and start to build community at that size right and then we'll have alumni um events or we'll have like a quarterly commencement where we'll invite all of our alumni from the last year or so back to participate in a quarterly commencement ceremony and that brings people from the whole new york uh network together so it really comes down to i think these tight sort of small nested communities and then and building out from there awesome thanks all right cool thanks everyone

Rick Marini is a successful founder and active angel investor.  He founded Tickle which led to a $100m exit and most recently founded BranchOut and Talk.co which was acquired by Hearst media.  On top of that, Rick is an investor & advisor to 40+ startups.  Pretty incredible.

In his fireside chat with Sam, Rick talks through the trials and tribulations of starting and running companies based on his own experience.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

but right now i want to introduce uh our guests for a little fireside chat uh it's gonna be about 20 minutes long and as we're talking a few minutes in if you have any questions or anything make your way down here uh and you could ping your question to or tell eric your question he'll grab our attention and we'll go from there but uh i want to introduce the founder of tickle and branch out rick mourini all right what's happening so i get to be the only thing between all these people and beers right that's right no pressure so rick's been kind enough to join us but i emailed them um about uh in june and when he said yes i was just so pumped and so happy to have him so we agreed to do this little chat so uh so let's just begin with a little bit of your background who are you why are you cool um how about who am i not why am i cool um so let's see so i'm rick mourini i uh let's see i grew up in a small town in new hampshire i've been a tech entrepreneur out in silicon valley for the last 15 years undergrad was unh back in new hampshire then started to work for a company called fisher scientific doing corp dev corporate finance not technical kind of stuff that we do out here and then went to harvard business school and got my mba there and that really changed my life because i met my co-founder of my first company there a guy named james currier and james and i um at hbs took the myers-briggs test along with everyone and that sparked the idea for our first company which was called tickle.com tickle was the largest personality testing site on the web and uh it actually became the 18th largest site in the world at one point and we started that company back in cambridge and moved it out to san francisco back in 2000 and grew that company to uh to 100 million dollar exit back in 04 stuck around there for a couple years and uh with an earn out with monster started my second company super fan which built facebook apps and social games kind of a digital agency for brands like cbs and universal and sony and others and then had the idea for branch out so pivoted the team over to doing branch out and branch out at this point has over 800 million profiles so that's grown into a big site and other than that i've also done a lot of angel investing i'm in over 40 angel investments and advisory rules now so just for the record i just realized this we did not plan this uh our outfits just wanted to get that out there i i just realized this is very similar yes great minds think of like i think same socks yeah no hopefully hopefully not close okay if only i had the uh the patrick dempsey haircut we would just uh so i don't know if that's good or bad but go ahead and move on oh it's good uh so before we uh before we we were hanging out a couple weeks ago and uh we're we're chatting and you said that when you started tickle uh you wanted to you had you had two goals you said you're not going to quit unless you either went public or sold it for 100 million dollars and when you think about it for a quiz company i mean that's like that's mind-blowing like who on earth would think that most people would never think that's even possible what made you think that was possible i mean did you have market validation was it a gut feeling i mean what made you why you were crazy why did you think that so it was more gut feeling um there was no magic around that number it just felt like a big round number that two guys from small town new hampshire could strive to get there you know a billion dollars sounds too unattainable um but 100 million sounded like hey if the stars align and we work hard maybe we get there and um you know when when you've got a successful company you know your goal is always going to be to to go public right every entrepreneur wants to start a company and go public and and one of the lessons there is um you've got to know when to sell and and when to uh to hold and keep going and i think a good example of that is mark cuban who started broadcast.com he was very smart to sell to yahoo for 5.7 billion dollars back in the day and then mark zuckerberg was very smart not to sell to yahoo for a billion and keep going and now facebook is worth almost 200 billion so um so yeah i think the lesson there is you've got to know when the right time is to sell and um and for us we had seven different offers uh for for tickle and um the seventh one is finally the one that got us to 100 million which we can we can go back to later but um but once we got to that number it felt right which which was way different than what joel was talking about earlier he was talking about lean lean method methodology and validating and market validation but for you it was just a gut feeling almost it was a gut feeling it was a goal um you know you want to set high yet attainable goals and we got there but you know there was also when you're in a position like that where you can you can see the future um and you you understand your business better than anyone else of course when you've got a high probability of success the way that i think mark zuckerberg saw his business going that's when you don't sell when you don't see a very clear path to be able to get to the next level that's when you sit back and you say maybe i should lock in some money now and especially you know coming from you know i didn't come from money so when you have the chance to do that put some money away um which you know it can be rainy day money so you can go take some bigger chances later i think that makes a lot of sense when you don't see a clear path to getting to the billion dollars all right so since tickle you've done super fan you've done branch out and now you're an investor i mean you've done a bunch of different companies when you are starting out how do you judge between going after something that you're extremely passionate about versus something that is very clear that it's an opportunity to make a lot of money how do you balance that because it seems like something that everyone struggles with so i think any entrepreneur starting a company should probably write down the five or ten things that motivate them and financial return should probably be one of the five but hopefully not number one and following your passion because you love a certain space should also be top five definitely top ten but maybe also not number one you know a lot of people like me love sports or music and would love to build sites around that the reality for most is that it's really hard to be able to attract a lot of money into that from venture capitalists as well as to be able to build it up and get a lot of traction because there's a ton of competition and hard to have a big exit right so when you start to raise money you've got to be realistic about do i have an idea that goes beyond my personal passion is this an idea that can get vcs or angels really excited and not just get me excited but get you know the entire ecosystem behind this you've got to hire people that would be potentially leaving their jobs leaving their high paying jobs that pay their bills and support their families to also come on board with you which again your passion needs to translate beyond just what you're into and be able to support bringing investors in bringing other employees in and being able to give a good return so it's not just about the financial return it's not just about the passion you want to bring all those together to be able to to do something that gets you excited every day and i don't just mean i want to do a music site because i love music getting excited i'm an entrepreneur that has started a couple different companies and they weren't my like passion like online personality tests with tickle wasn't like my passion and with branch out career networking recruiting on facebook isn't my passion what is my passion is the ability to create companies that touch the lives of hundreds of millions of people so with tickle we had 200 million registered users with branch out we have over 800 million profiles i would rather create companies that have a positive impact on hundreds of millions of lives than do a little niche site music site um that is something that i that i'm passionate about but that's me and everyone's got to figure out their you know their goals but if you want to be realistic and attract revenue attract funding and be able to have a big exit you've got to think about what what's going to get me there and your personal passion project may not and by the way i also want to go back to something earlier when i had said about you know 100 million was was a good exit i was happy but you could go for the billion a lot of people think that if they don't get to that billion dollar exit right if they're not the next whatsapp or or snapchat or whatever that it's a fail you know if you raise a small amount of money especially angel money and you sell your company for 5 million 10 million 20 million that's a big hit and that changes your life in a big way as long as you didn't raise too much money where you still own a lot of the company so you know if you guys are thinking about starting companies or getting involved early stage in a company there's absolutely no shame in selling for 10 20 30. i mean that's a big hit silicon valley is really focused on the billion dollar exits a because it gets headlines and and b because that's what the vcs need to hit but for for most entrepreneurs that billion dollar exit is never going to come but being able to to lock in you know x millions of dollars is life life-changing and that's far more important than getting you know headlines and techcrunch and by the way as we're chatting if anyone has any questions we've got a mic over here you can line up and we'll try to call you call you so you can ask your questions as we're chatting um but you mentioned that you said there was five things that mattered to you when starting companies said passion and also the financial gain are there three other ones that you actually have for you um i didn't bring my list with me but i'll i'll kind of make some up so um i think you know being being a founder of a company one really cool thing that you get to do is you get to pick who you work with so for me i like to hire people that are highly intelligent people that have integrity people who are entrepreneurial they roll up their sleeves they they work hard and people that are fun so that's who i like to work with that's who i like to be and and that's something that's important running running companies i think um and again you know i talked about being able to change the world in a big way that's something that that if i'm going to spend my time you know some people say if i could just change the life of one person it's worth it it's not for me because you know i think a lot of us here in silicon valley are really lucky we have the ability to touch millions of lives i don't want to just help one person i want to help you know 10 million 100 million people right um and so i i if i are in the crowd right now i'd be thinking well it's easy for you you've had 100 million dollar exit it's easy for you to say these things well if you didn't have that 100 million dollar exit clearly you've started companies since then how would you do it without that cushion let's say someone's out there and they're broke let's say someone's an employee they're having to work part-time just to pay for their living what would you what would you if you were in those shoes what would you do okay so i'll answer it as as an angel investor um i've done 40 angel deals i bet half of them are probably from um serial entrepreneurs people have had an exit and they want to do another one and maybe it's their second or their third company um guys like travis and garrett at uber right so i've been friends with those guys for 10 years they had done two successful companies before and then they did uber there's other guys that that um that i've i've backed that are first-time entrepreneurs i mean look at mark zuckerberg i wish i was a backer in facebook but look at him like he started a company he was 18 years old right so so it doesn't it doesn't matter that you've you've been able to do it once and then it's easy street after that the reality is if you're a passionate person if you've got a really interesting idea if you can execute on that idea if you have a good attitude an attitude goes a long way i mean life to me is kind of 10 of what happens to you and 90 of how you react to that right so if you have a good attitude and you have all those other other things lined up you're going to be able to attract great people around you as well as investors people like me and other angels and vcs so there's there's absolutely a path to being that next mark zuckerberg for people like that and as a non-technical guy um would you be following the the lean methodology that joel was talking about uh i mean that wasn't exactly the case with tickle but is that what you would do now yeah so i mean it's a lot cheaper to start companies now than it was back in 1999 when i did my first company so but one thing as a non-technical founder you have to find your tech soul mate and if you don't find them don't bother trying to raise money if you're in a tech company because the first thing that the angel or the vc is going to ask for is all right well you've i've got i've got the idea i know what you're going to do now i want to understand the technology where's your cto let me talk to him so you absolutely have to find that technical soul mate when you're starting a company and that's something that you do now as an angel i mean you're always absolutely yeah i mean i mean even as a non-techie i've been around this for 15 years so i can ask enough of the right questions and if i'm not hearing the right answers like i don't you know i don't have a cto i mean that's obviously a red flag all right do we have a a question we do have some questions here what's going on rick um i'm from boston lived in new hampshire for a while so i love me some kimball's orange pineapple ice cream uh so here's my question it's kind of two part uh one i would love to become to eventually become an angel investor um so first question is what would you say is the minimum capital you need to become an angel investor and the second question is um do i really need to go to business school to to get there and i really mean that neutrally let me like what did you gain from business school yeah that you wouldn't have i'm gonna take the second one first because it's a shorter answer no you don't need to go back to business school um it's a short answer i loved my time at hbs um it was it was life-changing literally it was a life-changing experience because i didn't go back into corporate finance where i expected to go back i met my co-founder and i became an entrepreneur it changed my life now that said i grew up in new hampshire i went to undergrad new hampshire i went to b school in boston i mean that was my life there i wasn't out in silicon valley i wasn't going to conferences like this i wasn't going to network in events and everything that everyone here has access to it could be a waste of two years of your life to go back and i'm a proponent of education but you can educate yourself here go work in a startup for two years and learn a ton if especially if you want to be a founder like what i always tell people who want to be a founder is um if if you've never been in a startup you're you're jumping in too early go work for a startup learn on someone else's dime by the way if you go to hbs it's going to cost you what i don't know 75 000 a year whatever it is instead here you're getting paid 100 grand or more or whatever it is to work and to learn so so use that time here that's the money that i saved up to potentially be an angel investor okay good so now you've got that saved up and now on the angel question um angel investing is highly highly risky right so whatever your percentage of your portfolio that you might allocate towards high risk investments i mean like super high risk maybe that's five percent of your portfolio you should not be doing more than five percent of your portfolio in angel deals because you should expect that many of those at least half of those will be a zero and it's really hard to make up when you have zeros so you know i mean start small um especially with companies that you know something about so for me as an angel you know i always look for great teams of course that's always number one i look for big markets and disruptive technologies um and that's really important but third i tend to invest in consumer internet and and mobile and social and marketplaces things that i know because of two reasons one i can understand what they're doing and number two i can be helpful so try to stick to your your your area of expertise when you're doing angel investing especially early days i have more questions but i'll be respectful maybe we can catch up offline okay cheers um so uh we kind of skipped over a a pretty fun story and a pretty important part of uh who you are which was the story of tickle we kind of skipped over the part of the 100 million dollar exit and when we were chatting earlier you mentioned i mean i was pretty amazed at it at what happened obviously like i'm sure everyone here is uh but you talked about uh when you were with monster.com bought it uh when you were with them you told me that getting there was 99 perspiration and one percent inspiration and i think that's pretty wild because really the odds are not in your favor to have a hundred million dollar company so how are you balancing the idea of getting lucky versus working your ass off and getting the the ability to even negotiate that deal yeah so the word lucky um so you guys have probably heard um the harder i work the luckier i get that is true the other is you have to put yourself in a position to be lucky and that's what we did with um with the deal with monster i mean we worked our butts off um we started the company in 1999 we sold it in 2004 so there's five years there we raised money in march of 2000 march 6 of 2000 which was the day the nasdaq tanked and the bubble burst and that was not a fun time luckily we got the money in before that happened and moved out here and the first two years were really really hard out here because it was a recession i mean it was you know silicon valley was impacted more than any place else in the country and it was just not not a fun place 2001 we were three months away from going under i mean it was really scary our bankers and lawyers were telling us you should close up shop and you know pay off your bills and we said [ __ ] that we're not going to do that i mean we've never lost in our lives and we're not going to lose on this and does going under even include your personal what you have i mean your personal worth yeah i mean everything was in in the company so going under means that you are you're screwed yeah i mean big time so not just a company but you yeah so we put like everything into it and uh yeah i think yeah yes yes yes um this [ __ ] is hard yes it's uh so we put everything into it and i started i picked up the phone and started doing um deals because our sales guys weren't getting it done not because it was their fault it's just nobody was buying ads and in 2001 and um and one of the tests that we had was an iq test this is a very long answer to your question but i'm gonna i'm gonna get to it it's a good story um so um i started picking up the phone and doing um doing what's called cpa cost per acquisition deals for our iq test and um we would charge 15 for the test and then we'd give five dollars to the the company that the advertiser that promoted it for us and it started taking off and um and what happens is all these guys look at each other and look at the deals and they and then everyone started calling me saying i want to run that i want to run that and um and it took off and in truth and that saved the company and in 2011 we went from three months away from bankruptcy and i'm sorry in 2001 in 2002 we won the webby award for the fastest growing site on the entire internet and it was a lot of it was driven by that iq test and all the traffic that was brought in and um and that's when things took off and we went from 1 million revenue to 4 to 16 and then by 2004 we were at at a run rate of 25 million and that's when now getting to um to the answer that's when we put ourselves in a position to be lucky for two reasons one because we had real revenue we were doing 25 million of revenue at that point on our way to 40 million the next year and number two because a a friend of ours was also an hbs classmate a year ahead of us had sold his company his name's chris michael to monster about six months prior and andy mckelvey the ceo of monster who basically controlled monster he was chairman of the board and and could do whatever he wanted he um uh chris knew that we were about to raise money at 100 million dollar value evaluation from excel who's now one of my main investors in branch out and chris also told andy this is happening and if you're interested in these guys excel is going to want 5x the return on their money therefore you're going to have to buy them for 500 million dollars later mark the market cap of monster was too small to support a deal that big so andy said no no we need to do this right now so we told excel give us a week james and i flew to to new york to meet with monster and it was a very quick process because we had real revenue and we already came vetted by um by chris and um and then james and i found ourselves in andy's office and we we had gone in there you know reminding ourselves we want a hundred million dollars that's a goal we sat down with andy and it was a three minute conversation he sat down and said guys i'd like to buy your company and i'd like to pay 80 million james and i looked at each other and said we'd like 120 million andy who's a 75 year old billion multi-billionaire sat back thought about it and then said guys i'm going to offer you 100 million and that's it and james and i at that point knew this negotiation is over this is not going any further um james and i and our best poker faces looked at each other andy you have a deal and 100 million deal was done what's that feel like to hit a goal that you set out to do nine years ago i mean you get a what did you do you get a little top hat and a monocle you know what it it's is that our matching outfit next time um i doubt if you are so you know what what's weird about when you sell your company is that it's not like you just won the super bowl it's like three two one yeah you know it's it's this process where we agreed to it and then you go through like two or three weeks of due diligence and then the legal stuff and all that stuff and then you get paid when everything you know when all that's done and then you know it hits your bank account and then you kind of go to your co-founder hey we did it but it doesn't have the same thing like you just won the super bowl like that moment but of course i mean it felt sure it felt great and it allowed me to um you know to do some nice stuff for my family to do angel investing and to have um you know some security for my family so it was kind of all right this is awesome let's get back to work yeah i mean we also had an urn out so we just kept cranking away with a business and um you know when someone offers you that much and um they ask you to stay on you know it was the right thing to do for us to stay on for another two years all right do we have uh one more question i'd like to talk a little bit about branch out a couple of years ago social recruiting was very hot and you were able to raise quite a nice amount of money uh recently most of the players have their own challenges and not only in social recruiting but all facebook-based businesses maybe how do you see this going forward and with mobile and with facebook-based businesses sure so um yeah so facebook made some major changes to the platform about a year and a half ago and um you know prior to that branch out was adding 400 000 new users a day with zero marketing i mean that's a big number right so um those were the fun days um of facebook they made changes right before they went public um to be able to better monetize the the feed with ads instead of free promotion for branch out and zynga and all the other app developers so um you know the lesson there is be careful when you develop on another platform that you don't control so um you know and you know in many good ways we were able to do some wonderful things with branch out and build a very big database and raise money and do some awesome things and helping people get back to work and then in other ways when you rely on another platform that is a risk that can you know that can really hurt your growth and you we talked about this and uh so when when facebook made a change branched out kind of got screwed for a minute and you had a great answer i was like were you devastated how did you feel and you told me something really amazing which goes along exactly with the title of this talk which is this [ __ ] is hard um i mean it'd be easy to be devastated and just freak out be like i'm i'm screwed i've raised 56 million dollars my business is i'm i'm [ __ ] i mean nobody nobody's gonna feel bad for me or should feel bad for anyone i mean it's um i don't i mean i i didn't feel bad i mean you just react to it right you you make changes um you've got to adjust and and you know you don't go home and cry about it you figure it out i mean inactivity leads to to to doubt and fear activity leads to confidence and courage and if you you know you've gotta you've gotta be active to be courageous and um and we made changes um based on you know the information we had and move forward and you did not dwell on it it was it was that was amazing of course we thought about okay what do we do now um so you know we were um pragmatic about it but um but you know we're not gonna i mean nobody wants to hear us crying or bitching i mean you just move forward yeah i mean when you told me this is part about being this is part of being an entrepreneur like i mean we called it this [ __ ] is hard this this this session because it is hard and that stuff's gonna happen um and things that are you know worse can happen too um you've got to know what you're getting into being an entrepreneur because it's not all about great techcrunch stories and and and meeting you know presidents and interesting people it's um you know most of it is a day-to-day grind and this stuff is going to happen and if you don't have the stomach to ride that roller coaster you really shouldn't be an entrepreneur and i tell people that to hopefully save them heartache later i love being an entrepreneur there's nothing else i'd rather do i love it i love the ecosystem i love working with smart creative people that's why i do this but you also have to know especially as a founder how much pressure is on you you can never shut it off you know you're always on you're always pitching your company and bad stuff is going to happen and i've had you know the highest highs and lowest lows all in the same day and this is you know one example in a big way um of stuff that happens as part of that journey so we're uh we're about out of time but is there anything that you'd like to tell the crowd that you wish that you would have known or been told when you were just getting just getting going i mean the things that have helped me um in my career from early days and these are just general not necessarily as a as a founder but you know i've tried to work harder than everyone around me i've tried to say yes a lot you know if someone gives you the opportunity to do something say yes whether it's a project at work or it's a business dinner or a networking event or whatever say yes and just get out there and do stuff and then you know i talked about attitude earlier but having a good attitude goes a long way not just as a founder and kind of rolling with these these punches but also early in your career because you know people want to mentor the smart people that have a good attitude that are willing to work harder than anyone else um you're going to stand out you're going to get the best projects you're going to get mentored by the best people so just i mean those three things can take you pretty far well before we wrap up um we do have um a cool little surprise we've got i think right now we should have one or two school buses uh outside so um once we wrap up here uh sales for startup has been kind enough to provide us with two buses that will be waiting out waiting outside for us right now so if you're interested in going to the after party which is only about a mile away we can all get on that bus together and head over there so please check out sales for startups they're bennett and the guys here are awesome they run a bunch of sales workshops so we got that going and i just want to thank you for coming this has been a really badass and thank you everyone for stopping by this has been a really really really great day thanks guys

so as I was uh saying earlier you guys have probably been bombarded with email from me um and I actually learned about it from our next speaker Neville madora so if you've heard of appsumo he's one of the guys who have made that so popular they sent out about 10 million emails a month and he's the uh brains behind it and it's been working pretty well uh in fact he has uh he's actually created one of the top selling copy writing courses in the whole world and just in the past two years it's done about 2 million in Revenue uh just from one single copyrighting course so Neville's going to uh touch upon copyrighting and um and how he's been able to use that to grow his business so let's go welcome Neville madora all right so what I'm going to talk to you today is this formula it sounds really scammy but like this formula that everyone in your company will write better but it's actually true so I going to give a little background on this so at appsumo and a lot of the other companies I'm involved with we send out a ton of emails I do a lot of Consulting for this for all sorts of companies just like yours big companies midsize companies and we see their email and their copy every day and they all make big mistakes so let me if I could figure this stuff out all right so this is a typical kind of email that you'll see in the morning when you're taking a dump checking your phone and you'll delete it pretty quickly right now the weird that is by the way how most people check their email and so um and so the funny thing about this is they have really high uh click-through rates because look at all this there's like view deal there's images everywhere there's text there's enough things on this page to probably grab your attention at some point right so probably click it but the problem is with these kinds of emails low engagement like there's nothing really to do with this email other than click out of it and get out of it as fast as possible the other thing is people are really quick to unsubscribe and if your business is dependent on email or you know how hard it is to get white label email delivery all that kind of stuff then that's money lost so I want to talk to you about a different style the total opposite of this kind of newsletter style email is the more personal looking yo y'all update my slides I don't think you'all did so this is a very personal looking sorry this is going to be a little interesting so this is a more personal looking email it's just text it's like from a single person so it'll be like at the end sincerely Neville you know it won't be from App Sumo it won't be from your company necessarily and so the thing about these is they have pretty good clicked rates it's not bad it's just a very small decline from the newsletter style but very high engagement very very high engagement and the cool thing is people hang on to every word that you write if you write cool stuff right so if your copy is educational foremost that's the number one thing that we put in so I had this uh business called House of Rave up until 2011 I owned a rave company I've never been to a rave in my whole life but I owned a rave company so light up and glow stuff and so here everyone told me like dude you have to send out emails like the money is in the email list like it's like your personal ATM they say stuff like that so I'm like okay I'll make some emails and basically what I did is I had all these people opted into an email list already that were paying customers okay so here were the old emails and check this out look it I was so proud of these by the way like I can't tell you how ecstatic I was to send these out and look it had a date on the top I designed that logo myself in Photoshop I made all this [ __ ] in Photoshop myself I took all these pictures I made those big buttons right just very clickable and like I said about these newsletter styles with lots of images what happened well it was like this so the list size was 7500 of previous customers that have already bought for me lots of opens that's that's much above industry average because people would click on them but here's the thing no [ __ ] sales so what difference does it make like it didn't matter it didn't matter if I got a ton of opens it just no sales and the profit because I would put discounts at the end of these I would do everything that you were supposed to put a discount at the end I would make like $40 in profit meanwhile vertical response my email service PR at the time cost $80 a month and well you just do the math that was negative $40 every time like I sent out an email every month it was it was stupid so then we went to this uh oh let me let me do something else I think I kind of screwed up my slides here so let me demonstrate for you the power of copy okay so I've got two envelopes over here and they're both addressed to my mom or we can say our mom for this situation right Mom okay so we're going to send her a little letter and all we're doing is just putting a little piece of paper a stamp address and send it off this first letter is going to say dear Mom I'm very busy right now I don't have time to call so I'm writing you with this letter you know Mom not only are you responsible for my very existence but you are the nourishment that has made my life Sparkle a so I'm under a lot of stress right now and it occurred to me that lately I haven't let you know how much I appreciate and love you sincerely Neville ah very sweet right fold this up put in the envelope send it off now we'll take the other identical envelope addressed to Mom also and we're going to write this same piece of paper same stamp same address same envelope dear Mom if I wasn't such a long way from home I probably wouldn't have the gut to tell you this but the following has been true ever since I was born you have made my life a complete living hell I'm jealous of every person on Earth because they all have better mothers than I do you are nothing but a wrinkled up old [ __ ] and the biggest waste of skin God ever created eat [ __ ] and die sincerely Neville P.S dad sucks too then we put this in the envelope and send it now as you can imagine there's going to be like a slight variance in those two envelopes right one your mom will be crying and happy in tears the other should be crying and never want to talk to you again except maybe Sam's mom because she probably hates him anyway Sam I hope you can hear that so anyhow that's the power of copy just a little bit rearranging the words completely changes the outcome and we've seen this on split test after split test after after split test it makes a huge difference and for those engineers in here like listen up because sometimes they'll write really shitty copy but we'll teach you how to fix that today so the next thing I did with that house of Rave remember remember these like these crappy newsletters they looked cool but they didn't perform well check this out this is the next one I started learning how to copyright from a guy named Gary Halbert he's dead now but he's had all this cool stuff I started obsessing about copyrighting every time I flew in the plane I'd look at Sky Mall and be like ooh I bet I can improve the copy on that one I bet I can improve the copy on that dog bed like it was really fun to do and so I went through and with the help of this formula that I'm teaching you today I wrote this email it doesn't really matter what it says right now I'll I'll I'll give you all this stuff later at the end of the presentation but basically this single email zero formatting it wasn't even in a table or anything uh zero no no real customization whatsoever except a few bolds and there was only really one link it says get your finger lights I was selling light up and glow stuff get your finger lights that's all I had run this promotion through a regular style newsletter before and it sold nothing I ran the same promotion like this the results same size opens were slightly less than the 35 before but 120 sales in the first two hours so I was very happy that day like I made a lot of money that day we sold out of all the product and people were ecstatic to try to get more so the only difference was I just wrote good copy on that one and I followed a style of copy and this formula that I'm about to teach you right here and and I just followed it exactly filled in the blanks and then flushed it out and that was the whole thing so does anyone know what this is already a has anyone ever heard of that a few of you Kim nice uh okay good so then everyone's going to be surprised well the magic formula is Ada oh y'all [ __ ] up my slides damn it okay we're gonna have to roll with this so here's the here's the Ada thing a i d a so what that means is attention interest desire action you may have seen this on that movie Glen Gary Ross where he's like Ada always be selling Ada right but this is actually a formula that copywriters for like 80 to 100 years have used successfully over and over and over and here's the thing I hate using stupid formulas like this but every time I try to divert from it it fails every time I use it it works so just of probably over the billion emails like I've written on that have actually gone out this always works it's unbelievable how well this works take a picture with your phone or whatever and like I said at the end I'll give all this to you so what you're supposed to do is the next time you sit down to write copy have you ever done this like you sit down your boss or someone is like oh write this email or sales or pitch this person and you sit down and you get like this like shitty computer typing itis where you're just like uh Dear Sir um we would like to introduce our product it is very technical it's like no one cares right so instead if you just use this adaa formula it will solve that problem for you so you get their attention grab their attention interest them with interesting facts uses stats examples uh numbers work very well testimonials work very well there desire make them come to the conclusion that I want this like don't try to like sell them let them like be sold and then come to you and be like o oo that that's really good and then at the end a lot of people don't do this tell them exactly how to buy do you have to click a PayPal button what's going to happen after that are you going to get something in the mail or get something in the email like what's going to happen so that's the basic outline of the formula so in one minute you can fill this out and have a basic structure of a sales page so this could be used for an email it could be used for a long form sales page it could be used for uh any sort of pitch to an investor or anyone this is the scientific way that you hit people's brains to make them sell attention interest desire action okay so for example I'm trying to sell you this Ada formula right now I'm not trying to sell you anything for money I'm just trying to sell you a concept right so what would I do for this well this is the structure I use for everyone no matter how big the company this is the formula we always use this is the formula that end up copying and two years later when I check on how they're doing everyone in the company's using this formula still because it's so good this this format so what we do is write a couple of subject lines over there the adaa formula subject two a formula that will make you and everyone in your company WR better so forth so forth and then for attention I would just tell you I can make you sell anything better with a small formula interest when this formula is applied to everything it usually has between a 60% and 300% increase in everything emails anything desire every great copywriter for the last 80 years has stuck to this simple formula cell and it works because it's been time tested and then action take out a sheet of paper and write the acronym Ada Aida on it or at least snap a picture with your phone okay so that's how I would sell you and I didn't really have to like do a lot of brain stuff over here it's just you just follow the formula so let's try to sell someone a concept using Ada Let's get someone to uh to drink more water I bring my water bottle up here no I had a prop but I forgot to bring it so if I was trying to get you to drink more water I could just say like hey man in the leopard skin suit I could be like like hey drink more water it's good for you right and you'd probably be like okay whatever yeah yeah like big whoop right now let's apply Ada to this situation God y'all really [ __ ] up my slides I'm sorry they were way better than this so so one of the things I could tell you is like hey man do you work out at all oh so you out so you go to the gym for like an hour each time or something like that well did you know that like if you drink more water in your system you actually get 30% more gains like the way your muscles work is they tear right whenever you lift really heavy weights so whenever they rebuild what do you think they're rebuilding with that 70% water weight they're always talking about so the amino acids react with the protein and the water to form muscle fibers and if you have more water and overabundance of water in your system you actually get 30% more gains this is like a proven fact okay so the next time you go to the gym all you have to do is chug like a liter of water before and you'll get 30% gains extra for the same workout right that's like if I filled up your gas your tank of gas uh in your car and took away 30% of it you'd be pretty pissed at that right well if you go to the gym and work out for an hour and I take away a lot of that time You' be pretty pissed also so just drink an extra liter of water before the gym and that's how I would sell it using the Ada formula now that's actually total [ __ ] I don't know if that actually works by the I just made that [ __ ] up but so don't go drinking a lot more water in the gym but I'm sure it can't be bad but I don't know if it works I took the slide out but whatever uh this is about length of copy copy is like a woman's SC whatever um uh grabbing okay so now so a lot of people have this trouble so especially in companies big companies like these older people will be like oh but you're you're young and creative you can come up with these things we can't come up with them Engineers will typically give me that example right and so here's the easy way to come up with here's another formula to get writing really well also I assume how many of you have like startup kind of companies where you have like a web page you spent time putting up a web page yeah a lot of them really really suck and if you notice like the design the the trend in design is to put a really killer headline and then like you know enter something here or whatever this is the way you find those so a specific result a customer want specific period of time and then address the objection that's it that's that's the whole goddamn formula it's super easy so check this out we'll do some examples running out of time so the uh end result customer once specific period of time and adjust objections feel free to move these around and mix and match or even try it out on your own company right now as I'm doing these examples feel free to write it out whatever don't pay attention to me so for example if you're like a consultant or something the main headline like the little quote unquote elevator pitch here's a one- sentence pitch okay increase the conversions are your Shopify store in 3 days or I'll refund your money okay that's pretty simple right like there's really really no misunderstanding that statement otherwise if you were just like Oh I'm a consultant on e-commerce and we try to it's just like use a bunch of buzzword and stuff you lose people and frankly it's also just boring so the other way is wipe away your debt before your tax return is due so the IRS won't call that sounds like a really scammy ad uh then another one is link up your social media account in 5 minutes so you can post in one place but share on all I think that's like buffer basically and then track where your customers click so you can increase conversions by this week that's kind of a crazy EG example so that's how you get these headlines like this is a really helpful formula end result customer one specific period of time address the objections I don't know what slide they have next so we'll see how this talk goes oh [ __ ] you took out the other good stuff all right so I guess I'm almost out of time anyway so uh if I helped you with one thing I want to tattoo this in your brain Ada okay a i d a it's like AIDS but Ada it's really really simple so the next time you sit down and write an email or something like that for example uh Sam made an autoresponder for this place which happens to be packed today and he used Ada on all those emails I don't know if you noticed that you probably didn't if you didn't know this formula but that's how he wrote them he had to write a bunch of emails in a row just use Ada on every single one of them and it turned out great so a a template oh God these are all old versions okay so if you want all the stuff I sent over here you can share it with your company or yourself or steal this presentation whatever you want to do you can text Nev to 50500 it's not going to collect your email or anything like that uh I had a link other here it's copyrighting course.com withk hustle con you can also just download it directly from there and uh that's it so thank you everybody appreciate it am I supposed to stand up here by myself what happens we got a Q&A right now so uh maybe 10 minutes of Q&A if there is questions for Neville come on down I've taken this course by the way oh thank you and it's very good so I'm a happy customer you will be too oh first question here we go uh Hey so I've been trying to learn this stuff over the past couple months and um one of the things that I'm a little bit concerned about is that you know no offense at all but like I feel like a lot of the emails I get that are like in this style just sound like like really weird and like douchy and like annoying it's like like the voice is just like I hate this person emailing me but it works so like where subtle cues as he's looking at me so like we get this objection all the time keep going yeah so like I what do you think about like I mean we just got this talk from Chubbies about like being authentic to your brand voice and like so how do if your values aren't around like this sort of attention grabby BuzzFeed type stuff like how do you how do you balance that with wanting to write great copy obviously okay so that's the number one thing that any company comes up to me and says they're just they'll see like app Sumo which is it's written in the voice it used to be written in the voice of this 500 pound Sumo and we make fat jokes and quite racist jokes actually all the time oh here go oh sorry I heard three sorry that was kind of a bad execution of that did no one see that thing on the bottom the first three people to bark like a dog get a free book ah nice I guess it's too small so anyways what what the thing is about that is whenever so people think you have to write goofy right they they associate this with like goofy like uh attention grabbing kind of [ __ ] like that not this isn't about linkbait type stuff like Viral Nova or something like that this isn't about that so A lot of times the stuff I write is actually very serious I don't think a lot of people see that for the banking sector and everything like that that stuff is serious but the underlying thing about it I told you the number one thing and sorry my slides are all messed up but the number one thing is educating the customer in those emails so if you have a boring style but you have a really if you're really strongly passionate about something you can be boring and still sell this in that same format so the adative formula doesn't mean act like a stupid jackass all the time it means it means it's you're hitting points in a customer's head like the psychological points to help them sell a little bit better so if you to app sumo.com pre P re y That's tracking software for your Mac um I actually got robbed a long time ago and we were trying to sell we're trying to promote this thing I was like how do I do this I uh it's not a very funny story about like how I got robbed and they stole my Maxs and it actually made me go a little bit insane right like you walk in your house and your like I'm looking through every room and like I would close my windows at night I I get really paranoid about everything so I wrote a whole story how that affected me so much like I felt violated when I got robbed I was just like this is like a [ __ ] thing to feel but that's how I felt and so I wrote about that and it was completely uh serious and and vulnerable and that sold like crazy also but it was a real story there was no humor there was no kind of like it was just a story so you do not have to act crazy or like some of the old direct response marketers that are I know what you're talking about scammy and douchy or like the whole IM marketing field avoid all that [ __ ] yeah I got you thank you anyone else how much time do you spend a week on your email marketing campaigns a lot of times I find with my marketing mix it falls to the bottom because it can be so time consuming email marketing campaigns what are you trying to do like what um it's it varies it depends on what I'm working on but pretty much anything like writing an entire email marketing campaign do you do it all once uh in a couple of days and then so so normally what I try to do is I try to break up the broadcasts as they come in so if this is if it's just like a one-time thing you write it as it is I Lally start with the templates I gave subject blah blah blah purpose of this email Ada um if I'm doing a big autoresponder I use Google Docs for everything I use Google dos for everything actually um and then I make I make that same template subject line blah blah blah and then I paste it like eight times let's say there's eight emails in that autoresponder I post the whole thing in a Google doc I write the first email and then I think how can I tie this into the second email and so forth and that's how I write it and then I load those all up at one time yeah so then when people read them they're like oh these flow together very well but if you wrote them individually and uploaded them to your email software or whatever it would be kind of complicated yeah and it usually takes uh like between an hour and two hours to write an email okay yeah or sometimes shorter if I know exactly what I want to write hey how's it going yo um I have a question for it seems like a lot of what you do is B Toc I'm guessing to mostly yeah so how do you do that for businesses to business because I this this same thing works for business to business same thing we we help people with the same thing all the time and they're always like oh this only works for B Toc think about it B2B means business to business there's still like a person at the end okay yeah it's not like some business entity there's a person at the end reading that [ __ ] boring email okay and they don't like to be bored also so you don't have to be wacky but at the same time instead of just talking about your company all the time what we've seen with salespeople little little side note salespeople in the B2B industry are the people who've used my course and increased their income the most I was kind of shocked by that but then I realized these people email or call 10 people a day right they're like hey we're from ACME bricks and we make the best bricks and we've been around since 1970 and we're based in Cleveland and blah and it's like that's not interesting okay but if they just send one simple email that kind of engages the other person in terms of like hey uh we see that you're using our competitor uh strawberry bricks we actually sell our bricks for 40% cheaper interested and they don't even write their company name or maybe to write like Acme or something like that that has the highest response rate and highest business getting rate that we've ever seen and so this stuff definitely works in B2B very very well it's more short copy than long if you're trying to just do that first introduction email you don't if someone introduces youself think about it in real life okay that's how you communicate with your email list in like in real life if I came up to you and I was like hey my name is Neville and I grew up in Austin Texas and blah blah blah BL and go on and on you'd eventually get tired and move away right unless I was really hot and which case you might come closer but but other than that like you you just want to say like a quick hello it's it's just quick and then something of real interest to them that's all it's quite simple I already gave the books away hi it's quick question about the templates um one of them had like four subjects yeah what was the purpose of that to get your mind J so if I was going to write like how to sell Ada or like come to hustle con it is is awesome that might not be the best way the the best angle to look at selling hustle con right it might there might be something different so I write four subjects just to like get my mind jogging and honestly you could write a lot more so it's like a brainstorming just kind of to get the to get going yeah and even at at uh at appsumo we made a plugin called uh King King Sumo that has a it's a headline plugin that you put into WordPress and instead of just typing in one title on WordPress you type in as many titles as you want so I'll type in like 10 titles and it'll automatically split split tests in a smart way uh the the right one and often times you'd be surprised and I'm not talking about once again like not not linkbait kind of things like oh number seven will blow your mind sadly that does work temporarily in this day and age but not for the long term and so uh so yeah you can do that and I write different subjects because I get different ideas it's really helpful very quick follow do you ever um do AB testing in email in emails yeah all the time yeah it makes a huge difference so do you use software for that or yeah well you can use I mean if you use infusion soft infusion soft has if you use aweber you can use aweber you can do ghetto forms of split testing we don't spend too too much time doing that because if you build up Goodwill with your whole email base they tend to open your emails all the time and so even if it's a crappy email you get some leeway like if if like I like Sam and if he you know tells me something if it's bad one time like he sends me a bad joke I don't just like get rid of him as a friend he has a whole like he has a whole repertoire with me right so I'll still look at his stuff and be like okay forgiven for that one but then we move on so so we do subject line test a little bit but we don't go like super overboard with it yeah all good I have a question for you actually my name's Eric so um I'm really curious to hear how long it takes you to write an email because uh earlier today we had R Rohan Dar from priceonomics he said that a blog post takes him 40 hours he's talking about the data collection yeah the data collection so kind of my question is related to you know your thoughts on including things things like data because you're kind of more of a Storyteller in your style oh but data is great if you have data use data by all means yeah and uh I mean what's your process I mean in terms of like start to finish and time and you know how you start thinking about writing the copy and so forth it completely depends what you're talking about right if if let's say we have a deal at absum and I want to promote optimizely right what I'll do is I'll I'll download optimizely I'll use some of the things I'll install it on my website usually that stuff takes way longer or like we've tried to promote Wisa before and we're starting to use wistia the the the video provider and I had to I use Wisa I uploaded my own videos I liked it I used all the features I embedded on my website that was all the data that I was looking for so that's data in my case thanks we have a one last question all right and thanks for the talk quick question um if I wanted to do a test what will be the smallest sample you would take of emails to try something like this uh you can send a newsletter style email yeah like one of those you know handwritten following the uh your your your formula uh but how many how many um delivers how many emails would you send just for one test are you just starting out or you have like a big thing going already never done something like that but it looks really interesting so but you have like a large email base already to go yeah yeah we have yeah huge yeah oh okay so then then so I mean appsumo will do tests of 10,000 people each well I wanted to kind of just try something small before it's yeah I've done I've done small tests on my own list where you send a thousand people one email and then a thousand people another email so you send one of those newsletter style emails where it's just like a Groupon looking email and say click here and then you'll see the difference between that and then you also see the difference between just like writing a a properly formatted email out here's the problem with testing a lot of people get really into this testing thing like oh what can I there it's like short-term gains okay so one of the things we noticed whenever we started do we started split testing the [ __ ] out of our headlines and our prices and the problem is um it worked temporarily temporarily there was like this time where it was it went like this but then people just started getting tired of it right when they start seeing different prices all the time for it like you open up an email one time you see a different price and you see it on the websites different price people get um people don't like feeling cheated right and so if you build up Goodwill over time you don't need to do as much split testing and so while the numbers show that you might get slightly higher click-through rates on just like a newsletter style thing that's great if that's all you're going for but if you want people to read your emails and interact with them and also like there's a cool trick that if you get people to respond to your emails at the bottom right hey respond to me let me know what your issue with optimizely is when they respond it kind of wh lists you so it goes more into the uh the inbox instead of the promotions box on Gmail right that was actually a slide I had thanks for [ __ ] it up guys and uh and so yeah so just try small test like that okay quick followup um if you were going to do a split test would you try two subjects or maybe four like from a thous it's it's it's just two versus four I don't [ __ ] know it doesn't matter doesn't matter doesn't matter okay yeah cool yeah another uh okay no I said you had another one oh no thanks a lot Neville I think we're out of time thank you appreciate it

so our next speaker is jordan harbinger he's the founder of the autocharm which is an academy that teaches emotional intelligence and confidence as a skill and they actually do high seven figures annually in revenue and he's also the host of a radio show that has close to a million monthly listeners which is really really awesome so jordan's gonna talk about some of the things that he's learned during the art of charm all right hey guys i'm jordan harbinger from the art of charm my company teaches emotional intelligence elements of confidence and relationship development but i didn't always do this several years ago i worked on wall street and i was an attorney which is one of the most boring jobs that probably a lot of you can imagine and i had a quote unquote mentor who i never saw he was never in the office and he was rumored to make more money than every other attorney in the firm so i knew something was up because he had a great tan for a brooklyn boy and that's there's that's not normal so one day he took me out for coffee and i'm pretty sure hr made him do it and he said ask me anything and i said all right because i didn't care about the job at the time i said how come everyone says you make more money than everyone else but you're never in the office and after a long awkward pause he told me that the reason he was out of the office and the reason the other lawyers were in the office at one o'clock in the morning on a sunday was because they were just grinding away doing technical work and he was out doing important stuff like golfing doing cruises and doing charity events with other people that actually brought business to the firm and so after i let that sink in it changed the way that i look at work forever because what that essentially means is that your people skills are going to trump your technical skills no matter what if you're billing hours and you're putting in tons of technical know-how that's great but somebody who can relate and bring in relationships will always beat you in terms of revenue and value to your company so that of course prompted me to ditch technical skills graduate from law school mail it in for the bar exam barely passing and focus on learning people skills for the rest of my life hopefully right at least for the next few years and that led to the art of charm and so essentially what i realized through that process is that people buy you they don't buy your product they don't buy your service they actually buy you they're looking at the way that they relate to you and if you look to the left and you look to the right you'll see people that are doing startups just like you but people don't care about that as a business owner and as a consumer of any kind i know that i'm just buying something because i like it because i like dealing with the person who sells it even with joel's buffer i use that you know why i use it other things probably do that but i like their customer service i like joel and i like what buffer does but in that order right so i think in for my purposes what that taught me is that buying is an emotional process it's not a logical one and if you don't believe me think about the last time you bought clothes especially if you're wearing a leopard skin suit or red jeans with red shoes it's an emotional decision it's not something that you do because it's the best thing to cover your body it's something you do because it makes you feel a certain way right exactly that's right so you do that and if you know what that means for you that means that your first impression in the way that you carry yourself is everything and of course what that means for a lot of you is that your first impression is something that you think you make when you open your mouth and that's not true your first impression is made when other people find you as a blip on their radar in other words when they see you and you can't talk to everyone at the same time but what you do communicate with all the time is your body and your nonverbal communication and so we need to make sure that that is nailed all of the time no matter what and the way that we're going to do that is every single day every single minute for the next two weeks every time you walk through a door you're going to straighten up with a string pulling up from your head you're going to straighten your back up and you're going to push your chest out and put a smile on your face and don't exaggerate it you'll look ridiculous even more so than the guy in the leopard skin suit who's not here anymore but you'll look ridiculous and so what you're going to do is make sure that that changes your physiology and that's going to change your mindset because it's going to change the way that people relate to you and it's going to change the way that you feel about yourself and of course what we know from that once you get good at that is you can start to change the way that you make eye contact and a lot of you if you're like me shake hands like this or at least you used to and it looks terrible and people notice that and if you notice the eye color of everyone that you speak with you're going to start making better eye contact with people and when you do that you're going to start to see the anxiety melt away and when the anxiety melts away you're going to carry yourself and sell yourself better than you ever have and sell your product better than you ever have because of course business to business people buy you they don't buy your product they don't buy your service they buy your personal guarantee and because they like trust and respect you and business to business it's the same thing it's because they like trust and respect you and for first impressions for most of us that means we need to step our game up big time which is what we do at the art of charm and as for first impressions this is my first impression for most of you i'm jordan harbinger i hope this was a good one and if it wasn't the most enlightening 4 minutes and 58 seconds of your life sam's giving refunds in the back thank you

Jack Smith is the founder of Vungle and Shyp.  Pretty impressive.  The crazier part is that he did this before he was even 25.  In his talk, Jack describes his tricks to getting sh*t done and highlights a specific way he automated his hiring process.

Hustle Con is a badass conference where the best non-technical founders (aka hustlers) teach how they got started and give practical advice on growing your startup. If you’ve heard of a hacker, well a hustler is its counterpart. Basically, it’s like a rock n’ roll version of TED, except not as hoity-toity. The catch? None of our speakers know how to code.

our next speaker is Jack Smith and he's the previous co-founder of bungle which does in that video ads and has raised 25 million dollars as well as the co-founder ship the on-demand shipping company that's raised 20 million dollars and fun fact Jack Smith's only 25 so yeah he makes us all feel great so today Jackson explained how he's been able to use automation to get a lot of done very quickly hi guys I was excited to come down today because hustling it's not a word that I'd heard of before coming to America but after I came to America I felt they really embodied kind of the philosophy of how I approach a lot of things and so I wanted to just talk today about automation or you could also call it like process optimization and just kind of a mind frame of how to think through approach to some different things about my background was that I moved to America three years ago now with my first startup Vangel and had had the opportunity to be involved with some really great companies and so seen different ways to approach business now when I'm talking about process optimization or automation it's really talking about how can we use kind of computer power or maybe low-cost labor to achieve a task faster because at the end of the day we're all strapped for time and so the time to use process optimization for me is when you break down that something that you want to do and you can clearly see that there's a bottleneck because there's no point in trying to automate something if the amount of time that you spend automating it is longer than it would have taken to do anyway you know but if you can clearly see alright this is a project I'm gonna do and this thing is just a real the real bottleneck in the process then what you'd want to look at is how can we just attack just this bottleneck and so an example that I want to give and because it sounds quite technical at the start but as I said it's just a frame of mind and it can be applied if you're just in your personal life doing trying to get startup off the ground anything it's the way of thinking through stuff the example I'm going to use is recruiting an office manager because it's something it's one of the first hires that you maybe do going into a startup it's something that talked about on the 500 startups mailing list just we were discussing it a bit and I said how we had hired our office manager fungal people found interesting so I thought I'd just share with everyone here if you are a start-up and you want to recruit your office manager pretty much what 90% of startup to do is they just shove it on crash of an ad on Craigslist and to an applicant this is what it looks like like you've just got a stream of just office manager for start-up office manager for a really exciting startup venture back startup blah blah use must be noise and all that it's going to result in like shoving an ad on Craigslist you're just gonna get like hundreds and hundreds of emails and so a colleague bottleneck in this process is well I've got hundreds of emails I've got to look through so when approaching this I fought it through in terms of alright how can we attack that bottleneck filtering through hundreds and hundreds of cold emails loads of this which is not going to be relevant and when you look at most of the ads on on Craigslist startups are recruiting the same kind of attributes for an office manager they want someone with good personality good communication skills and that can follow instruction how are you going to be filtering those just based on reading someone's called email you know that they've got a good personality doesn't come across an email so what I did I'm just going to show it again this is a basic example of what I'm talking about with automation or process optimization a basic example of how I filtered that process what I used is it's a free tool called um roof ooh here I just set up a basic form so just asking the person's name email address and phone number and you'll see it's asking for the phone number in this format now what we're testing here is can someone just follow basic instruction you see I didn't I didn't give out my email address in the ad so they're not emailing me they just fill out this basic form then what happened is I use this thing called zap ei now this is really awesome again it's quite basic to understand it's a bit like if if some people pearl that it's like if this then that and so what you do is I chose my waifu form on the left and a Twilio account on the right both for these like we perform it's free Twilio i think i loaded like $5 or $10 on my account and Twilio lets you spin up like a new kind of cell phone number in the cloud it's not your phone number it's just like a cloud phone and so why did is every time that someone filled out that form every time they filled out that form a text message would get sent to the phone number that they entered in the form and it's a stock message I wrote but because it says hey name I'm using the name that they entered in form so they say they fill out the form and like five minutes later I'll get a text saying like hey Jack like thanks so much for applying for office manager position can you just check out this link for me when you get a moment so again I didn't do anything I just did something like a couple of minutes to sow this thing it's all automated but so many people thought that it was me texting them like you again because it's a number in the cloud I wasn't getting loads of spam text back because I only saw them when I logged in it's not going to my phone but when I did login you see people like oh wow thanks so much for taking the time out to text me so you replied so fast etc but again this is me just filtering for stuff so I'm like hey can you go to this link and on this link your it was like a landing page again I just hacked it together really fast and I put just embedded a YouTube video myself and it's me just talking for like 1 to 2 minutes just like hey I'm Jack this is my company bungles very exciting blah blah blah about me because it's important that I show that I'm willing to put myself out there and then I use this again another tool I'll come back to these tools at the end so you've got them for efference but this one's called mail view and what it is is its embedded next to it so basically I was saying hey here's me can you just record me a one to two minute video of you and person just clicked record they just record a video and that's it and this is actually the girl that we ended up hiring as ahrefs manager because what it meant is rather than having these hundreds of emails from people I could just have a filtered down not just a few 1 to 2 minute videos to just flick through you know and just if we look at what we were judging in that role it's just in you can't even compare being able to judge someone's personality from like an email versus a one to two minute video like it's no-brainer you know so what we did here I don't have a bit that I think is important is just using Gmail canned responses is anyone that we rejected I think it's good to you know send them an email just saying like look thanks so much for taking time out to record a video but we weren't over an account another candidate because you know if they've jumped through all your hoops you might as well one it's only fair to thank them so these are the tools that I covered and this was just a short overview of how we hired an office manager but when you look at it it was just filtering by we need we've got a process there's a massive bottleneck which is reviewing loads of candidates what is the criteria judging their culture can they follow basic instruction and so we've set up filters to filter out those can they fill out a basic form with their actual phone number like if they didn't fill out their phone number they wouldn't have got the texts they're not going to proceed can they record a video that's just basic video you know and so in the end we only were judging people that could follow basic instruction and then with screening are they a good culture fit and how do they come across in that video and so hopefully you can apply that thinking in other areas you work so this is me I'm gonna soon like this is my website but then I'm soon gonna launch a resource called hustle X so this is why I want to come down because like hustling is really saying that I'm passionate about and here I'm just going to try and collate kind of resources and tips and stuff from bits that I've shared with companies I advise etc I was like well I might as well share that with everyone so this day I'll be launching soon thanks a lot guys

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
so right now our next speaker is Mark Oregon he actually flew all the way here from Toronto which is really awesome so we're happy to have him uh Mark's the founder of eloqua which is a Pioneer in Market marketing automation software and they actually went public and then were acquired by Oracle for $871 million in 2013 yeah uh now he's currently the founder of influitive which is another another marketing software company that has recently raised $16 million from Top VCS across the country so like I said again Mark's flowing all the way here from Toronto so let's give him a warm welcome Hustlers loud and proud Hustlers um I am so excited to be here among my people right all the hustlers here in the crowd seriously that's why I'm here I heard about this event um and I just said you know this is a place where I just have to uh speak and be here in an auditorium with 400 odd people that are just like me um so I am a career Hustler I am proud of it uh today I want to share a little bit of my story and some of the things that I learned along the way so what would you do hey your your company has got three weeks of cash left your people are tired some of your folks half your development team hasn't even been paid in about nine months and then one day you see a press release from your competitor who's raised over $50 million okay compared to your bootstrapped company who's raised nothing gloating over their new customer that they won right in your backyard what would you do about that how about this Fortune 500 company is is interested in in looking at your product but there's one problem they want to see your financials another problem is you've got maybe enough money to last for another month a couple of payrolls moreover they don't even have a budget to pay for your software what do you do about that and then you hit the end of the line you're out of money you're you know people aren't willing to work for free anymore your board is willing to extend you a Lifeline at some really honorous terms he $300,000 loan you got to pay back in a year it's only going to cost you 20% of your company what do you do so a lot of entrepreneurs when faced with this kind of adversity they throw in the towel they're stuck down there on the mat but great Hustler entrepreneurs like some of the people here I hope right here in this audience they power through those challenges and that's because they've invested in developing their mindset and knowledge and training so that they could be a champion and that's what I want to talk to you guys today I want to talk to you about how to develop the right mindset your knowledge and your training so that you can be a serious professional career Hustler and before I go on does anybody know the story but around that dog over there running there with uh with Rocky up the steps yeah it's pretty cool story yeah so uh so Sylvester Sloan actually sold that dog in order to make enough money to um you know get through some very lean years and when he got a small amount of money because he insisted on starring in Rocky even with his facial deformities and all kinds of stuff um first thing he did was buy that dog back right so that is a hustler and someone I respect greatly so this is my story uh I cannot sing or dance just like Rocky you know Rocky told Adrien that's why he fights he can't sing or dance um uh also um unlike Rocky I I don't have a six-pack but you didn't know but you would never have guessed um one thing I have done I'm proud of is is having created billions of of new category value right not just from the companies I built but all the derivative companies all the competitor companies all the service companies that have together made up several billion dollars of value which I think is super cool uh created thousands of jobs but most importantly lots of newly minted Hustlers who are going out building their own companies right now I'm so proud of all of them um so I'm going to tell you a little more about that first my Hustler Journey so it started uh here when I was seven or eight years old and I was selling a pill out of my parents medicine cabinet um uh so I got my start as drug dealer um and then I straightened out and and I got into the pornography business um not as a producer I was a distributor of of high quality pornography tapes that I found in various places um in grade seven and then I got into the custom uh software development uh business basically went uh door Todo in Office Buildings in Toronto and said hey do you need any software done um and actually attempted to code along with a partner I learned very quickly that I was a hustler not a hacker at that point uh reinforced again when I started uh doing a door to door painting thing just like just like Gabe um interesting how how similar our our careers went um realized I was useless with a paintbrush but uh pretty good as a as a hustl and sales guy so um uh I did spend some time in a respectable job and before they could fire me I started eloqua in 2000 um and now at a company called influitive so I'm going to focus today uh on the eloqua story particularly the early lean bootstrapped years um and and hopefully there's some you know important lessons that you can learn out of that um so a little bit about eloqua eloqua was um uh you know Sam said a Pioneer in the marketing automation space one of the first real software as a service companies founded just a few months after salesforce.com um in in January 2000 U it was a bootstrap company uh we raised just $166,000 of equity um along with the aformentioned uh debt at very onerous terms um and we got profitable on that ran it profitably for three and a half years um before uh raising some Venture Capital um it did end up iping and got sold to Oracle for around $900 million um now I'm running um influitive which is in The Advocate marketing category this is going to be I think a way bigger category than cloud-based marketing automation you've heard a lot of stories today people saying how important their customer Advocates are to building their business the importance of Yelp reviews the importance of referrals right so what we're doing at influitive is we're helping companies mobilize their armies of Advocates or customer Advocates developer Advocates um employee Advocates to generate more of those referrals references case studies social media mentions all those things are so critical to building a business effectively today I think this is a multi-billion dollar category so watch the space but we won't be talking much about that because I'm going to talk to you about some I think really cool stories um from my uh experience at at eloqua so uh let's start with round one uh body Blow from the board right so my uh chairman of the board dear chairman uh used to tell me in early days of alqua don't worry about the bottom line don't worry about it just keep the sales growing up and to the right hit your plan right and we'll be there for you I'll take care of you well he took care of me all right you know when the chips were down uh we had a really difficult decision to make I didn't even tell you the worst part of it if we didn't pay back that $300,000 in one year okay we'd have to pay another 20% of the company right this is not for Equity this is debt we have to pay the whole thing back it was absolutely a horrible deal so when fac between that and imminent death like what do you do well here's what we did we took the deal because my death is NE that isn't much fun but we resolved to get even and get even we did um because when uh the time came for us to raise uh Venture Capital those early vultures um all got bought out at a loss and they could have made a thousand times their money so uh for those budding Venture capitalists in the audience just because you can turn the screws doesn't mean you should turn it all the way okay um so now Hail Mary so uh Winnipeg and winter um so so this is you know again three weeks literally I'm serious 3 weeks I mean it was looking really Bleak saw this press release absolutely livid um because the company in question was Manitoba Telecom systems based in Winnipeg okay now I don't know if there any geographers in the audience here but it doesn't get any more Canadian city than winter Peg all right and here they were rubbing it in our faces that uh they won this amazing customer and here we were almost dead right what do you do so here's what I did I guess the email address of the person listed in the press release send an email and saying I don't know what those guys are doing for you but whatever it is we can do things a lot better and we're Canadian we're like we're like your people you got to at least give us a a hearing okay so she didn't actually turns out turns out that she wasn't as happy with this company this competitor called new channel the Silicon Valley company that raised $48 million wern't actually that happy with them I said hey want you want to do a demo we did a demo worked out great they said why of you fly out here March 2001 in the middle of a raging snowstorm to Winnipeg um we did the demo they loved it we got a check literally 4 days before we were going to have to kick the bucket is an amazing story um and that's what gave the company a few more months of life so we said now that's interesting right this great big amazing company who raised all this Venture Capital may be a little more vulnerable than we thought maybe there are other opportunities in the new channel customer base that we could take advantage of and so they had their star customer on our website case studies Galore press releases okay and it was a division of GE called Global exchange services um and so we pounding on those guys emails phone calls everything we had to do to get their attention Okay and finally we did get their attention we got an email back and they said hey sorry guys unfortunately um you know your timing is interesting we kicked out new channel but we're going with yet another competitor you know and and we're not you know we we just don't have time to process you know more um more vendors I'm like okay um but uh you know we talked about all our advantages they didn't listen so we're not getting anywhere so what do you do well we send an email right to the CEO of the company he say seeo I don't know what your dunderheads are doing down a in marketing right but we clearly have a Superior Solution and they won't even give us a fair hearing right well it worked CEO went down to marketing team and say hey at least go see their go at least go see their down Mo come on um so they gave us half an hour and September 11th 2001 our demonstration was scheduled with gxs yeah right in the middle of the demo the everything went silent and we don't know what was going on and they said uh I think we're going to have to reschedule this demonstration for another time um that demo did get rescheduled showed them the product and says you know pretty good product guys it's pretty good but you know you're missing these one two three four and five features and you know the other guys have it and so you know I'm I'm sorry it's the end of the line for you and so he said well just one more thing what if we were able to deliver those five features for you over the weekend I said well if if you did that we'd buy your product but that's impossible um I said well um Monday more Monday at noon let's schedule another demo so and this is where the hackers came in they worked all weekend 70 hours straight hardly any sleeping in the office got it all done right showed it to him on Monday uh they were flabbergasted we went down to gathersburg Maryland showed them the product they said this is great we have only one problem the budget has been cut and so we cannot buy your product anymore I'm like this can't be um so I said there's got to be some money in here somewhere this is General freaking electric and and it turns out there was money there was money because there was an all digital initiative at this company and so all the money that they were going to save on Staples and paperclips was available so literally we sold it to the paperclip budget for four months um and uh and and that's what uh saved our our company again for another three months so then we got really aggressive we go holy cow there's a real opportunity here um and so we started pounding on all of these our competitors customers that are on the website and we won three more of them and so then new channels took all their customers down all the logos down so then we wrote a script to go and find them and we started pounding on more of those companies and we won six more um and then our competitor went out of business we won most of their customers and we became profitable um and we stayed profitable for another three years um before we raised venture capital and we raised Venture Capital mainly to buy out those jerks who gave us that terrible uh offer in the first place all right so that's my story um so one of the things that you'll you'll notice that's a Common Thread through all of this stuff right is that there wasn't any really special tips or tricks or tactics or even strategies you know that were important to make this this all work right and in fact even the tactics that I used back then AR aren't even going to really work today you know Sam asked me to talk a lot about tactics and tricks and tricks and I thought about it and I thought you know the most important tactics I can talk about is how to keep you mentally focused how to keep your head in the game how to get up off the mat right because all of you guys are starting companies or are going to start companies are going to face some of the adversity that I did so I want to tell you about some of the ways that I got through it with the help of some great mentors that I've had over the years um so the most important I think first is to charge your brain with customer and user pain okay so this is something you can't delegate to the product people okay the product people who want to go and interview the users and customers and do the customer development you can't delegate all that you need to talk to customers and users yourself if nothing else but you need the confidence need the confidence to go and press on right so at at you know when I was starting alqua I talked to all these sales reps whose lives are being destroyed by the disruptive innovation of universal call display okay and they weren't able to generate the leads that they needed in order to be successful and I heard about broken marriages and I heard about just really terrible things um and that's what gave me the strength to go I knew that if I were just to build this product I know that I was adding real value to the world um and it kept me going through dark days at influitive literally interviewed 800 plus Advocates and asked them a simple question what would it take for you to Triple the amount of advocacy that you do for these companies and products you care about right and they told me and so I know that if I can solve that problem I know that we're going to be successful right my friend Scott Cook is one of my mentors from uh from in I mean he was at so many kitchen tables watching people do their budgeting right to understand that pain because that pain is what will charge your brain in the dark times okay stronger leadership every day um if you think of yourself as a career Hustler right if you think that you're just you're on a a long journey that might even go through the current company that you're in changes your mindset right so if all you do is just get a little better every day a little stronger your leadership gets better your hustling skills get a little bit better every day just like Milo of Catona right the ancient Greek wrestler who got Strong by first picking up a baby a calf and every day as that calf fattened he got stronger until on the day of the Olympics he carried a bull over his head right that's the kind of mindset that I think keeps you focused so even if you have a setback right you know that all you have to do is just get a little bit stronger every day um which is reinforced by my first uh mentor and the OG Hustler Mentor for me Vince relli and and what he taught me and really helped me out a lot was that you know you dream of growth right you dream of having the best team you dream of having these amazing numbers that investors will salivate over but you can't manage that dream right the only thing that you can manage is your own activity right so of all you do is just make your activity a little bit better every day better quality and quantity of activity every day you're eventually going to win right so Victor Frankle is one of the few people to survive in the Holocaust concentration camp where he lived one of the very very few and he credits that to the mindset that he developed right and one of the things he said was that we're unable to no long we can't change the situation anymore right we can change ourselves we can challenge ourselves to change right and so that means I mean not just increasing the activity quality of activity but it also means you know improving your education and your training and your knowledge right so you're not a victim of the situation you're in you're totally in control and I found that these are the things that really got me through it and so that I could stay focused so let's talk a little bit now about training let's talk a little bit about your Hustler personality and skills and so the thing is if you're a hustler and CEO you actually have two different roles right you're the leader of your company you're the CEO of a company you got to develop those leadership skills but you're also a hustler and chief or chief and Hustler I don't know something like that um and so you know that person there on the left and for those people who know the 18 that's face from the 18 um you got to go and develop those Hustler skills and I think one of the things that's really important is Relentless optimism right optimism attracts people and it's a skill you can learn it you can train yourself to see the glass half full and that's a little different from you on CEO seat you got to be a little more realistic but when you got your Hustler hat on right your job is to see a brighter future for yourself and your company right and again that attracts people and that's really the job of a hustler isn't it right the job of a hustler is to attract resources you need to attract great people and cash and customers and partners right so you need to be an attractive person right so if you don't look like George Clooney like me then you got to really work on it personality um so the second thing is you know really care about people in their success we've heard this from other speakers their success comes before your success always right in fact I believe that the only real value we could take out of life is a small fraction of the value that we create for others right so really work on helping people um and you'll do well you got to hit the books you got to learn the classics of interpersonal relations okay uh my grandfather made me read how to make friends and influence people when I was 13 I'm really glad he made me do it I reread it every three months because I screw up all the time right so the basics right make people feel important don't criticize condemn or complain right smile all those things are really important I mean there's lots of great books on it um you know the The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People all that kind of stuff um those are critical Hustler skills I'm really excited about this art of charm I heard about today it sounds like that's taking it all to the next level I think is uh was was really cool my wife would wonder why I'm taking it of course um so you know hard work goes without saying right the dream is free all of us can dream for free the hustle sold separately all right um the thing I want to talk about working hard at that I don't see enough of in young Hustler entrepreneurs is networking I spend 20 to 25% of my time networking help help people connecting people right um and really you know you know really really learning uh how to do that better um and so I will I'll do crazy things in order to meet the right kind of person who I think can kind of help me out uh I have a little formula that how you know to try to allocate my time for networking 50% of the time focus on networking up okay let's face it there's probably no one else in your company that will be able to have that critical connection that senior person that can change change the destiny of your company than you not someone on your board of directors not your board of advisers you need to go and develop um those relationships but it's not all networking up right you do need to network with your peers and down too look it for those people who are rising up quickly right I met a number of people here in this room that are like that those are great relationships that you're going to need later on in your life um Hustlers never stop learning um and this is not just sort of like those skills that you need for your business I mean everything from really knowing your Market well um to all the different functional areas of a business I mean th those are important not just for running a great business but it lets you be a chameleon it lets you when you're in a crowd of folks that you can blend in and you can speak their language right you can you can speak to what they're excited about hearing about instead of just you talking about your own company um so that's another reason why I think learning is important as well as tactical Hustler skills right so there's new Hustler technologies that are coming out every day right I mean my head of sales uh told me about a month ago hey we're taking this Advanced course in using LinkedIn you know maybe you should go and do it I'm like LinkedIn I'm a master of LinkedIn I've got 4,000 connections I know Reed Hoffman I'm like number 11 I'm the sorry member number like a thousand and something right it's like yeah you never know you might learn something and you know what I learned a ton there's a lot of Advanced Techniques that I would never have guessed is possible in in LinkedIn so you know you really can never uh never stop learning um finally I mean what I strive to be is like the Zen Hustler okay so outside externally I'm like right um all energy and optimism and you know exuding that right but inside right the picture of calmness and Stillness okay so that you take things in stride you know you're on your journey right every day you're getting a little bit better um so I try that I not always successful um in that but that's what I strive for so I'm just going to finish off with a saying from a a great Hustler philosopher Rocky Balboa and um he once said this if this is something that you want to do and this is something you got to do then you do it thank you thanks a lot Mark I think we have time for one or two questions if you want to come down I actually have one question myself so my name is Eric and uh you mentioned uh mentors a few times in your presentation I just wanted to see whether you could talk a little bit more about how you involve mentors in your business and your life yeah I I think mentors are crucial um you know the greatest CEOs out there um that you would think of as being real masters of their craft have lots of mentors okay Steve Jobs had them matter of fact I've talked to his mentor before uh Jack Welsh did um so I have I have several I have an executive coach that I work with every week um particularly on management and Leadership issues and communication issues where I have challenges um and uh I also have uh people that from all the different areas of the business whether it's uh how to generate more alignment sales marketing product you know I have people that um that that I work with work with um I'm really aggressive about getting mentors I think it's really important um and so I'll get in people's face until they're willing to deal with me um I've I've flown to all kinds of uh crazy places um in order to catch people while they're flying and then you know they're going to spend much more time with me because I tell you you know half an hour with someone who really really knows what they're doing can save you you have no idea how much grief um so I think it's a critical thing for for you know uh really for anybody who wants to be successful uh to you know to to be seeking out mentors and I also think it's important to be a mentor yourself right I mean that's why I'm I'm here that's why I'm doing this right I'm doing this because it's forced me to package up the things that I've learned over my life and to try to express it in a hopefully a simple and you know energetic format right and so I learned a lot by by building this this is a completely brand new presentation for me um so I think it's just if you want to be um if you want to be a great learner it's also important to teach as well thanks Mark thanks hey y Mark like you knowy pretty good presentation there you know very aspiring oh seriously it was great thanks so um I I've been working on my company for the last year I I had a restaurant for 10 years sold it Philadelphia and uh and moved out here to begin this new Venture called lots of stops and um so red Lean Startup doing what I need to do and putting it all together create an executive summary and I get introduced to uh a VC I sit down and uh he liked the concept and such and he lovingly beat the hell out of me huh he's a good guy yeah I I see I see that now but it really it stopped me for like two weeks oh like you know so my question is like I think lots of people experience that sort of thing and my question is what what would you say to self-generating yourself under those situations like do you have any any things you employ do you phone a friend you know yeah say it's a great I mean the first thing I would I would um look at is who's giving me the criticism um no gu true I mean there's there's some people who um you know you got to take them really seriously and there's other people where frankly you can rush it off so I think that's the first thing assuming that it's some somebody that you know you you really respect um you know I mean first of all I I would be in a in a first of all very a thankful kind of mindset because you know at least this person had uh cared enough about you and cared enough about your idea to give you that feedback right Mo most VCS will actually do the opposite and will just say um oh yeah s sounds great right sounds great call us when you get more attaction right and and you're like oh great he really liked it well no that's actually not not true so I mean that person actually cared um so I I think I would be I'd be really thankful um and you know take it as a a bit of feedback to to go and and get a little bit uh better um I I think it is important to have people to talk to um that that that's not your spouse and whatnot because generally they don't understand um so one of the things that I have for example is I have kind of an U I call an informal board of directors so I have a number of startup CEOs that I get together with every month and and that's where we'll kind of [ __ ] about this stuff and and and kind of feel better um about it it's a bit of a cathartic release and you're talking to people who actually understand a little bit about for example raising money and and uh and can be helpful so yeah I do think it's important to not kind of suffer in silence you do need to have people to talk to yeah thank you and I I did um once I did pick myself up it's kind of like you develop a thicker skin so when it happens again like for me I just continue to put myself out there I think so and I I do have a meeting with the same person in two weeks so congratulations that's no I I think that's great and you know what I mean there's a there's a saying that I've heard recently which is it only takes one to fall in love only takes one to fall in love soes it means is look these VCS I mean they'll they'll take hundreds of meetings a year and they're going to fund like one company or two companies I mean you could do everything perfectly right and for some reason that you don't even know about Something's Happened in their personal life that's why they're passing they're not going to tell you that right they're just going to make something up they're just going to say yeah we don't like your cost of customer acquisition it's too high you know whatever I mean they're just making [ __ ] up um so you know it is important to go out there and keep pitching and pitching and pitching all the time now if you keep hearing the same thing over and over again okay you gotta you got to fix your pitch um and but uh you know there's a lot of great stories of of entrepreneurs both in the high-tech area that we're in or everything to like Colonel Sanders in his Fried Chicken right where you know they pounded the pavement over and over and over again and eventually they found success got it thank you cool thanks uh last question hello Mark uh great energy like you said vibrant uh my question goes more for like the team building when you first kind of like started eloqua how did you go and kind of like some of the lessons so first off the first part is actually how did you go around building the valleyball team and then the second one is if you had like Pearls of Wisdom around the team yeah I think of Team a lot um at eloqua uh the only choice we had was to hire all our friends um so um but I mean the good thing is I I went to good school and we had some pretty smart friends so I was pretty lucky I mean we we had some amazing people that that joined our our team uh at at the early days and because we had bonds of of friendship and because we were all young I was I was 25 when I started aloa and I was the oldest person in the company um so there were a lot of young people that were frankly just excited to um you know to show the world what they could do right instead of being stuck in a big company and that is one lesson that I took with me um every hiring mistake that I've ever done every single one was when I hired experience um which is a remarkable thing um because you know all the VCS are going to tell you oh you're going to hire the best people you can find and you do have to hire the best you can find that doesn't mean you hire someone who can do the job in their sleep so on my team today my head of sales Global head of sales has never run Global sales before my head of marketing has never run marketing before uh like the whole thing he's done every part of the marketing job but never done the whole thing my head of BD is the first time had a BD um so they're excited to come to work every single day because they're learning and growing and one of the things I've learned is that the learning the learning and growth for for really great people like for for class A people learning and growth is worth more to them than even a huge paycheck and I I've had people on my team that have taken literally 75% pay cuts to come in and join because they feel like they're going to learn so much right that in the long run that they're going to do well so I me I I could talk for ever about how to build a team but there's one thing I've learned that I that I think is really important is they they've got to have a lot of fun to come into work it can't just be about paycheck thanks thank you Mark

I Marty ramamurti I am now the founder and CEO of lamoid will i'll tell you what Lou Moyes I am an engineer by education I'm masters uncle in software engineering so I build products at Microsoft before this I worked on Xbox Live visual studio and the CLR the common language runtime building a bunch of products there and then joined the netflix movie streaming team which built the software which lets here watch Netflix shows and movies and stuff and then I started Co founded this company called true and go which is actually an intimate apparel startup where we apply a machine learning algorithm to go with fit women online and from there it applied to Y Combinator got through the program launched lamoid we launched late last year and since then just been building and scaling the business so what is lamoid lamoid is a try before you buy service for gadgets so we started in photo video gear entirely focused on consumers who want to try and buy really high-end gadgets medium to high end gadgets but didn't wanna splurge right away so we provided a rental model and then if you are interested you could buy but there's no commitment to buy and we worked with secondhand stores used electronic stores to get inventory from them in a more ties the whole thing so that's kind of how we started the business and like most other startups we had no money to start with we basically said okay we have to go figure this out in scale out the business and I have no background in sales or marketing and so we just had to go figure this out so these are five lessons that have been relevant what I've learned building lamoid most of these might not be applicable to you if they are great if they are not and if there's anything else that I can help with let me know offline and we can chat what are the five things if you're going to talk about building things things that do things that don't scale you've heard this before everyone talks about this what are the things that didn't scale that we tried in the beginning what worked what didn't we made a ton of mistake and that's the only way we could learn some of them worked and we applied more resources towards it some of them didn't work spectacular failures and we learn from that and moved on getting the basics right what are the basics in our business what worked for us and what did we apply what our happy customers how do they help you with marketing standing on shoulders of giants for us what what does that even mean and finally Ohio will come to that so doing things that don't scale when we started out we were renting and selling cameras lenses things like that I used to be a photographer I had expertise starting out the business so how did we go reach out we would do the absolute craziest things I am a runner I would run and right then about last year they started building the Bay Bridge lights and lots of photographers used to show up and we would go when I was running around embarcadero I would hand out cards to all of these guys and I would say you should come check out lamoid and try this out his service and for the first month I think people were just like I would see them just toss out the cards and just keep moving and then they would come in they would actually try out the server say like oh yeah I heard about you guys and they were just like pay attention to us and that kind of worked out in the beginning we would go talk to community colleges and we found out that most community colleges had issue rooms where students can get gear for free but these issue rooms had incredibly dated equipment so we were able to get these students to go talk to their teachers and convince them to talk about us and work with their issue rooms to provide gear to them so that worked out really well for us this is something that I would pick up the phone and just start calling and get people to come on board we would when we send out cameras we would send out lamoid straps along with the cameras when customers saw their other customers they crying out gear they would say what is lamoid and they would come check out the service we've had a number of customers just come in because if I saw somebody where a loom wide strap I mean these are like very simple things but it just ended up working out pretty well for us and just scaling out the whole side of things every time we sent out a box we made sure we had a really good Packaging experienced people love opening the box it's really pretty and we put in a card there this is send this card to somebody else you really like and they'll get a discount they can all fly in referral program kind of thing and that worked out really well because the card was beautiful and they wanted to share it with everyone else and we got traffic through that just figuring out ways in which you can get the initial set of customers without having to spend too much on marketing or spend anything at all meetups calm stuff like that those were the ones that really work for us to start building a foundation for the business and of course once you get enough traction or you get a little bit of PR you can kind of scale build and keep building on it but these were the initial things have worked for us getting the basics right everyone talks about like hacking your way into getting million users for us one of the things was just focusing on the fundamentals we are an e-commerce company so we want to go measure the absolute important metrics measure everything and you will not believe the number of startups who I talked to would be like yeah we yes we have customer acquisition numbers LCV aov but our startup is a little bit different everybody comes and tells me that their startup is a little different and they can't measure the number is exactly like how they're supposed to yes you might have exceptions but more often than not you're probably the norm somebody else is doing something similar to you are so go and measure every aspect of your business I mean it's not impossible yes it takes a little bit of work but put in the effort to the point where if you are non technical or if you have employees are the people in your company who are non-technical you want to be able for them to just be able to look at the numbers it doesn't have to be pretty but generate a few scripts and you know push them into some UI something that they can all look up so build measure everything that you can in my case we look at how much are they spending where are they coming from how much does it take to acquire the customer how long are they retaining what does the churn like basics of the business get those right first and then you can figure out other growth tactics and hacks in there the basics have always worked out pretty well for us and just optimizing that our referral programs print money for us it's worked out really really well we only started this a month ago and we were kind of everybody told us yeah referals everyone's doing referrals it's not a big deal its kind of saturated turns out it's not I mean this is still one of the good ways to go acquire customers just the fundamentals and focusing on that worked out really well for us customers when I purchase from amazon or when i get a box shipped to me i would never ever send them a thank you note but it turns out that a lot of our customers actually write handwritten notes like this whenever they're traveling travel is a big segment for Lou muy where we ship gear to their hotel destinations if you are say vacationing in Hawaii we ship a box to you and once you're done you can ship it back to us right from there without having to carry gear with you and so people when they travel they get a postcard the right stuff and they put it back in the box it's just amazing to see why customers would do this we use we collected a lot of these cards and handwritten notes they get their kids to go right in the boxes and stuff like that so at one point we just had a white board full of just these cards and then we said okay we're going to just create a tumblr that just puts up all of these and customers now love contributing to that tumblr they would send us a card and then they'd be like can you put it up on that blog you have a blog for it and that kind of became this competition where people who just want to like write thank-you notes and write stuff or they would talk about us on Instagram and then we would put it up on tumblr and they'd be incredibly excited about it it was just one of these like really easy channels for us to pay back to the customer without having to really do much about it so in general for us if you have happy customers they are basically free marketing for you they would talk about you I remember I think our fourth ever paying customer they came on board and that guy single-handedly referred 11 other paying customer stood it and pretty high ovies for each of these guys and we didn't do anything we just had like really good service and he would just come back and tell his friends he posted on facebook and people just came through because of that so if you have one is do you need to have happy because basics of any business but when you do have them make use of them they'll be happy to spread the word because they have friends who might be similar and they want to tell them about you Yelp it's again something that we started looking at about two months ago same thing everyone said okay it's really saturated everyone's on Yelp what's the big deal we put it up on yelp now we had at five stars really good service there people write about us they are the you know every time they have a good experience they go talk about it a lot of customers find us on yelp it's it's amazing the number of people locally find us from there they would call us and Yelp has a great metric system they tell you how many people have looked for directions how many people called from the page itself and stuff like that yelp who's worked out really well for us and it does really well when you search and when you find a service like ours same for facebook customers tell their friends through no Facebook itself we boost we promote those posts those work really well for us reviews food photographers mom photographers mom bloggers we basically work with these guys either as an affiliate basis or we work with them as an influencer give them free gear rentals for a weekend and they would just do a review for us it's the ages works out and instead of us having to build platforms build long form content build all of this we basically working with these guys to just make it happen and that just works out really well and finally Ohio what happened was when we first started out the business law and for investors came in and said I know who your target audiences it's all gadget geeks these are people maybe San Francisco may be in New York who are really interested in high-end gadgets and they have disposable income they want to try stuff you're basically looking at our tech folks in the coastal areas but it turns out that a predominant number of customers are bang the middle of the country Ohio's one of our biggest areas of acquisition for us and we were wondering you know every time an investor would come in and say that we dig up the numbers we like actually that's not true this is like you know we have customers from Idaho Kentucky Louisiana middle of the u.s. so we started looking at what was really going on and called up you know a few customers and it turns out that we know we rent and soil gadgets the nearest best buy for a lot of these guys is about 40 50 miles away they don't want to go up there and buy something and they have no experience they want to be able to test it out for a few days and the local rental stores have all shut down and they no longer there the brick-and-mortar stores and so they place an order from the website to business days it shows up with a return label in the box they love the service so it turns out that the middle of the u.s. is actually a pretty big audience for us even though on just on the first appearance it doesn't seem like it so always try and understand who your target audiences it might not be the people you think they are and if they aren't go figure out what you can do for us we are figuring out fulfillment from the middle of the u.s what do we do in that case for east coast and for west coast we figure it out the you how do you get to the middle of the country in about a day's time frame the logistics operations that side of things so figure out who your target customer is it might not be the people who you absolutely are sure about and if it is in course correct and make it happen depending on who your customers really are so that's really what Ohio is about and that's basically it I would love to reach out and talk to you if you are interested in how we work or just want to know about lamoid i am at RT are calm or rtl you my comms my email address thank you

foreign founded his first company when he was 18 and then sold that at 21 and followed by that he launched cow finder where he bootstrapped that business to 25 million dollars in sales without bringing in a cent of outside funding After exiting cow finder gave started up shift which is a growth stage accelerator program to help startup scale sales teams in months as opposed to years in the past six months of ship graduates have raised over 52 million dollars in funding I first heard about Gabe when Tim Ferriss retweeted this amazing blog post about how he bootstrapped Cal Finder right when I saw it I knew we had to have him here so today Gabe's going to give the lowdown on how he's been able to help teams scale their sales teams so please give a warm welcome for Gabe hey good afternoon so my name is Gabe founder of upshift Partners we help start up scale sales and make money so like many of you I'm a entrepreneur and I'm here today to share some of the lessons that I learned going from an idea in a spare bedroom to multi-million dollar company without ever having to raise a penny of outside funding to say that my journey here was unique I think would be a kind of an understatement so I didn't go to an Ivy League school in fact dropped out of college never raised a penny of VC funds bootstrapped it on my own credit cards and I also grew up on a hippie commune in Northern California where we didn't have electricity we didn't have a television we didn't have internet and I didn't have a whole lot of examples of I guess successful entrepreneurs in fact that the only entrepreneurs that I knew on the hippie commune were farmers but yet eight years ago in in the heart of Silicon Valley I started a tech company without having an email address or a computer so if I can do it anyone can so again the reason that I'm here today is really to share some of the lessons that I learned in in the hopes that you don't make all the same mistakes that I do or that I did so these are really three powerful lessons that I learned uh unfortunately the hard way the first one was really the power of doing more with less because we didn't have a lot of money in the bank and we had to focus the second thing is making the system the hero from the very beginning and the third is to let Data Drive decisions so I'll dig into these things a little bit more throughout my talk I also wanted to give everyone here an opportunity to just listen and learn so I actually wrote an article on exactly what I'm talking about today including all the fine details of it and it's available at upshiftpartners.com dispatch so you'll be able to access the entire article so I encourage you to just you know put pens and computers down and just sit back and and relax so doing more with less hmm we started our companies just simply with our credit cards to be able to get our company launched so we didn't have a whole lot of cash in the bank and fortunately we were able to get it off the ground and we were able to get it up to about three million dollars in annual sales and then we just hit this plateau where it was like no matter how much Brute Force we were using the the top line numbers just weren't growing and I can remember this one day sitting down and and you know we were pretty ambitious we wanted to double the revenue of the company every single year and I can remember sitting down actually looking at the numbers and thinking oh like I'm gonna have to hire three times as many sales people in the next like four months to get this growth and although I was willing to do that like I'm I'm a hustler at heart I knew that God I just don't want that to be the first option I knew that in my gut like there had to be a better way than just simply Brute Force and so the next morning I came into the office and I printed off our entire customer list at this point we actually had computers so it was it was amazing so printed off the customer list and sat down with it and actually started looking through all the customers and and how much they were spending on uh with our platform and I something caught my eye I found that there was these two customers that were spending about 10 times the amount of Revenue in the same period of time as our average customer and it got my attention kind of the light bulb started to go off and I started to ask around and ask the different team members you know why are these people spending so much more than everyone else and honestly nobody had a really good answer for me so I went on Elance and I hired an internet researcher to basically take our top 10 customers and our bottom 10 customers and look at like all the other attributes that we didn't currently have so you know we had name and address and that kind of basic information but what we didn't have was things like how many counties did these business cover how long at their website uh been up or when did it when was it most recently updated what were they doing as far as online advertising what were they doing on social and we got the results back a few days later and I can say that 98 of it didn't tell us anything but it was that two percent that was actually really valuable we saw these similarities between the customers that were these kind of 10x customers and also similarities in the like the bottom uh 10 customers and and I started to look at it and say wow like in order to double the company I only need to get 20 of these customers as opposed to 200 other customers and and I always describe myself as being productively lazy so I look for the fastest way that also requires the least amount of effort in order to kind of achieve the goals so I started looking at it and said okay I went back onto Elance hired another researcher and said I want you to find a hundred people that match this exact same criteria that are that these two 10x companies match a few days later we get this list back we did is we said okay we're going to go after this really small list of super high value customers the first thing we need to do is get their attention they don't even know about us so what we did was we designed this really clever campaign where basically and this is I think what where my my hustle side came in is basically said we're going to hit these companies from every single side for 12 weeks straight and we're going to get all of their attention so what we did is we sent out a little direct mail piece with kind of a clever gift and a clever handwritten note that got their attention we sent that out every single week and then we would call behind the direct mail campaign so we sent out the first one waited for the phones to ring nothing happened sent out the second one waited for the phones to ring nothing happened four weeks go by and my co-founder and uh and our sales people are like yeah that was just another one of Gabe's crazy ideas that didn't really work and it's a Wednesday afternoon and and my cell phone rings and I pick it up and guy says yeah is this game yes he says this is Steve you've got my attention what can you do for me I was so caught off guard that I had to tell me I was in the middle of a meeting and call him back and I looked up his information this is the CEO of a four billion dollar company that has just called me on my cell phone so end up setting a meeting with Steve week five get another phone call two weeks later get two more phone calls play it out four months later we'd signed over two million dollars in new business and when we tallied up what we spent in marketing it was less than two thousand dollars the most amazing marketing return you could ever imagine and what I learned in doing that was was a couple big things first off and this is more for people that that don't yet have customers is focus on customers that kind of meet three criteria they have the most pervasive urgent and costly need the second thing is if you're already running and you already have a customer base look at the top 10 and the bottom ten and actually spend the time dig into all the attributes and try to understand what makes those people the top ten or the bottom tent don't just kind of use the spray and pray approach and then in the words of Notorious Big Mo Money Mo Problems the reality is you know if we had 10 million dollars in the bank I wouldn't have been forced to be that creative so money buys a lot of things it doesn't necessarily buy creativity and it doesn't certainly doesn't buy Hustle so lesson two uh is really about making the system the hero when I was in college my I would say my first job after making deli sandwiches where I actually got fired from that's when I decided that um I should be a CEO um my my kind of first Real World experience I got an internship where I got to start and run my own house painting company I know you're all thinking wow what a sexy job but over the course of a summer what I did was actually go literally go around and knock on doors and get leads of people who want to get painting work done and then do estimates and and um you know and end up booking work and running a house painting company what I learned in doing that was two really core things one was the power of hustle like knocking on ten thousand doors before I ever turned 21 getting chased by dogs and whatnot and the second thing was really the power of a good system and so I took that into the next company that we started so we started my last company Cal finder um literally without email addresses or computers but we knew the power of a system so we wanted to test the concept and what we did was we took four yellow notepads four pens and we wrote down a really simple script um that we were going to test on homeowners to see if they would want to get connected with Home Service professionals and we took those basic scripts out and we took our yellow notepads we went and knocked on doors because that's what we knew how to do we didn't know how to build software or anything and the first day we get back and and we'd collected about 10 names and phone numbers people that wanted work done it's pretty surprising the next day we followed a similar process so what we did was we looked in the Yellow Pages and tried to find contractors that had the biggest ads because we knew they were spending money and we wrote down a script and a kind of a pitch that we would use then we went to their offices and we pitched them on the concept and said Hey listen would you be interested in getting homeowners that want to get work done on their houses they said yes we said well how much would you pay classic Hustler move and they said 80 bucks so we asked them if they had a photocopy machine and we took these yellow notepads and we went into their office and we made a copy and we got them to write us a check for 800 bucks to buy the 10 names and that was like our seed capital and then we went to the next contractor's office and we followed the same script and asked them how much they'd be willing to pay they said 100 bucks so we did the same thing made another thousand bucks third contractor we asked the same questions says 120 bucks make 1200 more bucks so maybe three thousand bucks in our first day we're like fist pumping and thinking we're going to be billionaires by the end of the month um but what we what we were able to do is we took those same scripts and the next week we went to college campus and we said ask college kids if they wanted to make 30 bucks an hour took them out the next week got 40 leads using that same script followed the same process with contractors and we just rinsed and repeated we made the system better every single week and that's what enabled us to go from me being the first salesperson to 10 sales people to 25 to 50 without ever raising any outside funding so my advice is make the system the hero from the very beginning you know when you look at companies like Uber or Lyft they're expanding into all these new markets and they have a playbook for everything and so it's never too early to start building your playbook the second thing is if you're doing something more than twice it needs to be documented there needs to be a checklist otherwise you're always going to do that task or somebody else is going to do a shitty job of it the third thing is set a schedule to iterate especially if you're early in the game there's probably some really simple things that you're doing every week whether it be having conversations with customers or trying to get your first sales like start then build a Playbook and then iterate on it every single week so lesson three and I would say this was one of the most painful lessons that I learned and and I've had to learn it a couple of times but but I want to share a story with you that was a pivotal moment in my last company so we've taken the company and we were at the time we were going after kind of a small business segment so it was a very much like a high volume approach and we had built a sales organization to 50 sales people which is a incredibly challenging thing to do and it's also kind of like hurting cats imagine 50 sales people in one room it's it's kind of a nightmare so we built a company to 50 sales people we had 4X the number of deals that we were doing even a short period before um and we had had about six months in doing that and and started to look at the numbers and it was like I remember this like rock dropping into my belly and and realizing that we had made like a massive mistake and only six of those sales people were actually performing when we looked at all the numbers um what had happened is that we hired all these people very excited signing lots of deals but all the customers were churning out and we had really like bad customer satisfaction ratings so we looked at these six and these six sales people were just they were killing it they were doing incredibly well and we looked at the bank account and again we didn't have a whole lot of buffer and if we looked at the numbers and we said if we continue on this path we'll be bankrupt in 45 to 60 days and I like it still hurts when I think about it but we had to make a massive course correction this is one of the most difficult things I've ever done in business we let go of 42 people the next week these are people that had given like their lives to helping grow the company and it was just heartbreaking and what we did is we went back to the drawing board and we looked at all the data from all the six from the six people that were being really successful and what we found is that they were going after a different kind of customer type and they had a a like a certain kind of timing that they were using to get in touch with them and so what we did was again going back to lesson two we started to build a recipe around what these six people were doing play that forward and we had actually doubled the revenue of the company without hiring another sales person over the next 12 months so one of the most difficult decisions that I ever made but if I let my ego get in the way of of actually making an objective decision based on data I wouldn't be up here on this stage today talking to you about our success so what did I learn from this I learned to always let Data Drive decisions this is something that's just absolutely critical for startups there's so many moving parts and so many challenges that you have to let Data Drive decisions and if the highest paid person in the room is is purely relying on gut you're going to get yourself into trouble pretty quickly and you might end up down a road that's really hard to correct from the second thing is doing the best to remove ego from decision making so our question always is you know what does the data say not what do you think what's your opinion on it what does the data say and then the third thing is to manage by the numbers and this is oftentimes a transition for startups from the early craziness where you're just like throwing spaghetti against the wall seeing what sticks and transitioning out of that and actually building a sustainable company and having that kind of transparency to run the company by the numbers so you know this this last lesson I don't need to harp on it but it was one that was kind of a culmination for me and it's an area in in going through that process and having to actually let go of all those people and also to rebuild the company what I learned was obviously that the power of focus and doing more with less I also learned to to let the system be the hero and build the system around what's working and then also to let Data Drive decisions so now I I um I wanted to take a little bit of time to answer some questions either on my own path of you know scaling my last company or you know what we've learned in helping seven startups to scale sales over the last seven months so happy to answer questions yeah questions uh hey Gabe thanks for taking the time to do this today um I helped Sam a little bit with hustle combat um during the day I'm a sales development rep at zenefits so I thought what you said was really interesting can you talk more about those six people that were sort of the outliers with um in your organization what they did differently than the other 42 that you cut off yeah so the things that we started to notice was they they were going after actually a different customer segment and they were taking more of a I would call like a sniper approach as opposed to like the AK-47 approach so these people if if our average salesperson they were calling on smbs right so it was a big volume game and the height of things we were doing about 20 000 outbound calls a day and these sales people were doing like five calls a day each but yet the people that they were talking to were highly qualified and also had the potential to spend a lot more on the platform and they also set great expectations so we didn't have churn uh with those people so that's those are the kind of the attributes that we found with those sales people so were they doing mostly email Outreach or like how are they getting they were doing email and then following up with a phone call um and so that was like the approach that seemed to be working for them cool thank you cool any other questions please come down oh okay nope okay all right thanks very much Gabe sure

our next speaker is heat and shot and if you know anything about this guy you've probably seen his face everywhere i don't know how he sleeps or if he does sleep but he's pretty much everywhere he's a mentor at 500 startups he's an active blogger and is the founder of crazy egg and kissmetrics along with neil patel kissmetrics has raised about 13 million dollars in funding funding and heaton leads a team of 50 50 members he's going to talk about how he's been able to be so productive so let's give a warm welcome to heaton shaw i'm just going to get started because i have a shitload of slides and i got to get through all of them so i'm going to talk really fast you might not understand what i'm saying just kidding so uh when we when uh sam uh asked me to speak uh we actually did a little experiment we did a blog post and uh he asked all of you and a bunch of other people to ask me what i should speak on and what happened was a lot of people had a lot of different things to ask me about that were very specific very tactical and what ended up happening is that i decided to talk about whatever i wanted to but it was actually based on a question from sam and the question was why are you more productive than most people and this is like at the end of his email after like these five or six other sort of topics and what i really realized is that most people that are on stage today are going to tell you tactics about how they did something or how you can do something etc and i'm actually going to talk about something completely different one i don't know why people think i'm productive i'm actually the laziest per entrepreneur you'll ever meet i walk around my office saying that i don't do any work and hopefully this talk will help you understand why i do that uh or not so i've had a computer since 1989. does anyone recognize this circuit board looking thing some of you okay great so this is going to date me so all of you are old too um and so basically uh this is a sound card that used to go in computers when they were big metal heavy boxes um and i've been playing with them since i was eight years old the last language i learned though was q basic so i don't know if any of you are familiar with that any of you familiar with qbasic cool awesome i don't know how to write code but with qbasic i used to terrorize radio shack employees so i would go create a little loop and like run it and then they wouldn't know what to do because they didn't know how to use control c and get out of it and it was all ms-dos at the time so uh yeah that that's about as far as i get when it comes to uh programming that being said like i said can't design can't write code but um i work with awesome developers and designers and uh some of the things i'm going to talk about are how how i was able to do that uh but also i make them feel like this sometimes they're all super heroes but like when i talk sometimes they get kind of frustrated and give me that look i've seen that look a lot and the reason is i can always out google them so that's my superpower if anyone needs to know i can out google you bring it they can tell me like two or three things about some variable or parameter or whatever and usually i can google it for them so to prepare this talk i really wanted to think about hustle and think about what the word meant because i think there's a it's an interesting word and uh i got links at the bottom my slides are on slideshare i'll tweet them out right after this i forgot to before this because of sam but anyways uh if you go look on urban dictionary there's a bunch of stuff in the middle of these two things that says things about selling drugs and other things like that but this is basically what hustle means it's uh basically anything you need to make money if you're making money you hustling that's apparently what this is about and this is like a way different talk than anything i've ever done before i'm going to share all kinds of stuff that i haven't shared before and i'm going to get right into it so i've been doing business on the web for 11 years i don't know how to code so apparently i'm a hustler i do know how to make money i'd say lots of it but i'm not yeah lots of it and the one thing i know from kissmetrics these are actually our kissmetrics values and we only have five of them we like to keep it simple kissmetrics the kiss part stands for keep it simple stupid um somebody actually walked up to me and i know we're at a non-tech conference because someone walked up to me earlier today i know you're in the room right now and they said they really like my logo and this logo that i'm wearing which is the kissmetrics logo and usually uh when that happens they usually know what the logo is but i was stumped because he didn't know what the logo was he didn't even know what kissmetrics was so that's awesome i actually feel really good about that because there's a lot more people that need to know about the businesses that i run and i've been theming my talks based on value at kissmetrics so i'm going to talk about the value that we used for this that i'm using for this talk so the value is take care of people and the reason i want to talk about that today and a lot of the talks gonna be around those kind of things is because when you when you think of the word hustle you think of money you don't actually think about people and uh the biggest person that matters in anyone's lives whether you want to believe it or not is probably yourself and uh the the way that i'm so productive is i basically invest in myself so now you're gonna hear a whole bunch of tactics a whole bunch of things about sort of how i invest myself and how all of you can too again a lot different a lot more of a different talk think of it as like self-help for hustlers if you want to put it that way and there's three parts to it learning communication and context and you'll learn about all these three and hopefully have tactics that you can take home with you so that you can sort of try to be like me if anyone ever wanted to learning so uh also one thing i'll mention is a lot of these tactics a lot of these things are things that a lot of friends of mine have heard me talk about but there are also things that i don't see anybody talking about it's not something i have read in a blog post about uh in terms of holistically how to do this stuff so for for me learning i think that's the only thing that matters personally uh and especially when you can't write code because you can't actually write code make something launch it to customers but you can definitely learn as fast as you can and i do really believe at this time there's more information out there than any any any other sort of time in history and so learning is really what you should be optimizing for there's actually a book on the topic this guy josh kaufman wrote a book it's called the first 20 hours how to learn anything fast obviously you can guess why that resonated with me considering this topic so i did want to share the book he actually talks about how you can learn ruby in less than 20 hours as well so in case any of you want to learn programming which you should even though i haven't yet although i keep threatening that i will i just turned 33 yesterday and i'm threatening that by 40 i'll learn how to program uh and and i threaten this to my engineers because i'm sure it's something that they they're really looking forward to all my questions one tactic uh tim ferriss wrote this blog post about how to read 300 faster in 20 minutes it's really useful if you're into reading you can take this tactic i personally actually don't use the tactics in here in this blog post uh the reason is i don't actually uh read text but i'll talk about that in a second another thing is a site called get abstract it's basically summarizes books for you and it's really amazing very thorough summaries you have to pay for it though and there's also an audio component to it youtube anybody know about this trick you can actually listen to youtube videos at 2x speed people sound like chipmunks it's pretty awesome but and here's the trick you have to get through like the first 20 30 seconds and then you actually start understanding what people are saying audible this is actually my my favorite trick and and this is the exact reason so i listen to audible at 3x speed there isn't a single book i've read in the last i don't know 18 months that i haven't read at 3 xp actually listened to at 3x speed again people sound like chipmunks for the first 30 seconds after that i believe and i don't know any science around this i haven't really researched it i just really enjoy listening to people like chipmunks or speak like chipmunks but basically i believe you start understanding what they're saying now there's one book that i i haven't read yet because i couldn't really do it uh it's basically a book called the goal i think uh it's one of jeff bezos's favorite book uh books and it's narrated by a french gentleman and i had a very hard time doing 3x and i actually had to go all the way down to 1.52x so you know every rule is meant to be broken every everything i say is so you know whatever this is my favorite thing that i've read in the last 18 months months i've read it about three or four times and i say red but i heard it at 3x speed it's a book called the five elements of effective thinking and the reason i really like this is it helps me think and i think learning is all about sort of getting inputs so you can think and for me i want to get that those inputs as fast as i can also it helps me understand fast talkers better too so uh on to communication and really i i was working on these slides and i was actually i had a buddy with me i was working on him on a big 70-inch screen because i don't know it's kind of fun that way and we were looking at this slide and he's like well can you and i'm like well what do you mean can i of course i can talk about this he's like no no can you i said oh can you communicate got it yeah i think most of us think we can but we always can get better at it right so one of the big things i learned is it's very important to communicate and it's very important to figure out how you can do it and when you're communicating you're obviously communicating with somebody else so uh one of the things that i really thought about was um personalities and i used to really be allergic how many of you are into personality tests or have ever ever taken one even okay so everyone's kind of taken one and all that how many of you think are allergic to them okay not enough all right that's great uh i guess i'm special uh but anyways i put this picture of food because most people are allergic to food and stuff uh my kids alert they're allergic to a lot of things so i thought it was pretty cool and also the pie chart most of the uh personality tests have some form of a pie chart and those always freak me out because then that's something else you have to understand and understand how to like understand but i had kids and my first kid was actually when i was 15 is my co-founder neil he's actually my brother-in-law and he was 11 at the time that's his site and him on the left i'm sure some of you have heard of him because he's also apparently a hustler and that's him taking care of my two kids so technically i had him who i had to communicate with because he's my co-founder but i've known him a very long time married to his sister actually and then i had kids who are both quite different even though one of them is a baby she still has she's already starting to get a personality and so after i kind of figured this out i started researching because you know that's what you do on the web you start googling i guess and i found this blog post on hbr uh or hbs or whatever that site and uh they talk about the top sources of work conflict and number one is personal insecurity so someone just being insecure a new job or just you know generally being insecure about things uh the desire for power and control this is why i don't work at a big company uh i call that politics and then uh habitual victimhood but once i started really dig into this i realized that it's actually just people's personalities and how other people make them feel and so on that note i'm going to talk about a scenario that i basically discovered by understanding uh personalities better uh and and it's a very very just a scenario that i had happen recently so uh the summary based on our personalities is uh and i work with this person so she's driven by winning uh i'm more driven by having a deep understanding and this is basically how it manifests so i'd ask her what do you need from me it's a very common question a lot of managers and leaders or whatever will ask i do it quite a bit especially if i don't know what the answer is but that's also a sign in itself for me and she tells me she needs something and then i ask her why what i learned is it drives her nuts and i really didn't i don't personally on a personal level intuitively understand why it drives her nuts to be honest but it drives her nuts and it has a lot to do with her personality and mine and she basically finds those types of conversations derailment and a waste of energy and i wouldn't have really understood why or any of that stuff unless i really understood our personalities and the difference between them and the way i did that is uh there's this uh system up here uh again you'll see some pie charts soon don't worry but it's called in color insights and it the this is all about your sort of behavioral orientations and it's a way to kind of uh in my opinion explain yourself to yourself and it's got four things action action people structure and ideas this is actually my personal insight inventory uh there's basically three sections to it behavior is basically um the the the way you feel more most confident and for me there's a lot of yellow yellow is people there's also a bunch of blue blue as ideas and uh when you kind of see the next slide you'll understand kind of me a little bit better so i'm just gonna get to that so i'm gonna read these out because this this is basically me and it kind of blew my mind in a way because it's pretty accurate but i like to consult with informed others i explore ideas with valued colleagues and develop extensive personal knowledge hence this talk believe people should be receptive to new ideas and probe for information and then i assess the value of any activity or action based on the insight and feelings of self-worth it creates and its positive impact on other people so if i feel like i wasn't valuable in a conversation or a meeting or something it actually freaks me out right after and then i start running it in my head and try to figure out how i could do better it's just something natural i do i don't even know why i do it and it actually really bugs me and then i sometimes will go ask the people hey was that okay and they're like yeah it was great we learned a lot blah blah blah i'm like all right cool so this positive impact on other people is something that uh sounds all hokey and weird but it's part of my personality so i don't know what to do with it another quick trick in case none of that mattered to you about communication i wrote a blog post about learning uh writing better emails so just like all of you i'm sure you know actually i get angry and i don't typically know what to do so i basically now just draft an email to the person and and i send it i'm kidding i draft the email and i save it i don't include anything in the to field and i and i sleep on it or whatever and then i read it again and usually that means i either don't send it save it for later because i'm still angry or or write a much better email so that's just a quick tactic for all of you uh again in case you're still allergic to personality tests and stuff that is that one i showed before is my favorite one though um and uh this this this example is basically just a customer support example so at crazy ag which launched in 2005 it's one of my companies uh i basically took care of support customer support for the first two years and myself amongst all the other things i was doing and that was back when i actually used to do stuff and uh this is what basically happened i ended up being a line item when people were trying to make a decision between us and other competitors so just just another trick just help people you know share share what you know and uh really care about customers but you've already heard a lot of that already today so uh this is the last section i have a little bit of a sort of long-winded thing at the end it's not really long-winded it's just uh something that i like talking about and it's it's not very much talked about so i'm going to get into that in a second but context is basically the idea of you know a lot of times you'll hear people say something and then you'll have to correct them because they don't actually understand the context so they might go tell you hey you should go buy a luxury luxury car or something but really you might not have the money for it and this is a very crude example but so you should buy like a like a honda or a kia or something instead but if someone tells you to buy a luxury car they're not really understanding your context if that's not affordable for you so that's just a simple way to explain context in my mind i also wrote about this a little bit it's about how i give advice one of the most common ways that people uh like to ask questions is they'll ask me about my own experience so they might ask me about you know when you started kissmetrics what did you do about sales how did you start your blog you know when you raise money what you know how'd you raise money and uh i go i go into this deeper in the blog post but overall i try to reframe the question because every question that most entrepreneurs and most people are asking about me is excuse me really a question about them and that's something i've learned so i just try to reframe it that way i can get context because otherwise i'm just telling my story over and over and over again and honestly that's boring for me but it's also not value very valuable for other people plus like i've spoken a lot and i've written about stuff a lot and if you want to know my story go read it online or watch a video instead let me figure out how to help you so this is why i really focus on this sort of approach uh as i was researching about questions and contacts i ran into this book i like books but i like listening to him as all of you know i'm about 90 done and i liked it it also includes uh talks about lean startup and eric reese a little bit in it so it's kind of cool and kind of a newer book and it's called a more beautiful question and it actually talks about questions how to ask them um and even how to get a better understanding because of questions and stuff like that so this is the last part it looks like i only have a minute but i might stretch it a little bit um i hope that's okay although you guys have a break and juice or something like that so i'm sure i'm sure you're dying to get there and tired of me talking but uh the this graphic the reason i put it up there is uh a lot of times i'll get into like philosophical sort of discussions with entrepreneurs and stuff and and many times it leads to discussion about this right here this is basically the idea that everyone's against you um has anyone ever felt like that don't lie well i'll admit i have so um uh you know and i don't like feeling like that and uh a lot of times it has to do for me personally it has to do with like competition or other companies and things like that and so i just wanted to get a better understanding of founders entrepreneurs or even people hustling in general and sort of the different sort of mindsets so came up with a little formula my buddy joe stump and i did a podcast on this um anyways that's a kind of funny picture of him but he was looking at the legos and these are these are the two legos it's basically uh pirates and explorers that's the concept uh explorers tend to be revolutionary so these are the kind of people who uh always always think uh that whatever they're doing is innovative revolutionary even if it maybe isn't so that's why i use this cartoon for that and pirates are the ones that are usually looking at something and trying to figure out how to get it even if someone else has it so then exact classic example is if a pirate typically goes after explorers to go steal their loot uh and that's typically what i've seen so this example is more like something i commonly hear so what i commonly hear is that um i've i just heard this yesterday uh some new product launched and uh uh somebody who has a competing product already in the market was like oh yeah they've been trying to use our product for like three months now and i've been talking to them uh thinking it's a sales pitch for this other thing they're doing but then they end up launching basically a competitor to our business so that's more of a pirate mentality and you know right or wrong it doesn't matter this is what people do and so here's the difference and and my my big question for all of you if you don't leave with anything else or any of these crazy tactics or start doing them is where are you on the spectrum so an explorer is discovery centric so searching for new land new ideas new things they tend to be first movers in markets or very early movers and they tend to focus on the problem to solve like the right problem to solve for the customer pirates on the other hand are very market-centric they think about all the different competitors all the different solutions out there sometimes you'll see you know a grid of the features between all these customers or all these all these businesses and things like that that's a very market-centric approach they tend to be fast followers so if you have if you're running a pirate ship you typically have a ton of like engineers for example that can build something really fast faster than anybody else and then they generally build solutions and that's what i mean by faster than anyone else their world view tends to be more skewed on we can build it faster we can build it better um and their definition of better is just like more of a feature list or a checklist and you know in my experience people fall pretty pretty much one way or another on the spectrum but the reason i'm saying this and and i brought it up in relation to competition and even like context so you have to understand yourself and and understand where you are on the spectrum and whether you need to move in a certain direction or not me personally i tend to be more of an explorer uh there's things i appreciate about pirates uh and and i've been trying to sort of figure out how to think more uh like a pirate sometimes so i have built that sort of checklist and stuff like that just to explore kind of how i can think and how i can be this is one of the quotes if you've ever emailed me it's a quote at the bottom of my email i'm not going to change it it's really the words i live by i really do believe personally especially based on my personality type that i will get everything i want in life if i help enough other people get what they want so with that how can i help you come on down you got some time for questions maybe three or four cool okay you're the boss go ahead actually that i thought that was great and in a couple of minutes they're going to be mobbed by people so i just wanted to introduce myself and say hi how's it going all right nice to meet you how you doing i hope i speak to you soon sounds good that was great all right anybody got a question i like him but still anybody got a question that was bold nice okay my email's right there dude and i answer email um i actually have a question all right so i liked that pirates and explorers and do you feel like when you're getting a group together you should have some of both on the ship or that the ship should be the culture of a pirate or the ship should be the culture of an explorer i really believe that companies are a reflection of the founder or the founders depending on that and you need to understand what you are so my advice on that would be if you know that the founders one is one and one is the other or skews one way or another it's probably uh easier to have a ship full of both types of people but generally in most cases from what i've seen the company is one way or another and it takes a lot to change the culture of a company it has everything to do with the culture hi symmetric genie of catalyst and my question is how much do you think of personality should you cater to your strengths or be uh you know working on those weaknesses when it comes to uh hustling versus you know trying to be true to yourself or whatever i i think you need to understand yourself and and if you start looking at a lot of the personality things um you start thinking a lot about nature versus nurture and i think uh it's probably much harder to change sort of something that's nature especially if you have an understanding of that so i i'd more i'd more do to be self-helpy i'd probably do a self-assessment first and then figure out areas where you actually truly believe you should and can change there's a lot of things about yourself that you can't change for me it's more it's not about changing necessarily it's more about understanding other people and understanding how you can get along with them for example that that person i describe our relationship with they're no longer with my company and it just wasn't going to work out and i was managing them that's why i'm sure if someone else was managing them at our company it would have been different but it's just better to understand that faster that's that's the value of it okay thanks hey i'm corey big fan you pop up in everything that i see there's so many people that are quoting you and getting interviewed why not so it's cool i hadn't heard that you do the three times audible thing but i'm curious are you are you taking notes while you're listening to this or are you like doing a different activity because i listen to podcasts a lot but afterwards i always have to go back and like really listen to them and take notes because just listening to it it doesn't get internalized yeah um the part i didn't include in there is i think it heavily is heavily dependent on how you learn and so for me i'm a audio person so audio so actually it's even more interesting for me i think there's a type of person i don't know what it's called but if if i have audio and then i'm ambiently around like in a space like uh walking around i walk around a lot when i talk i remember the conversation much better so for me if i can link those two together i remember if i just see something visually it's actually harder for me it's more of the spatial and the audio and i would just study up on like how people learn and see how you actually learn that's why i mentioned the other things like reading and stuff because some people need to see the words and that's how they digest it some people need to take notes in my case i typically don't take as many notes when it's that fast i might listen to it multiple times but usually i'm listening to it multiple times because i think it's really good and i need it over and over again to understand the concepts but the taking the notes part i never go back to them yeah that's just you that wouldn't work well for everybody yeah exactly yeah just learn how you learn cool thanks yes i think uh two questions one is uh since you said you don't really have a true coding background um when you selected your first engineer to work with you like how did you determine that they had the qualities and skills to for your idea to execute it yeah great question um these i think these days it's a lot different than before uh for for me uh the engineer that's been with us the longest uh he's actually a partner at crazy ag i found because i hustled and back in 06 ish when when when the people that originally built crazy egg had couldn't do anymore uh they were just running to problems that i could google and fix uh if i knew how to code um but uh i went through the ruby on rails.org because that's when ruby on rails was kind of popular and i emailed literally everyone on the list uh that was an engineer and i spoke to i would say 20 to 30 percent of them i've made a lot of friends that way like uh the folks that started gowalla back in the day scott raymond i i bothered him at the time and i literally just tried to find someone who i thought was competent

so our next speaker is a Joel guess cone he's the CEO and Founder a buffer which is I'm sure you guys have all seen this if you have twitter or facebook it's where you see the b.f.f ly on your feed but right now they have 26 employees they do about 3.5 million dollars in revenue and joel's talk is going to cover how he was able to start buffer and the most getaway possible so please welcome Joel hi everyone it's great to be here excited to chat with your so yeah at some mention my name is Joel gas going I'm the co-founder and CEO of a company called buffer and today I want to chat with you about some of the tactics and lessons that we've learned in the last few years that have helped us to to grow buffer and so hopefully this will be useful for you if you're thinking about doing a start-up or if you're working at a start-up right now as a little bit about me I'm originally from the UK and started buffer in the UK about about four years ago almost now so the end of 2010 and yeah I'm probably an unusual choice of speaker for this conference because I've actually been coding since i was about 12 years old so but at the same time i'm really excited to speak with you and because of that because i found that often coding was kind of like a crutch for me and it was kind of the first thing i would reach for whenever had ideas and over time I discovered that that's been a kind of a really big mistake that I made and it's something that I've had to adjust so I've got a few different stories i want to share with you of times where we've kind of jump too quickly to coding and it's kind of not worked out and then i've got a few other stories where we've had a lot of success without coding at all our vision for the product is to be the simplest and most powerful social media tool and the problem we help to solve is with posting to Facebook and Twitter and scheduling posts so um the idea is we give you a cue and you can add content to that Q and then we'll then space that content for you over the course of the day so you could read the news in the morning and will then share that for you throughout the whole day before I dive in I also wanted to just mention three kind of interesting things about the company and that make us a little bit different than other startups the first one is that we have a fully distributed team we're 26 people right now spread all across the world we're in 20 cities in five different continents the second one is that we've raised 450 k seed round of funding but we've hit profitability based on that and so we've not waste any more funding after that and right now we don't have any plans to raise more funding the third one is that we have a core value of transparency within the company and so we try and do things in a very open way and this is exciting because I think by sharing our failures and successes we can really help a lot of people and do things like this so one of the most controversial things that we've been transparent about that you might have come across is we we are completely transparent about salaries and equity within the company so we have a formula to determine the salary of everyone in the company and we make that formula public but not only that but we have a list of everyone in the company and their salary and that's public too so this is all available just at a Google spreadsheet and if you want to check it out you can go to buff lee / open pay cool and so before buffer I worked on a previous start up for about a year and a half and ultimately it was failure but I learned a lot of lessons along the way that contributed to how I thought about starting off buffer I think the two big mistakes i wanted to mention the first one is that I just built whatever came to my mind and and without validating it and the second one was that I didn't make enough effort to talk with people about what I was building and I think overall the big mistake was that I just enjoyed the coding too much and didn't and I kind of forgot about building a business during that time I discovered the Lean Startup concepts and our grease and I think that really changed my mindset in love ways changed how I thought about approaching ideas and in a way that kind of changed my life because it then changed a lot of things about how I built things so kind of based on the Lean Startup techniques that I came across i decided with buffer i wanted to take a different path and so the funny thing is that as soon as i had the idea for buffer I the first thing I did was just to think about coding just jump in and and then I kind of had to just stop myself and say you know what should I how should I approach this in a lean way and how can i validate this without going ahead and building the whole product and so I think that's probably one of the big lessons that I've learned after a few different failures is that um I think if I look back now it's clear that I was building things as a hobby really and I think that's what happens when you just go and build whatever comes to mind and that can be fun but i think you know if you really want to build a business you need to validate your ideas either that you've just got to get really lucky so thinking about how to approach things in a lean way and I thought how can i validate the idea of buffer before I even built a product and so this is what I came up with and it's a simple three page website and other time I built this myself but there's lots of tools out there right now that are much better equipped to building like this than diving into code so something like bond bounce would be absolutely perfect for building this and yeah so I kind of just to walk through this the most important thing to notice about this free page website is that the first page made it look like the product already existed and I think that was really important if you wanted to get a ton of signups it might not be the best thing to do but if you want to truly validate whether you people want your idea and I think it's kind of crucial so the first page was just like a landing page it had a headline and then three steps and then it had a plans and pricing button and then they would click the place the plans and pricing button and go to the next page which was just a pricing page and then from there they would choose one of the plans and then they would end up on the final page and the final page and just says hello you've called us too soon we're not quite ready yet and then it would give them a chance to put the email inbox and give me their email and be notified when the products actually existed so I drove a bit of traffic to this free page website and luckily some people went all the way through and gave me their email at the end so that was pretty great and as you already know I was kind of obsessed with the Lean Startup so I was pretty excited about looking at the analytics and checking the funnel and looking all the numbers and things and that was another big lesson that I learned is that in the early days the numbers are just not that useful you just don't have the volume really am but instead what was useful and what I did was that every person that gave me the email i personally emailed them and got into it and then i had a conversation with them so i had a lot of conversations over email and had a few skype calls as well and what I found was that once people understood understood the concept and quite a few of them said that they would want to use this product and a few even said that they would pay for it if it existed and at the same time quite a few people told me that I was crazy and the no one would ever use this and no one will pay for it and but I was pretty happy that I actually had some validation from a few people that said that they would want to use it so that gave me kind of enough confidence to go ahead and think about building the first kind of minimal version of the actual product cool so I'd kind of decided to build the first version of the product and that was when I reflected on the Lean Startup concepts again and something that Eric we said really kind of stood out in my mind one of his conferences one of his presentations someone asked this in the Q&A session they said how many more should your Minimum Viable Product be your first version of you product and Eric we said that there's probably not there's not like a perfect answer but the answer is almost always that it should probably be much more minimal than you think and so I really tried to keep this in mind when I approached building the first version of buffer so the first thing that I approached in kind of a minimal way was the actual feature set itself so the first version of buffer and you could only use it for Twitter so there was no other networks you could use it for not only that we could only use it for one Twitter account and there was no analytics either so really was purely just this idea of the queue for one Twitter account and that was it um and I think that's kind of an important point is that when you're doing your first version I think it's useful to be kind of laser focused with what you put out there and so I think it helps you then when you put it out there that it's going to be a very clear signal one way or the other hi there works or it doesn't whereas if you have a bunch of features it's going to be much more cloudy and you're not going to know what folks on what to improve and a couple of other things that we left out in this first version the first was the actual or grade process of going from the free version to the paid version and so normally when you pay for a product that you expect that you would you put your card details in and you then you kind of get an email pub Lee and you get access to these paid features right away way and what happened with the first couple of months of buffer was that you would pay with paypal and then I would get an email into my personal inbox that said someone had paid with paypal and then I would rush to the database and upgrade them manually and then email them the welcome email personally and I apologize for the delay of our systems and and this kind of worked out really well because I mean maybe it wasn't an ideal experience for the user but what happened then was that I had a lot of conversations with users and then it actually became an even better experience for them another example was that on the paid version there was a paid feature of using your own custom bit ly details and that was another thing where the way I thought about it was it's on the paid version but it doesn't really have validation yet and it didn't make sense for me to build that out before had any paying customers why would have work on a paid feature when I could instead work on trying to get that first paying customer and in the first place so there was this feature to have your own custom bit ly details which would let you then see the cliq analytics in your in your bit ly dashboard but um so this didn't exist and then so the first couple of people that are graded it actually wasn't a problem because they purely upgraded to get more space in that buffer and but the third person that upgraded sent me an email and said doesn't seem like this is working and so I said okay I'll just I'll look into it and then I thought that's probably a good time for me to actually build this feature and so yeah and then it took me about a couple of hours and then I've applied back and said you know maybe you can try it now and I think it's I think it's fixed now and and so then he was really happy with it and again I got to have a conversation and learn more about what other things he would want as well and so the end result of the kind of landing page experiment and the minimal first version was pretty great and it was a seven-week process in total from having the idea to launching the first version and had we had the first paying customer after four days so it worked how well it was just a five dollar payment it took a while I was still working full time doing web development on the side so it took a while to be able to drop that and focus full-time but it was a whole new experience for me yeah so we we kind of start off well but and what happened then over the next like you or two is that we struggle to approach everything with that same kind of discipline and a few weeks ago we look to have heat and showers a advisor he's going to be speaking a little bit later and he said to us that he sees a strange thing with startups they'll do customer development once but then they'll fail to make it part of the product process and this is something that we found to be really true and that's something we struggle with a lot so I've got a couple more examples I want to share with you of one where we've failed and then another one where we kind of succeeded cool so here's the first one and this is our browser extension pop-up so we have browser extensions for chrome firefox and safari and almost forty percent of all the sharing that happens comes from a browser extension so it's been a huge part of our of our success and back in 2012 we started to notice an interesting thing going on with facebook at the time which was that pictures were becoming a lot more prevalent on social media and today they're really be part of Twitter as well so they kind of become a big deal back then we noticed it and so we tried it out in our own accounts and we saw a lot of engagement so we were excited to try and help our users with this as well and and get a lot of engagement by using pictures we also were quite inspired by things like Pinterest where they'll show you all the pictures on the page and let you pin pictures so we thought we could do something like that so we kind of decided that we wanted to enhance the browser extension and bring in this picture sharing kind of ability into it so we got to work and a couple of months later we came up with this so you can see there's like four tabs on the left hand side so we would let you choose between sharing a link a picture a video or just a status update and that's how it looks after sharing a picture and so we were pretty excited this we started using it ourselves and it was working really well for us we got a lot more engagement by using pictures and then we kind of we were so excited that we nearly rolled it out to the whole user base and then I think one of us in the team just said well maybe we should let a few users try this first and see what they think so we decided to do some user testing and my co-founder Leo just jumped on he actually jumped on seven skype calls with customers and we just enabled it for them and ask them to talk us through how how I felt and what they were and what they thought things meant and stuff like that the results were pretty shocking we discovered that six out of seven people were completely confused with the UI and and so we discovered that people thought that the picture here was like the link attachment that would come up in facebook for when you're showing a link and people just didn't get it at all and we discovered that our team was completely biased like we knew exactly how it worked because we knew the problem we were solving from the first place so we knew exactly what the you I meant and stuff so that was kind of a big shame and especially because we could have known this exact same learning just by doing user testing with mock-ups two months earlier the final story I want to share with you guys this afternoon is how buffer for business came about so buffer for business is a paid plans beyond the most popular ten dollars a month plan for buffer so we have fifty dollars a month hundred dollars month and two hundred fifty dollars a month let me have a few enterprise customers beyond that and it's only been available for just over six months but it's already become a pretty big success and it's at twenty-seven percent of our monthly revenue now and so yeah so the first thing for us to kind of decide with buffer business was what would the products even be and so we had a couple of different ideas in mind when we thought about before business we had either just purely extending what already existed so people could have more accounts more team members and share more content the other one was something we were really excited about was a brand-new product and the idea was to help companies to make use of all employees if they connect that an old Twitter and Facebook accounts and have them share the news from the company of the press releases or job listings and things like that so we thought this would be really great for marketing departments for companies so what we did was we spoke with quite a few different customers so my co-founder leo he did a lot of customer development and what we found was the thing that we were really excited about and just ended up not resonating at all with people when we spoke with them so I think the best the best thing we the most useful thing we heard was a head of marketing said I can't rely on my camera I on the team to do marketing like that's what we have to do and so this will be a nice to have but we will wouldn't pay for this alone and where was the extending buffer and having more functionality and that was something that like really resonated and people were super excited about so and we had a lot of people that were hitting the limits of the ten dollars a month account and so there was a lot of kind of pent up demand there so we knew which one we needed to minions build and so I just want to walk you through then the process we went through kind of after that so we try to think about how can we validate this further and kind of build this out in a really lean way and what we realized is that if we just go and stripe we can add more plans in there so we added just a bunch of plans for different price points and we then Leo would just talk with customers who were hitting those limits and asked them if they wanted to get on to buffer for business which all it was really was releasing those limits and quite a few people wanted that so then he would just move them onto the plan in stripe and then we would start charging them more so this was great and in a very short space of time we had our first ten thousand dollars in revenue and that was six percent of our revenue at the time so it was pretty huge right away we then thought how can we get more leads so what we decided to do was to set up a woo foo form and just asking for the email and phone number if they want to get more information about before business and so we advertise this in Twitter and on the blog and that helps us grow the revenue even more then we realized that we could we could drive more leads if we put just a little bit of doing a tiny bit of code and put something on the pricing page at the bottom and so just letting people go to that woohoo form the next thing we did was to we thought it might be good to better qualify the leads and that helped Leo a lot so we added a bunch more fields to the roof reform and yeah then finally um by that time it was kind of a month or two after we'd started and we'd learned a lot and the pricing points became kind of clear so we decided to do a pricing page but we still didn't do it ourselves and write any code or anything we just decided to use wufu so we had this woohoo page with the pricing plans and we couldn't connect it to our database so we had to like ask for the email again and stuff but it worked really well and it helps us to be able to test different prices and things like that so this was great and yeah so today buffer for business is one of the best things we've done in the last year and it's twenty-seven percent of our Avenue now and it's almost 100k a month in revenue that we're getting from buffer business so that's yeah that's all the stories i want to share with you guys one quick thing to refer back to the middle of the talk on how we're trying to make this a process now so we're we have Heaton mentioned towards these four steps and in the last few weeks we've been really trying to vigorously follow these steps and especially kind of making these steps required for every thing that we do is what's helping a lot especially the hypothesis part is where we actually need to talk with people so cool that's everything and thanks so much for listening and loved answer any questions you have I think we can take two questions hey there how are you hey Michael from lots of stops great talk if you wouldn't mind so you have your team is is all over the world right yeah so that's what I'm looking to do as I built my company and I'm curious if you might want to briefly talk about the pros and cons of having a team that's dispersed worldwide yeah absolutely that's a written question so I think there's some huge benefits that we've found we were we were hacked last year and it was pretty crazy was a tough situation but the fact that the team was fully distributed across the world been though we didn't have to do a crazy I know two or three days staying up all night just to resolve that and we can have the different people in the world jumping under different points so it's been really really great I think the one key thing I would say with a distributed team is I got some advice from a guy called David cancel he's done quite a few startups and he's the product chief product officer for hope spot by now and he said to me he's had a few startups and he's tried both ways he said what you want to do is have either everyone in a inner office or have everyone distributed and if you go half way it's going to be really tough because then you end up with like second-class citizens and I know communication happening in the office that other people don't know about so that's how we do things we have an office in San Francisco but we just have four or five people in there and we still use hipchat a lot and we kind of say that HipChat is our office so yeah that's probably I would say but yeah we can catch up afterwards if you have any more questions as well hey I think it's really cool you're into the Lean Startup I work for the publisher that actually publishes the lean series and we want to use buffer for business right now so we're very excited about that listen I'm interested in validation did you ever try to validate something I'm failed was there ever an idea that didn't validate that you considered and didn't go through with yeah i mean the so the browser extension was a key one that failed and another one was and I think that's play the best example there is one that we didn't validate and it went through and then we found out a few months later so we did a whole redesign of the buffer dashboard and we we didn't validate it at all and then when we didn't look at any numbers or anything we didn't a be test it nothing so then two months or three months after we launched it we started to get really focused on data and look at numbers and things we managed to trace back that we had a huge drop in activation and of new users so the new dashboard was converting a new users to active users much worse than before and that's something that we've actually been kind of catching up with ever since so oh sure thanks sure cool

foreign side is the founder of Rebel Coast Winery which is actually the world's first Winery to ever go through a tech incubator and the reason why I wanted him to come because he is the most unorthodox startup founder I've ever met he's a pretty wacky dude but he's been able to successfully have his personality bleed into his brand and uh that's what he's going to be talking about so uh please welcome chip Forsyth so my brother and I started making wine in college originally to meet girls and that did not work out at all so we ended up having a ton of wine to sell so we ended up selling it to all the kids in the dorms for the next three years we would steal grapes from people's Vineyards bootlegged under a bridge and um and then just sell it to anybody that had you know five ten bucks for a bottle of wine when I was had to graduate the idea to actually build a legit Winery came around we raised a seed round started building this company I brought on two of my friends to help me do this and it turned out to be one of the most painful lessons I ever learned because a year and a half later we're growing really rapidly and um so a year and a half later we're growing really rapidly and we're no longer friends we had what I like to call the great divorce I don't know if any of you guys have started or started a company it's tough tough times and I ended up selling the winery so then took some time off goofed around and decided to make another Winery to get back into the business so I raised this another seed round and started building a product that I did not love or care about at all and I was faking this product I was trying to do what everyone else in the space was doing about that time I got into Adam Draper's incubator and he took me aside and he was like hey man what's going on like you're struggling this is tough you're not building anything that you can actually get behind like build something you can live and build something you can love so we ended up scrapping everything that we were doing because I was faking it I was building a product that I was faking and everyone could see it it was so obvious and um so we scrapped what we were doing and started over and it ended up costing around thirty thousand dollars to get rid of this product that we had already started making and put out on the market and that's when Rebel Coast my new winery was born and it we decided to build something that we could be really passionate about and build a brand that was really really enjoyable so that was me up there and we ended up only making one wine and putting everything of our every part of our personality into it and the goal was to make something that would tell our story even if we weren't there um and we absolutely loved what we were doing and the good thing about when you love what you do you're more you've got more leeway and everything so as a prank I put my other two co-founders cell phone numbers on about 10 000 corks each and I didn't tell them about it and we bottled this wine and it worked out really well in our favor and it was something really fun we did the good thing is we're in a really Antiquated archaic industry so if you go against the grain in any way you get a lot of attention and we ended up building a cult following effortlessly overnight and it's really helped Drive everything that we're doing and the good thing about that is in any industry that anybody's in attention's huge and it didn't cost us a dollar to get this huge amount of attention that we got and it wasn't just for the wine we were making like that was a secondary thing everybody was excited about why why we were doing this um to this day we still get unsolicited a couple hundred resumes a month and it's from people who have never heard about or never even tasted our wine the majority of them they're like hey what you're doing looks really fun how do we get into it and if you're building a company getting people that are interested in working with you and helping build is awesome and this is a traditional sales team on how people in our industry normally sell wine and it is we learned very fast that this was not us and that nobody could sell wine better than us so we cloned ourselves and built a sales team this is half of our team you know this couple of six months ago um but we just in not a single one of these people is in this for the paycheck that they get they're in it because they love what they're doing they love being around us because we're passionate about everything the good news is if you're passionate about something not only do other people see it but potential investors see it and it makes it a lot easier to bridge that gap between hey I need money and hey do you want to be part of this so we've been able to Great to gather a great group of investors to help us get started and that's very true with even Kickstarter campaigns the most successful ones are because people are funding why someone's doing something not the actual end product so if you can incorporate that into your actual business it makes life a lot easier um speaking of easy I know everybody's you know either started a company or fundraised or trying to fundraise it's very very difficult don't let anyone ever tell you otherwise and if you can have just a little bit more passion in what you're doing then it's going to make life a lot easier uh that's pretty much it for my speech I tricked my co-founder to taking this picture so I wanted to work it in here and but yeah if you passionate about what you're doing then life's going to be a lot easier and everyone's going to see it and people are going to want to be around you and help you out along the way foreign

all right uh i'm tom preston hello and we are two of the four founders of uh chubby shorts um first off happy friday to everyone um i don't see nearly enough shorts in the audience but yeah so today we are talking about a very technical term of how to build a brand lovegasm and without further ado we'll jump into it so first our story basically background is uh we're four buddies from stanford uh who are all working random different odd jobs i was in venture capital preston was in the startup world uh one of the other guys was in finance one of the other guys was in retail at cap and we all were just kind of getting tired of the day-to-day and of reporting to people and wanted to be doing things for ourselves wanted to start something and there was just one fateful day where uh we decided on of all things making tiny shorts for men um and and uh and made just a really small crop back in uh the fourth for the fourth of july of 2011 for just our close buddies um and we had maybe like 10 left over we went to lake tahoe and everyone in our group was wearing them and then whatever we had left we were just carrying in backpacks went out and they we just sold out of everything that we had on our backpacks people were buying them off of our physical bodies um so it was really cool and and for us was really good kind of initial validation that hey at least you know 20 people like what we're up to um and and so that's when we decided to make a little bit more um and just kept kind of having this this routine of making you know 30 50 90 100 and selling them in person selling them at tailgates selling them going out in san francisco and and at some point we were just you know we decided uh it was time to kind of invest and and do a little bit more uh and so in september of 2011 we officially launched chubbyshorts.com um and uh and started selling online um and and for about you know the better part of that kind of fall winter it wasn't very exciting it was pretty mellow we were selling you know maybe 100 shorts a month or something like that um until our first spring and that's when things started going haywire um we took this picture during the that boring fall yeah pointy island shorts so we just might as well we are a very photogenic bunch the christmas card picture sent out to our small number of customers but hopefully it brightened all of their christmases yeah um so we got through our first holiday season it was it was exciting um and and we had one guy full time it was basically me working out of cafes um in january raynor one of the other co-founders jumped on and in march preston jumped on and that's when we really started to pick up steam and basically from march to july we were 100 sold out of inventory so we started doing a lot of pre-sales and selling products ahead of when we actually had them in stock so that we could finance the business we didn't want to raise any money we just wanted to be able to grow based on the consumer demand and people luckily were willing to wait one two and a you know sometimes almost three months to get the product and and then from then on it was it was a pretty solid growth pattern so um now you can see we're still very photogenic um take great just way more creative take the couch and put it outside yeah exactly and so now this is where we're at and um and you know there's there's a lot of it is fortune and a lot of it is is premeditated and so what we're going to try and do in the talk is is is lay out what we think are the really important pieces of building brand um and and brand to us is the emotional association a customer has with your company and with your products um and so our entire talk is about brand and that concept of really forging that association um and and uh so you know this is where we're at so um facebook we have 860 000 fans in you know two and a half years uh and i think that makes us first your second biggest in terms of just a men's focus brand on facebook and the other community stats you can see here a ton of social engagement our our customers a very young guy um and very willing to to be involved and participate in the brand that we've created which is totally awesome and we've seen a ton of success with social and then revenue-wise we've had a lot of good solid growth um and uh hope to see that you know lion continue ticking up into the right um so one thing i would maybe add to sorry to cut you off tommy is just the applicability to hopefully everyone here on brand maybe not everyone here is selling clothing online maybe no one else is but but the notion of a brand being important regardless of what you're doing being consumer facing we think really matters i think you guys are also probably realizing that it does matter as well that perception that a consumer has that a potential customer has of what you're doing as being the best and establishing that and finding ways to establish that really help so so hopefully this is just generally applicable to everyone here that brand does matter regardless of what you're doing yeah and so so here uh we're not going to try and be too prescriptive we're going to try and give what we found to be successful so that hopefully you guys can glean bits that are applicable to your specific business and your specific brands so basic outline for us that has been the formula for success and and building a really solid uh emotional connection with a custom base is first you have to have a great product you can market the heck out of something that's not very good and ultimately that will shine through um so it all is rooted in great product and as you can see we uh we have done that um second is relentlessly focus on content content from day one was an enormous part of our business the first thing that i wrote when i was sitting down to build the the website was this concept called the facts and it was basically laying out in content form a lot of very very branded and ridiculous details about the company and our manifesto which is uh basically our call uh to the uh to the previously cargo laden uh masses to toss them out and shorten up their shorts um but from from day one it was it was very rooted in content not just product third is community integration and this one was something that kind of uh happened to us as opposed to was was too premeditated as we started selling product and putting out content we started getting back content from our community and it was just natural to us to recycle that and integrate it into our website into our purchasing behavior and all that good stuff four is customer support to to have a great brand and this is something that that is now almost assumed but should not be trivialized is just customer service customer support and and being you're being always uh always having your customers back it's it's more than just customer service it is you are that guy that is there to help them out in any situation and we'll talk a little bit about that later and then five and this kind of runs through everything is authenticity uh hugely hugely hugely important um and one and the one specific facet where so many brands get off track um is authenticity um and we'll we'll talk about kind of the way that we think about that so that's the rough outline and we'll run through it so first great product we discussed this but but basically you have to ensure that what you're doing is high quality whether you're making shorts or you know software or whatever the product has to be on point and has to be something that people will be extremely happy with um yeah that's the basic i mean all you guys are building great things that's that's just step one to be able to build a brand around something it's got to be something worth building a brand around and this is just kind of assumed preston and i are the kind of marketing dudes and luckily we don't have to we have a great product team that helps us out with this second and where we get a lot more involved is is on content um so we are just extremely rigorous about content we think about our content organization in the same way that we would think you know comedy central would think about their content organization or you know uh jimmy fallon would think about his content organization we treat it as a media outlet and we think that everything that we put out has to be on a caliber of entertainment as all of those things so here you can see basically this is one of our social posts of the past week and this level of engagement we have about 1400 likes 21 shares and a few comments this level of engagement is very very very high if you go look at any other brand let alone men's brand getting your community to get involved like this uh is tough and and luckily we've been fortunate enough um to uh to be able to have this level of engagement um but this is an example of something where a customer sends us a photo and then we take the time to kind of caption it in an interesting and unique way isn't salesy we don't ever try and sell products on our social channels we just want to give people something interesting and entertaining in their newsfeed um and and it seems to work and seems to pay off one thing i would add is is it's maybe applicable to obviously you're not going to necessarily be posting pictures of of someone working at their computer using your software or something like that but but high level although that could be pretty cool you might and maybe it works i'm not gonna say don't do it but the general notion of making your customer in some way a hero is potentially something that can apply to to what you're doing and and be a very authentic we get to authenticity in a second but be a very authentic authentic representation of wow this is this is kind of the value in some crazy way of that i'm bringing to the world or or that real people are experiencing through what i'm doing so making the customer the hero the other the and this kind of brings like one of the first big points about content is that content is shareable um into in this day and age there are many ways that people can share best is people talking about it but second best is people commenting liking and sharing uh in social media channels these are all indicative of potential conversations that people can have that's kind of the way that we think about it and here you see you know 300 likes is 300 opportunities for this piece of content to get dispersed into other people's news feeds who have never heard about chubbies and then their first experience is not only seeing the social validation from their friend but also seeing that on a great piece of content that has been validated so um step you know number one about content is it's very shareable when you do it right um and and facebook is is kind of mecca for us getting these pieces of content distributed throughout other people's news feeds without paying for it is huge um and so that's step one um and here here you've got uh we're just going to run through a few homepage assets that we have so these are kind of the first things that a person would see coming to the site and so you can see just there's always an interplay of the photograph and the copy that we always have never salesy we don't do discounts we don't do promos uh this is the extent of what we do um and so we'll just run through them relatively quickly it's done just you know if you have your comments out a bunch of fun being had obviously i think that's one thing to say about that uh protest the top button we do a lot around uh not business casual uh workwear um and so uh this is kind of getting to the notion of of you know live the dream live the weekend all the time and and the top button is is one of our enemies just as pants are dehydration is no joke this is just a public service announcement um this is serious that's good the other the other thing to really recognize is that everything is content from your labels uh to internals to packaging to your emails to your order confirmation emails anything that a customer sees from your brand is an opportunity to have a positive content experience so here you can see a few examples we ship out koozies with all of our orders and they're not just a utility to keep your hand warm while you're drinking a cold beer there there's always content on them this tank top that you see is one of the one of the hottest commodities that we've got and we don't sell it it's all loyalty item and you know we see this going on ebay for 50 to 60 bucks and then you can see the top left our box it's another content experience first time customer opens that up they get a hearty boom shakalaka when they when they open up their first box bottom right getting emails from chubby's makes my day that's awesome and then this bottom left here is an order confirmation email where we insert a lot of branded copy a lot of content and just opportunities for people to get more involved talk about it with their friends share it one thing i would add is is you may think about okay well content content strategy that's that's always sort of generally talked about in in none of these examples is there a mention of just our blog or having a blog as that being the manifestation of content it's um i think it's just generally thinking through every touch point that a person has with what you're doing and thinking of how you can make that exceptional from start to finish and so you have a surprising number of opportunities when you think about all those different touch points to wow the customer that is is seeking out what you're doing and so it's it's not necessarily just hey get a blog it's just think through every touch point as an opportunity to provide an entertaining brand building experience yeah and the last thing i put on here is is that content doesn't have to be copy video content can be a shareable experience one of the examples is we sent out about a thousand packages of big league chew just randomly to folks who ordered on like a random tuesday and that created a content experience because they all shared it on twitter talked about it with their friends and hopefully shared shared some delightful bubble gum uh there amigos um so once again stressing this but content is your voice content is the brand uh first is why content is important second people share it people talk about it it gives people a different reason to to promote your brand and especially with guys guys aren't often talking about that you know new fashion item that they purchased they'd much rather talk about a funny video or funny piece of content and third and and uh more subtly content and something that we learned along the way is content serves as a model for user generated content um so our content that we put out um then is replicated by our customers sending it back in i don't think when we started this we thought that we would start getting thousands of guy selfies every week which is awesome yeah that's fantastic but we do and it's guys wearing hawaiian shirts and uh guys looking ridiculous and going out and having fun and we didn't realize at first that that would be the response to what we were doing we were just having fun and marketing to our buddies but that's what it turned into and it was just totally awesome and one of the things that i would take as as subtle but impactful with your content strategy and in the next three minutes that we have we'll zoom through the rest of the presentation okay three is uh community integration um so this is related to the third point of why content but really work to integrate your compu your community and support your community uh these are all user generated photos none of this was taken by us uh and frankly just couldn't have been this guy is like 40 feet in the air on a motorcycle not any of us could do that um and yeah so i guess we can keep on running through so so this is our instagram account um most of what we do in social media is taking uh our customers photos and turning them into heroes with a caption and promoting their photo and when people see this they get so excited tag their buddies tell everyone they know about it and this has been really really awesome for us uh our customers are our best photographers our best content producers um and and uh we really like to highlight that um and whatever it is i mean for for you guys it's i think it takes a while to establish a consistency and expectation for what you you choose to do if you do choose to do something on social or if you do choose to find a variety of other channels you can use to communicate with your potential folks is over time people started to understand that this is sort of how it worked that there was this notion of i'm going to submit my photo in hopes that they'll actually turn me into a hero and and make me look the best way i can possibly look in front of my set of friends and then this broader community as well and so people then it became sort of this reinforcing cycle but um allow that to happen for for whatever you choose it may not be this but but allow that to happen so someone can start to understand and have that understanding and expectation so that it can sort of start to build but but that first part takes a little while um and so there are a lot of different ways you can integrate your community here we're also providing hero images of our customers as model shots on our website and we've seen statistically that having user generated content on these pages increases conversion rate people get excited when they see it it provides social validation and it provides these guys with a reason to tell their buddies about it so a really big thing for us that we've recently learned is just this integration uh should just be throughout your business yes these are our values you see and yes our customers are awesome second way that our community gets involved is in basically aiding in our manufacturing decisions so this is a concept that we launched a few weeks ago called chubby's labs where we can just put out ridiculous over-the-top concepts without actually manufacturing them and have our community pre-purchase them it only activates if a certain number are purchased and this has been really cool so we ran this with a few state flag shorts because previously we had done a lot of state flag activations but only around the states where we knew there were a lot of customers or knew there would be sufficient traction to justify the manufacturing here we got to take a shot and then give people you know six different state flag shorts and only make the ones where we had a lot of traction and a lot of shareability and so this is another way to really involve your community that makes them feel special makes them feel exclusive number four is customer support customer service uh here are just brief tidbits uh this slide used to be just full and it just didn't look good so uh we trimmed it down uh but basically our customer service reps uh are you know that front line and the voice of our brand and so um you gotta have great customer support and and we don't outsource it we don't think that's the right way to do it uh because brand and voice are so important um we in-house all of the customer service and if you call into chubby's you'll be greeted very warmly so i recommend you guys check it out but people really really respond to it and once again it turns into a content experience where people will share and and tell their friends about it the other thing i would add is is often times tom and myself are also taking phone calls from folks and i would just say as your company starts to grow don't allow yourself to get removed from answering the phones even if it's just a couple times a day but it's just so valuable to continue to have that interaction and use it as an opportunity to ask questions of how are you liking this or just to thank them or or do whatever but but still being my personal phone number is on one of our box inserts so i randomly get calls from folks asking for refills of their referral cards and it's awesome to know that a guy just handed out five business cards that have a promo code to get a gift with their first chubby's purchase but it's also awesome then that they call in to get more of those cards and it's a great opportunity to just be able to do the things that i just mentioned but don't allow yourself to get detached from that as you grow so there's a lot of different ways to support your customers one of the ways we found uh that's just a case study of not of going above and beyond is uh we saw just this random guy who is a customer of ours made a video of himself in kind of old spice fashion asking miss texas out on a date to his you know formal um here is his reaction and a you know a videotape of him reacting to miss texas accepting his offer on the news um and so we took it upon ourselves to get him a bouquet of flowers book a limo for him to and from uh his his formal uh and hooked him up with a few free pairs of shorts to make his experience that much better and that's something we're just randomly we saw it locked onto it coordinated it and did it and it went above and beyond for this guy and and made a huge huge difference he told his friends about it shared it on social media really really cool and a way that you can turn all of these into really cool content experiences um yeah and and another example of this uh that we didn't have good photographic stuff for is uh there was a guy who emailed in saying that his chubbies were stolen at the gym and so obviously we replaced them but we also did is is we figured this guy could use some help we booked him for uh self-defense classes and so we got him into uh we got into uh some karate classes and uh it was really cool really funny really shareable number five is be authentic um that guy is authentic right there so this is you gotta live your brand uh everything that you're doing needs to feel good it needs to feel right um and the way that this this kind of manifests is us is just picture your brand as a person that's talking to people that's sharing things uh would you want to hang out with that person um and in this case yeah i mean it's pretty answer is clear um but but this really pushes the notion of don't sell don't be in people's faces uh no one likes when their friends are like non-stop posting about them coming to their events or whatever so so just think of it in that way and you'll be like oh wow yeah i guess people probably wouldn't like to see that uh and and for us we don't ever try and sell selling feels bad by all means we'll give customers the opportunity to buy and and the content inspiration to buy but we're never trying to sell we're never doing the you know hey comment this to get uh all sorts of free stuff um we we use the content to provide that drive as opposed to creating an artificial experience and so one of the most authentic ways you can come across is in person an example of this is we just bought a gigantic rv that's going to be touring the country and going to tailgates throughout the fall where the whole rationale is to bring people together and have a good time we're going to we're ideally you know long term going to be kind of the espn college game day but for having fun um and so so what we're going to be doing is we're going to deck this thing out with a bar dance floor dj booth all sorts of stuff like that so that um we are that that that just mecca of fun at all of these tailgates and and for us the best way that we come across is in person the best experiences people can have and the most authentic is just talking to us we've seen we've seen this time and time again is is when people come away from an in-person experience with us they're that much more stoked and it gives people a real tangible understanding of who we are and what we do um so don't downplay this get out and hang with your customers meet them tell them about what you're doing people are always interested in your stories because you know they know your brand and they already love your brand they just they want to learn more about it and no better way to bring the brand you're building whatever it is and whatever it stands for to life so closing um you know basically a repetition but but focus on great product um that's the baseline second crazy focus on content um constant editing don't let things through that don't feel good uh three integrate your community they serve as even more content and giving them that validation is huge uh four gotta have great customer support um and that can also turn into content experiences and five is be authentic um and so with that i hope we have time for questions i'm not sure i think we went like 30 minutes over we do have time for questions thank you thank you everyone thank you thank you for listening appreciate it come on down if you have questions for the chubbies guys we can take probably two or three chubby chubby guys chubby guys chubby fellas chubby fellows hi there i was wondering um in a sea of technology startups once you got started and it became difficult how did you stick with this idea especially you know in fashion among a bunch of guys so first off we don't consider ourselves a fashion company we are a beer brand that happens to sell shorts um uh second is that this is the most fun that we could ever imagine having um i was i was actually all set to go to business school when i when we started this and once this started picking up there's just no other thought in my mind um and uh you know honestly i'm working with my best friends um and the people that we've hired in the company are the greatest people ever and the other piece is that it's it's different um people don't expect it uh which is really cool and really fun the the other two things i'd quickly add one being able to see that initial part that tom was talking about we're just we have shorts in our backpack and we're walking around san francisco and people are just saying i want the things that you have on do you have any i will buy them right now seeing that even though it was we did that maybe 10 times in total you saw wow there's something there's some reaction that a person is having that seems like this could touch more people and have a similar impact on more people so that even if there are tough times you you remember moments like that the other thing is just we wear these things every day so as it relates to the product you're making whatever if it's shorts or if it's software whatever it is using it every day and loving it every day if you're just honestly doing that that means something great presentation um where did you guys get your first pair of chubbies designed and did where did you decide to manufacture and how did you find a manufacturer so that's just legwork honestly uh when you're when you're getting into this world in the world of manufacturing it's just a lot of legwork so it started with a google search uh and then was just us going out and visiting manufacturers google search did not work at all but but it's talking to people asking them who they work with so you know u.s manufacturing is very very dispersed people don't unify it up you know vertically so there's a manufacturer who works with all sorts of fabric suppliers who works with all sorts of button suppliers and so as you get down the funnel you ask each and every one of them with whom they're working and then you start getting references you start doing your exploration so when you get referred to a fabric guy from this manufacturer then you ask that fabric guy what manufacturers do you work with and then you go meet other manufacturers but it was a long process definitely aided by the fact that we had a guy who had worked at the gap in levi's before but totally totally not it is a competitive advantage to be able to put in that work because a lot of people don't um and uh so yeah i got it it's just a lot of you know hitting the pavement but it's well worth it did you design the shorts yourself or did you outsource that uh we designed the look but we're not pattern makers so so patterns are basically the way that a cutter will cut the fabric and design the way that should be sewn together we don't do that but basically we had the cut and the look that we wanted and then we went through multiple revs with a pattern maker to finally get the exact feel and look that we had in our mind so kind of both i guess because you're manufacturing in the us did you commit to a smaller batch at first and then go larger yes uh but yeah yes definitely um but how one of the innovations that i think really helped out our business was that was was the concept of garment dying for us basically we made a bunch of white shorts and then dyed them different colors and and that really helped us because we could make a whole lot of white shorts and then sell 10 different products where we're not too heavily inventoried but that was never a huge issue for us because we were sold out since march and have and up until the point where we were big enough scale that just didn't matter anymore um we were just selling out so so it was it was in the early days a story of how can we maximize um variety based on a single kind of manufacture but now it's it's a lot different cool thanks thank you hello uh so i'm 48 i hate those kind of stuff things like you look like ridiculous when you wear that so how can you to each their own to each their own we'll get yourself all right that's all right i'm french so i have to do something so you have to be excited so um how can you i was listening carefully i had to make a call but i was listening carefully so how can you convince me to that it's cool and what what great product all right but what what's what's what's the specific thing your friends will convince you your friends will start wearing it and then they'll tell you all about i have no choice yeah really you think my friend's okay you will start to become unfashionable always good to end with a trolling comment there so uh thanks very much i hate what you do all right thank you so much

how to make money uh from basically just blogging so what is priceonomics um if you talk to almost anyone what we're known for is being a really big interesting blog um we're a team of half writers half engineers and we had an observation in the market like newspapers are dying blogs are like being able to like print out hundreds of millions of page views a month but all of them just make money from ads so they have all this traffic but like they don't really know how to make money so that's like one half of the world just content sites that are all like dying and then the other half the world are like Silicon Valley startups and these people already know how to sell software for a lot of money but their problem is they don't really know how to get traffic like when you start your company that's going to be the hardest thing how do you get users how do you get distribution how do you get traffic and so our observation what made the difference for us is we said well what if we combined the two what if we became a really really great content site that basically used that content to occasionally promote our own services and that's what we did at priceonomics our main product is we crawl data for hedge funds and tech companies and they pay us between $2 to $110,000 a month to get them a feet of that data every month and the one the only way we get customers is by writing about data and attracting people that way so this talk today is going to be about basically how do you create great content like that they can power your whole business but like you know I think this will be a pretty honest conversation we'll try to be honest um and I think a lot of speakers will be honest with you about like how do you get there and a lot of times when you read Tech crunch or you read in a venture beat it sounds like it's this great linear path like we came up with this idea and then we were successful it took us a long time to get there so let's start about the history of priceonomics um part of the reason our name is priceonomics even though it probably doesn't have to be um was I had this idea um I sort of like love getting great deals on things and I found a bike I really liked on Craigslist I bought it for $300 and it turned out I didn't really like it after like a week so I put it on Craigslist again and I sold it for $1,000 a week later and I was like this is not how a market should really work you know there should be like really great price transparency about how much uh a bike is like this is ridiculous so I like told some friends we built a team together we're like well let's just crawl through Craigslist and eBay and see how much these bikes are selling for or like iPhones are selling for or anything are selling for so we built these crawlers we built this website and it was going to be like Kelly Blue Book for everything um and it was called priceonomics and we built this thing and it was sort of like a side project all of us were doing other things i' had started a different company years before I was happily running that and like well this sounds like a cool idea why don't we apply to Y combinator uh and then you know to our surprise we got in and it sort of like oh crap now we have to turn this into a company it wasn't like we were like so passionate about being a price guide but now we're like stop doing this um and so we got into a one combinator and we're like well you know the one thing they tell you there is you have to figure out a way to grow and early on basically the only way we were getting users was from Google uh people would Google like how much is my track 5,000 bike worth and there weren't a lot of results for that because you know like as my example from uh arbitraging bikes tells you like there was no data about that uh so we were showing up and it was like going pretty well and we're like well how can we grow faster well we need more links you know we need like people to cover us we need like basically to do well in Google you need a lot of content you need people to link to you so you have a lot of authority so we're like all right well let's start a blog um and we can write about our data like the Okay Cupid blog was really huge then and and we thought like well let's just do what they did and you know write about data um and I'll sort of like talk you through a little bit about like how we started off and how it was sort of advantageous some of the things we did in the beginning that accidentally alled us to go down the path of mostly blogging um and like we did that and it worked pretty well and we started like going up the ranks in Google and we were in YC and we man manag to raise like you know over a million dollars in funding afterwards from great Angel Investors and like from the outside World it looked like it's sort of perfect startup you're getting to live the dream um but internally like every day we look at the numbers and it was all driven by Google like other than our blog um all the users were just coming in from Google and then one day like it would go down 20% and then it might go up 10% or might go down 50% or might go up 100% but it really like eventually we figured out that like these aren't our users these are Google's users and eventually like you know are we going to be able to build a real business just off the back of Google we have to like think about something else um and so while we were doing this through being a linator and being in Silicon Valley you just get to meet a lot of other people that are doing startups people would always come to us and ask like Hey we're trying to crawl these enormous websites that's all you guys do is like crawling through these sites that have so much data how do you get them can you help us with this we're always like all right yeah we'll have coffee with you tell tell you about this eventually someone was like well you know can we pay you for this data you're getting um we're like no we don't want like we don't want that crazy we we a price guide um and then eventually we're like well well you I guess would you pay $2,000 a month like we just threw out a really absurdly high number I was going to say like $200 a month um and they said yeah okay we're like oh okay well that's like way more money than we were making from this like maintaining this hug site that's One customer so that's when everything clicked we started to have this business model in place so we like we'd write great content that sometimes involve crawling data from the web people would find out about us a very very small percentage of them would like contact us and say hey we need this sort of data and those people we would charge anywhere between $2 to $110,000 a month um and then once we like figured out that model then it was a little bit more repeatable and we could write more awesome stuff we could sell more stuff um and so that's sort of like the story about how we got here um and like there were so many times in that little story I told you where we just totally could have died you know um but the one thing that always like stuck with people was that they really liked our blog and that was like the one thing that we always stoked was that we got to write really interesting content we got to find cool data we got to share it we got to like Stoke this thing that people love um and that ended up saving us and letting us like figure out and try new things that we could like sell to our audience uh and that's where we are today so this talk is sort of aimed at you who's just trying to start a company and who wants to make great content so you can get like in the newspaper or Tech crud or wherever um so that like people can find out about you so you can Market your products so you can test out new things and so you can get distribution um and like as you're thinking about how do you Market your startup or how do you write a blog post that like promotes yourself just remember this that no one cares like and don't feel bad about that like when you email someone like they're busy doing their job they have like a million other things they don't care about like what you just email them they they probably don't have a mental overhead to even process it and I don't take it personally just like no one cares um so you're going to have to just really really stand out and make other make people like demand to care like that you are so special that like you help them do their job or you're just so interesting that they care and that's really the only way to get through in my you know opinion and so we have one philosophy about like marketing PR anything and that is like information information for us is currency like we're in the business of like just giving people information um and why do we do that yeah it helps us like you know sell things cuz sometimes we sell that information to people but mostly like think about you want to get coverage somewhere online and this person this reporter like they're doing their job and that's a lot of work it takes a lot of time to like research a company to write a blog post to do anything and how can you convince that person spend the time to write about you like would you like write a book report about some random person that talked to you on the street like that would that would like kill your week so like why don't you do something that can make their lives just way way easier like give them a report that like if they write about it they will look incredible like one of the first things we wrote about that like really had a lot of currency or did really well was um we craw through every like iPhone and figured out how much they were depreciating over time and we also craw through every Android phone and found out how much they were deeing it over time and we also this was like two years ago so Blackberry two and a half years ago so black was even like a thing um and we figured out how much blackberries were depreciating over time we came up with this index it was like oh it looks like iPhones depreciate the less the least they're like the best resale value compared to Androids or blackberries and we wrote that and like all of a sudden like nothing really happened in the beginning like we just wrote it we put it in our Blog then we like emailed like a few places we emailed like gigo we Emil te we email Venture beat um and eventually like one of them saw it and and wrote about it cuz like that was a story for them like iPhones had the lowest appreciation and like that's not like he didn't have to like put in a ton of work to like do the calculations himself or write about it and that made him look like really smart it helped him do his job it brought new information in the world and then that led to like a torrential like you know like everyone then covered this thing that like iPhones are number one in depreciation According to priceonomics which was just like a couple of dudes um but that was in the New York Times that was in like the Wall Street Journal that was everywhere um and so like just give people information because like otherwise you're going to be like can you write about me and they'll say why you won't have a good answer other than I would like you to you know so how did we get started like and what do I Define as information it could be like awesome data that you your company puts together or is byproduct of your company but it can also be like an anecdote that only you or your company authentically know um and like what do I I mean by that when we when we first launched uh it was right before Christmas and we had arranged for like um because we're a wi combinator they like helped us make sure like Tech runch would write about promic Kelly Blue Book for everything and we were like why us to write a blog post too about like our company with the launch um and I wrote this thing up that was like cuz there was Christmas time and like we're price guide it was like five used things you can buy your wife for Christmas or something like something very lame like but I just thought like well this is what a Blog is supposed to do like you talk about your product you like shamelessly plug it like it's not supposed to be that popular it's just like a Blog um and so but the thing was like Tech is going to write about us before Christmas but they ended up writing about us on like the 26th so I read this blog post all ready to go like that I was going to like post afterwards after we launched about like you know Christmas presents but it was after Christmas so I couldn't do it I could I couldn't write about this thing um so by accident I like well I got to produce something this today and what do I know about so I thought like well one interesting thing we did last week was we um emailed all our friends and Y combinator and we're like hey um we were testing out our data and we're buying Aon chairs and we'll like buy them on Craigslist and then we'll resell them to you and markup um and so we would like sell them for $400 and then Source them online using our data for like you know $300 $350 and that to me was like okay well I you can write about that like it's not like that much about our product really but it's more about how we did this how would we like go out there and find these chairs and try to get people and like try to rip off our classmates by taking their money um and that ended up being like such a better story like people actually like it was authentic it was stuff that we knew even though it was just an anecdote about us um and then like that ended up on Hacker News it was the number one uh article there uh it was in like um all things D it was in like all these places that like if we just written like the boring thing about our company nothing would have happened so in the beginning every time we wrote a blog post it would take us at least 40 hours um so when you you like read it it might even not even be that many words um it might look kind of breezy the tone like someone just dashed it off like um but that was never the case like it would take so much time for us to assemble the data for us to figure out how to visualize it and for us to tell a story um we wrote things like the fix the Hipster fixie bike index where we figured out like where in America fixed gear bikes were selling the most um and like doing that is a lot of work like you have to a lot of data to figure that out um and we publ out that when Gang Busters we did something about San Francisco rent prices um over a year ago before like people really were able to quantify how fast the prices were increasing in the city and I got 30,000 Facebook likes but it took us like almost a month to pull that data together and visualize it um we've done stuff where we compared Airbnb prices to hotel prices by crawling through all these massive websites um and like those ones like that use a lot of data take a lot of time but even the ones that don't involve a lot of data that we just write about because we want to bring new information in the world they we put a ton a ton a ton of effort into it sometimes we don't put that much effort into it though um this was like our most popular blog post ever it was called how much does the Costa book your favorite band uh we thought it was like kind of a crappy blog post uh someone had sent us this data about like how much does it cost a book like Madonna versus like Justin Timberlake versus like everyone um and we just like threw in our blog it took us like no time um and because we had been doing this so long and people were sort of expecting interesting information from us we sort of started to have like all these advantages now that we put something up there and like this one blog post got uh 1.2 million views and over 100,000 Facebook likes and we just like threw it on there we thought like we're not even going to send this to our email list it's not good enough no one will care um and so and like that didn't really drive us any I mean we got like a million visitors in a day it didn't really like drive any business to us um but at the same time we got a lot of business that day um and how that happened we had also written a piece earlier about Retail Me Not um and we had craw through all their Google search fors to show how awesome they were at SEO um and how that 71% of the time they were the number one result for coupon related uh Google searches and then that same day we had that massive Madonna uh Spike uh Retail Me Not um Panda the Google's Panda search update hit retail may not got creamed um and their stock price dropped like 30% in a day because they were getting all their traffic from Google and then all these hedge fund analysts uh started Googling like Retail Me Not SEO data and we just showed up and like that day like almost every big head fun on wall screet emailed us and it was the same day that like Madonna was going viral on our site but something else that we had written unrelated was then really taking off and driving business um so as you do this you'll have your own rules about like making interesting authentic information ours is like bring information be right be interesting like we want to basically make contents it's like the most interesting articles that are in the business section in the New York Times or their Wall Street Journal um and you don't have to like you know you don't have to like reinvent the wheel every time like now we we have like themes like you can tap into like a really popular subculture we wrote about like the business of fish sometime like we you can like just write stuff that like people feel good when they share it um some information for us that's like really surprising or we like saying like something is [ __ ] um and like or the economics of food trucks or economics of um you know anything um you can tell a story about like how you guys started started about how one of your friends started a company you know the hero cycle as an entrepreneur um you can just post a chart that tells an interesting story um you you can come up with various themes that like you keep hitting over and over and then in the beginning you have to basically do some work to make it spread um and after a while like I mean in the beginning like you'll write something it'll be really cool but nothing will happen unless you like sort of push it and the good news is that like if you push it a little bit it can really really spread because of Facebook because like one blog reads another blog whatever you need to get mention like once or twice or you need to like get on like some subreddit or you need to get like somewhere on Hacker News um and then eventually it'll just Avalanche uh and that's like the beauty of the beauty of like content today is that you don't have that many disadvantages versus just being like the New York Times you know like they rely on people sharing it on Facebook just like you rely on people sharing on Facebook Facebook if you make something as good as what's in the New York Times people don't care if it's on your little blog or the New York Times like you're just sharing it on Twitter they're just sharing on Facebook they're just a blogger needing to some data to write about and they'll write about you just as quickly as they'll write about something that's in the economist in New York Times um so like put in a little effort up front to like you know email a journalist and say hey here's this quick here's a study we wrote you might like it you know and do those things they really pay off and eventually like uh um eventually it will like become easier you know like that article we wrote that had a million visitors that wouldn't have happened the first day that we get a million visitors when we WR something like you have this cumulative advantage over time so stick with it it's not it's not easy um and then finally like we were so like we l our content so much that we're like not all of us needs to necessarily even promote our business like 10% of it needs to 90% of it just needs to be good um and we found it was so good we like loved it so much so authentically we even put it in a book called Everything is [ __ ] and we self-published it um and a month ago we just like put it on our blog we didn't do anything and that month it sold $20,000 with a like profit for us uh and it was the number one econ book on Amazon when we launched it above like Freakonomics um and that was just like the level of intensity that we put into making our blog really really really good that like we're like we think it's so good that people would buy these recycled blog posts um and we added new content to it but it was really just a testament to like a commitment to making good things and that they would spread um so thank you that's price [Music] Ms thank you uh if you guys have a question please come down unique opportunity to speak to one of the best content experts I see actually question here awesome presentation enjoyed it definitely have to check you guys out after this uh so I just have a question about how you get inspiration I guess for your content it seems like you take a lot of time to develop it so what do you do and and what stands out I got I guess about writing it uh um I guess like we just get struck by things that we find are interesting and we start with that like um like the other day we were talking about like the witness protection program over lunch like wait a minute is that a thing like do people actually go in a witness protection program like what happens to their Facebook profiles like yeah know like and then we like have a lunch conversation and they were're like well why don't we just it's not that much work to dig into it and so like now right now someone's working on a like a piece about like how the witness protection program works um and like it's just sort of like an AAL decision like this seems interesting to us um and like sometimes we like you know well for every like good idea we have we have to like 10 bad ideas um but like we really just focus on like something we find that strikes us as interesting cool thanks hey how you doing so I'm Michael my company's lot of stops which I call Air Traffic Control for delivery um but I'm curious did Madonna bookings increase after that blog post uh I would I would guess not I'm just kidding um no my question is and maybe I wasn't paying attention in the beginning is so is your Revenue model you being hired to do data research for other companies our a revenue model is basically um we will crawl the web like in a customized way for people um and so like if you ever like start a company that involves like a lot of data like you're like crawling through like a retailer site all the time or you're crawling through um a Marketplace or whatever like it requires at least one full-time person possibly like a team of full-time people and these sites are always changing they're pain in the butt you might get blocked like all these they're all these like very ID syncratic things about like getting data and so what our business model is we basically will do that for a company we just specialize in that so we can just get them to feed to the data and while for them it would take like a full-time team at least one person possibly like one or two and the person would hate doing it for us we like love doing it and we like focus on that so that's that is like you know 80% of our Revenue okay so if you get backlogged on requests from other companies what do you do there do you Outsource it uh no I mean we're sort of like building the platform to make it easier every time like the first time we did it uh it took us like a couple months to like really get the data in the right way then the next time we did it took us like a month now it takes us like two weeks to set up a customer on our platform and eventually the goal is to like make it so that a customer could sort of run the data on their on our platform uh and monitor like oh this site changed and now my crawler not working or this thing happened um but for now it's like every time we're like building this plane as it's flying in terms of like making it easier for a companies to get data cool well I enjoyed your talk thank thank you hi uh I'm Amy um I come from the editorial content side of things so I was wondering if you could speak a little bit more like data calling for dummes the sort of the technical side of things um the data that you're finding like oldfashioned ways all the research that editors have to do to optimize that and make it quicker but to understand the TCH side I think would sort of help a lot yeah so there there's like all this stuff about data journalism out there today like you know 538 or box or things like that and people are like well um and when people apply to our jobs for writer they're like hey you know I I know I had a CW data like I did this their project um but like for our writers we don't have them do any of the crawling um because the the one the data that we want is so like hard to get we want like real real professionals to get it um and almost nothing we do could be done by someone that was just like doing it as a hobby or like as a side thing and so you know like other people out there might like have writers to like get the data too but we like split it up so we have like the Professionals in professional data crawling we have the writers like do the professional writing um and so yeah our philosophy is that it's like too difficult to do it unless you really specialize it and and crawling it's um I assume there's a technical side of how the crawling happens and then probably synthesizing the data as well is that what the Crawlers do uh the craw I mean no I mean typically like I end up synthesizing it you know like or you know someone on our team does but it's typically me because I want to put my stamp of approval that like every time we put something out there it has to be right um and if it's not right we lose all our credibility if we're going to go say that like Airbnb prices are this much versus hotels it has to really really be right um and so ultimately like nothing gets out the door without me either doing it or approving it so it's if you're an Editor to go to somebody like you it's best to not mess up right so like so like if you feel uncomfortable with it like any time you put something on the Internet like someone will know it better than you um and so you have to like keep that in mind that like you have to really really be right because it'll get out if you make a mistake or it has to be done in a way like don't give an opinion on something that you're not 100% sure about like have the scope of the argument very very narrow so that you are the expert in that at least narrow question so how do you source that call data if you are an editor uh like who is who is an expert like who could someone go to um I mean basically yeah I mean you have to like sort of work with an engineer I think to like to get it sure hey there my name is mjal sha um so my question is I had a couple questions about why combinator um so my buddy got in and chose not to join uh so my question I it's kind of two-part um number one you know what the percentage of people who get in uh that choose not to go and the second is uh what the opportunity cost to not joining is um like I would never not do it like like people always like come up to me and are like Hey how do you raised money and like how did you do this and I'm like I have no idea how I did it I just got into YC and it was so much easier um so it like the best thing ever it's sort of like you got in decided not to do it I don't know that would be weird yeah iig that's what I always tell him so I fig maybe could be a future blog post or something just about like the economics of of projecting white comat what it really means it's like I mean economics Liv makes so much sense like cuz I don't I don't even know how we would have raised money like the key thing about I think like when people like people email me all the time like hey can you help me raise money like how did you do it can you introduce me to this person and like no one wants to give money to someone that wants their money you know like that's a real problem like if you just get a cold email like hey like uh I'm doing this startup i c email you like can you give me money they will always say no because it just signals like this person I don't know signals they want my money which means there must be something deficient about them um whereas like being an incubator at least like why combinator they they ATT tra that away the investors are forced to talk to people and instead it looks like oh well these people don't really necessarily need my money I must there must be something great about about them I have to give my them my money now yeah I'm with you I I just figured that way I can uh take something back and show them something uh you know like a blog post saying that he's wrong we got time for two more questions but if we can do it within the next two minutes great question I'm Ben Harvey I'm intern in San Francisco and I also started a company but um I'm you said you only use blog so I'm kind of wondering like what's your advice or what do you think about other social media platforms as an opportunity to grow yeah I mean when I said we only use our blog like eventually where most of the traffic comes in through is Facebook um and like a bit of it comes through Twitter too and like journalists hang out on Twitter and it's great like for tracking what's going on but I mean today like part of the cool thing is that so much traffic comes from Facebook or Twitter or other places that really doesn't matter where you wrote it like you could write it on your website you could write it on medium you could write it on like the New York Times you could write it on Tech and like the tra is coming from Facebook so like you have a sort of democratizing where you can put content my question I just thought you meant only blog so app um really quick do you have any tips on like how you structure the sharing links do you like to put them to the top on the bottom on the side is there particular service to add them in did you custom write that Plugin or like um so like I think we've never known a really good answer uh we put them at the top we put them at the bottom and our blog posts are so long that I think we can kind of tell is some people just share it right away without possibly reading 3,000 words and then some of them like they get to the end and then they they will share them but I think a lot of the data shs this isn't necessarily our data this sort of my gut is that people will just share it on Facebook like naturally or they'll email it naturally like they might even use your buttons they'll just like be like oh this thing was so awesome I have to go to my Facebook feed and paste the link in um and so a lot of it is just like people if it's really great people will share it no matter how crap your buttons are all right thank you [Applause]

uh our next speaker is matt fielder matt's the co-founder of vinyl me please a kick-ass record of the month club with over 2000 subscribers matt uh is flying in from boulder colorado to be here which is awesome and he's going to describe some of the things that he's learned while growing by me please and just a reminder for the lightning talks there will be no q a but they're all going to be hanging out throughout the day so you can ask all your questions then hi guys my name like sam said is matt fiedler i'm one of the co-founders of vinyl please so finally please is a record of the month club designed to create an experience around music every month we feature one record that we believe to be essential and package it up with a custom cocktail pairing and a limited edition art print and send it out to subscribers worldwide so every month we ship out our records worldwide to more than 2000 subscribers in addition to the record subscribers get access to something called the standard which is a weekly digest covering the latest in music and lifestyle so when we first started this idea back at the end of 2012 we had like many of you a kernel of an idea we wanted to get feedback from it we wanted to understand what people thought about it what if they were interested in a service like this and more or less if they'd be willing to pay for it so we solicit a lot of our friends families co-workers and whatnot trying to get their understanding and what we got back was a lot of negative feedback people said that they weren't willing to pay for something like this that they were skeptical of getting a record that they may or may not like or that they potentially already had labels said that it just won't work that people have tried to do it before and failed pretty miserably we even talked to an executive at the country's largest vinyl pressing plant and he basically said that was a dumb idea but thanks for trying so as you can imagine we were pretty demoralized by this we had put ourselves out there we had an idea that we believed in and we really wanted people to be as excited about it as we were but we didn't get that but it's okay because we were young and stupid so we decided to do it anyways so toward the end of 2012 when we were getting ready to launch this company we created a landing page using launch rock and basically just tried to collect as many email addresses as we could of people that might be interested in this service we shared it on our personal facebook pages asked some friends and families to share it as well and ended up collecting about 100 email addresses at the end of the month so when we were ready to launch at the beginning of 2013 we sent an email out to all those hundred people asking them to sign up of the hundred we got 12 converted into paying subscribers so this may not sound like a lot but we had 12 people paying us real money that was like we were totally blown away by that fact we couldn't believe that people would trust us to send them music let alone with their credit card information so this was something that was really cool for us it really made us realize that maybe there is you know maybe this kernel of an idea there's something here that there are potentially people that would be interested in paying for something like this so as we kept going we started to grow pretty slowly we got from 12 to 25 to 40 to 50 eventually by the end of the summer we got to about a hundred and we it was just my co-founder and i we had bootstrapped the whole thing we hadn't spent a dollar on marketing we relied solely on word of mouth and so fast forward to the end of the year we have 250 subscribers we have a team of four people and it's still a pretty cute side business you know it's nothing to write home about we're not making any money from it it's nothing that we can sustain one person let alone four people on so we kind of had to have a gut check you know we had to we had to think about is this something that we really want to do or is it just going to be a side project forever and what we ultimately decided is that we were going to pour everything that we had into this company we decided that we were going to overall overhaul our packaging redesign our website refine our messaging we were going to put ourselves out there even further doing cold calls and emails and trying to get as much media coverage as we could and eventually some smaller things started to hit and we started to grow a little bit quicker and then some large scale things started to hit and we started to grow exponentially to now we're we're over 2 000 customers in 35 countries worldwide and it's sustaining four people full time so as i look back at this it's hard it's hard not to think about where we came from and you know in thinking about this we we learned a lot and we have grown a lot we've done a lot and we still have a lot of things to do and a lot of stuff to learn but we've built something that people really care about and that's what matters to us and so what i've learned through this process is that as you're building a business you're always going to have critics and you're always going to have self-doubt and you have a choice as an entrepreneur you can either show up and try and build something and deliver or you can go home and cave into the pressure and as an entrepreneur you have to have some sort of reckless abandon where you're going to force yourself to pursue through the discomfort and build something that you believe in and that's what makes you a true entrepreneur so if i were to leave you with anything it's don't wait for the right time or the right idea the right validation on your product just go and build something today because you never know where it's going to take you it could bring you to a stage like this in san francisco in a place where you've never been before with 400 brand new friends so thank you guys you

so are we all ready to get started so our first speaker is Jess Lee she's the CEO and co-founder Polyvore which is a global community that helps people discover and shop for things they love in fashion beauty and home decor Justus here to talk about how Polyvore has grown to a community of 20 million monthly users by building a very delighted community of building a community of delighted users so please let's give a warm welcome to Jess Lee hi everyone who here is starting their own company or has their own company or is interested all right great welcome to the long road it's really really rewarding and really really hard one of the hardest things you're gonna have to do is figure out how to grow users so Polyvore is a community site so I wanted to talk a little bit today about community hacks how to grow a community so just before I get started real quick I'm Jess and the CEO and co-founder of Polyvore my story is a little bit unusual because I started as the product manager actually I started as a user of Polyvore who was really in love with the product and I wrote a note to the co-founders with some suggestions on how to make the product better then they hired me and after a couple of years we were all working together they said you know what we we think of you as a co-founder I'm just gonna start calling you an honorary co-founder and then eventually I became CEO so it's a pretty unusual journey you might say I'm a hustler and prior to that I was a product manager at Google Maps and then I studied computer science before that I loved manga drawing and bacon I was at Comic Con last week and if you want to follow me on Twitter I'm just Jessica or you can check out my blog at Jesse o cocom so for those of you who don't know Polyvore we're a new way to discover and shop for things that you love in fashion home decor and beauty so what our users do is they mix and match their favorite products real products into collages that we call sets and million what about 20 million people come to polymorph to browse and shop those looks we have about 20 million visitors per month we're the second largest driver of social commerce traffic the web so first is Facebook then Polyvore then Pinterest and then Twitter obviously we're much smaller in terms of user base and all those guys but we drive really high quality traffic that actually converts to sale and we have a global community of users who create about 4 million pieces of content per month that's 4 million of these beautiful collages so that's a lot of content a very active user community so the topic for today is a little bit about growth hacking but not the usual type of growth hacking that most people talk about the viral loops the email retention programs but really about what we believe is that the best way to grow is actually to cultivate a really delighted community of users so why this matters so much is because when you have people who are really delighted who love your product are your advocates what happens is they can't help but tell their friends about it and what happens is you get this natural word-of-mouth so it's very viral and that leads to viral growth I want to give a couple of examples of how this has helped Polyvore traffic growth so so much of our traffic in the early days came from blogs and what would happen is someone would use Polyvore and find the experience interesting and unique and hadn't seen it before so then they'd write a blog post like hey check out this site and that in turn would drive all of their readers and their followers back to Polyvore nowadays that's happening on Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest or tumblr but this has been part of it it's a huge part of our traffic growth over the years so that's one way that delight is really led to growth the other interesting thing is it's also led to fundraising growth or funding so one of our investors actually called me while we were in the middle of raising our Series C and he said hey I'd like to invest and I was like great would you like to do you know do you want me to come over to your office and do you know the pitch show you the numbers he said no I don't need I don't need to hear it I I'm in and I was like oh that's that's great why you know and he said well I heard about you three times in a very short period of time and that's why I'm in and so the three examples were his assistant uses Polyvore and told him about it his best friend who happens to be the CEO of a major fashion brand mentioned it to him at dinner in Paris and then the third was at his one of his old colleagues who is in an exec at an investment bank mentioned it to him at a conference in Vegas so three sort of mentions all over the world from people he knew he picked up the phone and called so that delight where you have someone just dropping your name in a positive way can really it can really lead to in this case million dollars worth of funding so it's really really important so I'm just gonna talk through some of the community hacks they fall under three principles the first their live learn and love and I'll go through each of them and then talk a little bit about what we do so live is that what this really means is that community starts from within so before you start thinking about how to go externally and do growth hacking and get your community first you have to really believe in the power of your user community you have to truly care about it your because if you don't it'll end up showing so your social media manager if they don't really love and respect your user community then they might tweet something and use it the wrong tone of voice if your engineers don't really care about the users and respect them they might build a feature that disrespects their privacy so it's really really important that you start first internally inside your company and figure out how to make sure that everybody cares so the ways that we do this first you have to make it part of your culture so Polly wears three core values delight the user do a few things well and make an impact the first one is basically about the user we want to delight the user so that's baked into the core values the second is that we actually make everyone at Polyvore go through a orientation where they sit down with the community team the community walks them through and talks of how much we love the community and how much you know the profiles interesting members so that's a picture of our orientation so you have to really start baking it into your culture very early on then a little nother thing to make sure the communities all surrounds your team is we decorate the office with community memorabilia love letters that they send us we post them on the wall we decorate the office with the beautiful collages the sets that our community makes when we get flowers or nice notes handwritten notes from our community we pass them around desk to desk in the office so everyone can read the the read the love letter we do a weekly email update so the community team actually writes up things like what you should know the top community requests a love letter each week and the spotlight on a members who get a sense of like who are these people who's behind you know the the user ID number that the engineers see we also at some point once your team is a little bit larger I would definitely recommend hiring a community team I think our community manager was the sixth higher at Polyvore so that's actually fairly early on but we wanted someone dedicated to this the community team does a combination of customer support as well as top member outreach a lot of companies only do the first part the customer support and they forget about how do you like make sure you have a strong relationship with your top members who are advocates so the second principle is learned you want to learn a lot from your community it's so valuable to have those users and to get their input back into your product is really important you have to listen to them you have to incorporate their feedback into your product and then you have to let them know that you incorporated their feet feedback into the product so one thing we do is we try to get feedback quite early we might do a beta test with a select group of members where they get access to a feature early or we might do something even earlier than that where we'll build a prototype for apps we really like this this tool called Flint Oh your designers can make mocks and wire them up and you can basically click have a click through prototype that looks fairly polished this is Jason one of our product managers holding Starbucks cards so you can give little you know little prizes little gifts to people to help out thanks for helping out but what we do is we we get this feedback early and then incorporate it into the development process recently I think we had a whole bunch of our engineers and our product manager and our our designers go gorilla style into Stanford mall and just ask people to look at things and we got a lot of really good feedback that was incorporated directly into the product in the next revision then once you're ready and you have your feature all designed it's really really important how you roll it out so you have to write a really good launch announcement do this on our blog generally and this is an example and I think the most important thing is to explain why you've done something most companies just say here is what we've built love it you should really see this is why you should love it here's what we did especially in particular if you're making large changes it's gonna be the case where you you discover something confusing about your interface you discover that you want to change something and people tend to have change of version so how many of you remember when the Facebook newsfeed first rolled out or the wall everybody hated it right they were like petition saying I hate this and now it's just such a normal part of Facebook like you can't even imagine what what it was like when there wasn't a wall or a newsfeed but everyone hated it in the beginning and that's because of change aversion so in anticipation of that especially once your products a little bit more established and you have those top members it's really important how you announce the features so this is a post that is from earlier this week we recently redesigned our iPhone app so we changed from a horizontal scrolling model swipe left to right to a up-and-down scrolling model and you know it we think it's a better design we tested it we found that the stats were better but we knew that the community might be upset that we changed it so we wanted to really explain why so this is the post that we wrote we said the reason we've done this is to make it more fun and easy to find and browse what you love we got feedback that it was confusing and that's why we've changed it changed it and we mentioned that we did actually beta test it with people and their feedback was positive so those little little inclusions of information make a big difference to your community then what we also do is we listen carefully to the feedback we actually create a Google Doc and we collect all that all the feedback so our social media manager will you know put tweets that she's received into this doc will collect all the comments off of our blog people will sometimes comment on sets that our team has made with feedback and put that all together and then we tally up the top requests and then it gives us you know a little bit of quantitative data and qualitative comments from our users telling us what they like or don't like so this is an example of the feedback that we got from the beta test of that visual design change that I showed you in the previous slide and it was overall quite positive but you can see that they're a bunch of negative comments and we went and tried to address as many of those as possible while you know you can't respond to every little community thing you can't you can't do exactly what your users tell you to do but it was good to see the feedback to validate or invalidate some of our hypotheses then once you've figured out what you're going to do what you're going to change it's really important to respond back to the community with updates so this is from a while back we we changed our messaging system inside of the Paulo in side of Polyvore and we we got some complaints about the new interactions and then we figured out how we should fix these specific things and you can see there are three updates update one two three or we actually wrote back to commute saying hey thanks for the feedback we're gonna working on fixing some of this stuff then hey we've made some changes let us know you think and then last seatt we're working on more changes and that dialogue really shows your community that it's it's a two-way conversation it makes you sound human it shows that you're listening and it makes a really big difference also when there are problems you need to address them head-on don't try to bury them so this is a from this is from I think yesterday there was a user who wrote in to complain about our Android app and it's because our Android app asks for a bunch of permissions and she's like why do i why you need all these permissions and our social media managers wrote back and said hey you know we're sorry you know it does seem confusing and unnecessary but the reason for it is Google has actually grouped some of this stuff under these terms and we need into these buckets and we need some of the details in there and hey we're not gonna prank call you don't worry and I thought this is a really nice way to handle it with a sort of fun human tone like we're having a conversation with a real person sometimes you'll screw things up you'll launch it was one time we launched all of our a/b test experiments all at the same time everything was turned on and was such a confusing because we immediately turned it off but people people were really upset they're like why did you change everything all of a sudden so or when there are outages when the site goes down for a little bit you know we just say sorry we're really really sorry here's what we know about when it's gonna be fixed everyone's working really hard on it we worked through the night those little bits of communication make a big difference and also when great things happen to you like we want a webby award this year we make sure to go back and tell the community about it and thank them because without them we would really be nothing the last principle is love you should really make sure you can you notice how much you care by how much you love and appreciate them so one easy thing to do as especially as you're starting out when you don't have a lot of budget to you know to share and give to your users what you can do is just interview your top members spotlight them highlight them in your social media tweeted them on your on Twitter what we do is we interview our members and we'll ask them you know what's trending in your neighborhood in terms of fashion tell us a little bit about you and why you use the product and will write interviews make content about them and then feature them on across our homepage in the app in our social media and our Facebook page then maybe once you have a little bit more budget to work with because you're starting to you know you maybe you got funding maybe you do it out of your own pocket cuz you care maybe you can partner with advertisers to do something one thing that we've done is send gifts small gifts that are personalized and then most importantly handwritten thank-you notes I can't tell you how many times we've you know we've done a meet-up and we've given them gifts and then there's a little note and they're you know there's all these presents and the thing they're most excited about is that we took the time to write a handwritten note you people just don't write letters anymore or notes anymore so it's I think it is still something that's kind of special and we will sometimes pass them around the office and have lots of people sign them and it's just an easy thing to do so why not do it it does make a big difference to people and then our community managers sometimes go out of the way to do personalized gifts so this one time that picture on the left is some of our users having received this box where they open it and they find an item that they've used in their Polyvore sets before that our commune managers have dug through their sets and they then they discover that my gift is different from yours and I use this in four sets and it was they were so happy there were people crying it's just it's just that little bit of extra when you go the extra mile that people will remember that and once we got even we got a little bit more funding we're able to do this we wanted to help the community actually achieve their career goals and their dreams in their aspiration so we asked them hey who in the community is actually interested in a job in the fashion industry what are your aspirations what do you want to do so we put out we did like a survey we got all this feedback and then from there we were able to figure out how to use our connections as a company and our personal network to make some of that happen so Samara on the Left we were able to set her up with an internship at Cynthia Rowley a fashion designer in the middle we sent a bunch of people to fashion shows to do community to be our community correspondents so we sometimes get tickets to shows to cover them but we you know we're here we're mostly engineers so we sent our community members to the shows and have them create content about them the third example is that's Olivia Lopez she's an amazing blogger and Polyvore user and we got we partnered her with a designer to create her own design collaboration for they design that shoe that she's wearing they called it the Olivia boot and it was on sale and it sold out so that was something that she got to do so we definitely try to make sure that our community is really really happy so those are the three principles live community starts from within learn learn from the community feedback that you get and incorporate into your product and love show them how much you love and appreciate them and when you do these things right you will see growth and you will see these kinds of comments from your commute so I'm just gonna read this this is from Heather she's been a member of Paul on Polyvore for probably six years and she said as long as I've been a member of Polly board the team has always been attentive and kept the community their number one priority I always assumed that as Polly board grew the genuine concern for user satisfaction would take a backseat to company goals fortunately I was wrong I'm continually amazed at how much of a family atmosphere Polly Ward's able to create all over the world I'm so thankful to be part of this community and I sing praises for Polyvore every chance I get so I do really when I look back on the history of polymer and how we've gotten to this point with the 20 million users I do really feel that this and the way that our community management team treats our community has been a big part of our success so I just wanted to share those growth hacking tips you guys thank you I'll actually start with a question yes hi big fan of your work we went to college together crashing in her house right Thank You Jess you've done a great job in cultivating the Maven community you know getting your top users to get together meet in person you know get them excited about Polyvore show how much that you guys love them back and I was wondering you know what are your thoughts in terms of extending that relationship a bit further in terms of you know when you guys have a huge release you know leveraging those bloggers to talk about it or seeping it with them first is that something that you guys actively pursue or how do you view that relationship yeah so we we definitely think about that when we have a bigger release what we like to do is have a beta test group where they get early access we you know you're invited to a special sneak peak of this new feature this new app that we're working on we'd love your feedback it's still a work in progress you know your your feedback means a lot to us and will help us make the product better so you phrase it that way so that they don't get pissed when they see all the bugs because early right and then you actually do incorporate their feedback and make sure that group in particular you respond to their emails and say hey thanks for that or oh sorry that was a bug so then they feel like part of this you know they feel like they're really contributing because they really are and then when the feature is ready to go you can email them again and let them know that to tell their friends as well as what we've also seen happen is because of change aversion sometimes the rest of the community who hasn't seen it before will be like oh I hate this like why did you change this I liked it the way it was before and then those people who were in the beta test sometimes they come out of the woodwork and be and comment back for you on your behalf and say hey I thought it sucked at first too but then I played for it for played with it for a week and now I love it and that is much much more powerful than you saying hey just wait a week and you'll love it too it's better when the community comes out and says that for you yeah so I think that's a big part of our release strategy thank you first question hi I'm Susan I am the head of community for a community oriented health care social media company and we have a same sort of situation a really strong community of really big fans and then a couple of outliers that are still part of our community better maybe a little bit higher maintenance and I was wondering if you have some insight into how you've trained your team to handle those kinds of folks within the community and sort of when to draw the line on engagement and when to pull back and how you handle just those people that need a little bit of extra attention and maybe aren't necessarily 100% negative but are really challenging in their own way I think we've been lucky to have not a lot of people who are super challenging like we do have occasional incidents where someone's really angry about something and I think we we sometimes send them flowers after we resolve the issue even then even with those challenging people I still think it's important to go that extra mile and then you do have to use your your your best judgment so I think we just tried to find a team that genuinely cared and just said hey treat them like you would treat a real just a real human right and then they've written internal guidelines for themselves on how to do that and it's fairly self-regulating
