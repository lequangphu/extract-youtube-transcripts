all right we have sheal today here who is by my call the most interesting man in Tech and that is a big claim and I'm aware of the power of my words but I did not [Music] stutter she I think I've told you this before but I think of all people I feel like you live in this beautiful blend of you you do things that make you successful but then you do a lot of things that just seem like a lot of fun and they're random and you're letting you know life kind of Bounce you in whatever Direction it's going to take you and it's kind of inspiring and Sam I know it's inspiring for you cuz Sam is a perfect square and he just likes to be a perfect square and he doesn't know what to do with this crazy blob shape like you Sam is that right yeah I mean he's inspiring to me like he just does the silliest stuff but let's just say so Sheil here's like I'll brag on your behalf so basically you have what a three $20 million VC fund you've built a business called thisle to 100 million in revenue and you've built another business that sold domains I think you've sold half a billion dollar in domains you've done all this amazing stuff but then you do like the silliest things like you did like an online version of The Bachelor you you in a Justin Bieber music video like you do ridiculous stuff got married sponsored by Taco Bell in the metaverse he had a wedding in the metaverse with Taco Bell somehow I don't don't even know what that is I didn't know about that that's awesome what was that oh it's a long story but yeah Taco Bell sponsoring by wedding we had a series I figured like if you're gonna have a wedding um it's a great excuse to bring your friends together and so I was like and it's it's an excuse for all your friends to come together as as many times you do it they're all going to come so we had six weddings and nine wedding related events over the course of a year one of which was sponsored by Taco Bell because we entered a contest and my amazing wife let me do this yeah makes sense I don't even know what to make of all this makes sense what up YouTube Sean here um you guys know that I have started a newsletter company and sold it Sam has done it too Sam built the hustle got it to millions of subscribers sold it to HubSpot I built a company called the milk Road as a crypto newsletter and sold it for millions of dollars one year later and we've both had success with this newsletter business model so the team at HubSpot got together and they did a research project called the future of newsletters and they're trying to put together some research around where they see opportunities for the newsletter industry um what are some of the you know sort of checklists some things you should pay attention to when it comes to newsletters and a bunch of other data and research that they're packaging together if you want to check out what the HubSpot team has put together go to the link below this video and um and download it it's free and you can check it out and you can learn something about newsletters I went back and I listened because you've been on the podcast way back when I first started it because you were a friend of mine in San Francisco and I wanted to have interesting people on the podcast so back in 2019 you're probably in the first 20 episodes and I actually went back and listen to it this morning because I forgot all of it I I don't remember any of this so I'm going to repeat a couple of the stories I actually want to start you brought some ideas opportunities you see things like that I want to get to those but I want to start with maybe the relatable side hustle can you talk about one of the way one of the early ways you made money which was this story about the iPod Mini I don't even know if you remember the full full story here but uh can you tell this iPod mini hustle story yeah I was like a new graduate college graduate I was working a job they gave me an iPod mini which is um the iPod had come out it was white and then the mini came out it was smaller and it was available in four colors uh blue yellow pink and green and right after I got it my headphones got stuck in a bike I was riding and broke and apple was not selling those headphones like those iconic headphones that I wanted Apple wasn't selling them so so I had this idea of like let me make these headphones and I'll make them in in the colors matching the iPod mini and so I went to China for the first time in my life just to like figure this out and I like you went for this reason I went for this reason yeah I I just I was working a full-time job I took a two-e vacation and I was like let me spend those two weeks in China and I like where in China China's a big place you were just like I'm just going to go I'll find a guy what what was the plan okay so I I went to Hong Kong actually originally like I looked up trade shows there was this big consumer electronics trade show so I was like I'm just GNA go to this trade show and then I'll figure it out and I hadn't booked anything else so like I went to this trade show there were thousands of boots and so like I just went around having no idea about anything just like went to these boots found ones that made headphones their English was very poor I have my Chinese is negl so it was a lot of like they pull out a calculator and I'm like this is what I want and then like I had some sketch drawing that I had made of what I was looking for and then they are like entering a number into a calculator they're like that's you know $5 and I'm like no no no no no that's like 83 cents and then I actually went and visited their factories in like Southern China guano and Shenzhen and it was awesome like it was a really way for me to get into business how much time passed between your headphone breaking and you're like oh I should sell headphones and I'm in China uh I think it was like a couple months so you you have a job you decide to go you're you're like I'm just going to kind of fund this off my savings or did you place the initial was a big initial order what how did you do it uh the initial order it was cheap it was you know 10,000 headphones and I think yeah I mean for me at the time it was a lot of money like it was my first job um but I think it was like a total outlay of $220,000 gotcha so do you you make these headphones which by the way seems like an insane oversight by Apple to not sell the headphones um like you're saying they were iconic at the time and you have to Market these how are you going to sell like a TH or 10,000 pairs of headphones so there like now there's a very A playbook quantitative marketing all this stuff at that time on the internet there wasn't a Playbook to follow so I started out like going after blogs there were a lot of blogs when I was like I'll give you a giveaway for your for your readers uh that was that was one technique and then one that was pretty awesome is Facebook had just come out and at this time Facebook was limited to college campuses and the way that they monetized Facebook at that time was you could set up a flyer so like I went to cig melon I could pay a day to have the sidebar Carnegie melon and it was basically for like a flyer like if I was throwing a party I could advertise on Facebook and so what I did was I went back to my high school friends who went to the biggest colleges so like University of Michigan Ohio State like those Penn State those kind of colleges where they had like 30 or 40,000 students and I said give me your Facebook ID um and they gave me their Facebook login I paid them something and I was able to Market to those audiences for still $10 a day like you want the biggest audience you can for that $10 a day and so we we did in Michigan we did like the colors of Michigan like blue and yellow stuff like that um it was a cool it was a cool little business dud that's a that's amazing that Facebook used to let you do that just to like Market to your whole campus for 10 bucks a day is insane how much did it end up making yeah so um how much money did it make I want to say net was probably like $80,000 do you plan any anything so like one of the parts of this episode is that like you're pretty spontaneous and but but but you have uh you know $300 million fund you have $100 million your company who knows what that's worth but at least probably a $100 million so like pretty like epic success but you also do really random things spur the moment type of decision- making yeah I just like I I think I've always chosen like the more adventurous path I would say and then I think something I get my grandfather my my mom's dad was like he was just always bored and always coming up with new ideas he would at the time it was different he would like read about something in the newspaper and be like I should start something so like in India when TVs were coming out like growing up like there's only like one TV station and then expanded from there and he was like oh TVs are going to be big and he started a TV Manufacturing Company knowing nothing about anything like he just was like I'll just learn how to make TVs and then he set up a Manufacturing Company it was hard to get us a phone in India so he created this like pay phone company that allowed people to just use payones and like he would just read about something in the newspaper and like me as a kid he would actually like mail me like clips from the newspaper and he'd be like should we start this company together I'm like 15 years old and he's like giving me an idea and he had some good ones um one of the ones I remember like I she just took this up recently he passed away many years ago but he had this idea for like he looked up ancestry.com great business and he was like in India people love their ancestry why don't we start one for India and that was an idea he had for me a good idea wow did anybody do that by the way is there now an ancest I actually don't know it's a good still for gra still probably a good idea for my my grandfather who now passed away many years ago yeah that's wild Sam on the first episode he did he talked about the domain business it's kind of a longer story so we probably won't do it again but uh the the the short version of it is you were selling uh you were not selling you were the auction Auctioneer for people who wanted to buy new domain like uh uh top level domains so like photoa blog whatever and so Amazon and Google and Rich guys would come and they would try to bid and you guys were the the auction to do that You' take 4% of the auction you sold like I don't know $500 million worth of top level domains but one of the things he talks about he's like yeah so my co-founder was this expert in auction Theory and I met him on a train in India and he just he just had these little things he threw out like yeah I was just happened to be on a train in India met this guy ended up starting a company with him was he an American in India or an Indian he's German in India that's ridiculous what year was that I met him in 2006 when dares came on the podcast dares the founder of hubot he yeah we talked about um the Steve Jobs speech that he gave at Sanford that's pretty famous a lot of people know it now he talks about like you can't you can't connect the dots you know looking forward you can only connect the dots of your life looking backwards and the famous example is he talks about like how he used to love studying calligraphy and fonts and he got really into that he took courses on it and then only later when he started Apple Computers he made sure that the first set of Apple Computers had these like beautiful fonts and no other computer company cared about that but he did he connected those two dots his passion for x and his passion for y and they both came together and um dares pointed out he's like you know I think a lot of people look at that and they just sort of shrug like well I guess I just can't connect the dots like you know so don't even try he's like no what that means is your job is to be a DOT collector and you yeah the dots will connect later but like you got to be a DOT collector and so when I say that like I guess like what are some examples for you of of dot collecting in your life where at the time you didn't really fully realize it but you chose more adventurous path or you followed your curiosity and then good things later ended up happening I think there's a lot of that um and I I love that idea of being a DOT collector um I think there's a lot of like just saying yes to stuff so one I'll just say I'll say yes to a lot of crazy ideas that people throw at me investing of course you have to be Discerning um when I'm investing other people's capital and and so for the fund I think we're we're very Discerning but uh for ideas for myself or like people invite me to speak at a conference in some random country lot V I've been to like lot V like all these countries that people don't go to um just because somebody invited me and I think that I've learn learned a lot by doing those things one of the crazier things I did is I lived in India on a dollar a day it's like a Mr Beast video yeah funny and I I did it for a year so like I moved to India I was 24 years old and I lived for one year on around a dollar a day and what do that get you in India is that like a like is that like a McDonald's value meal like I don't know the like the or yeah maybe like a McDonald's value meal per day and so I think like what I learned from that I think it was like supremely influential in my life and I learned one like I don't need a lot of money to be happy like I was so happy in that time and like I went from I was a Management Consultant in the United States like making a six figure salary and I moved to India on a dollar a day and I I real I I had a convertible here in India I had like a bicycle and and even the bicycle was like a big deal for me to buy uh and I just had so much fun and there there's this concept in India called jugad which is a a Hindi word it means like there's no perfect word for it it kind of means like creative problem solving and I think like I really learned a lot of creative problem solving during that year like just reusing things I learned like the importance of community resourcefulness spent $365 in one year that was it yeah does that include rent and what type of program is this um it the program no longer exists it was called indicor and it was like a volunteer program and part of it was like they want I wanted so I was working for Kaa a nonprofit uh micr Finance institution and I I wanted to live like my borrowers and so the people that we were lending money to were living on a dollar a day so I was like I'm going to do it too so did you just like have a midlife crisis when you're were 25 like did you do this in the first place what was the why okay yeah the why is kind of silly in hindsight but actually I watched a movie Hindi the movie called rang de bentti where they're like the India isn't just going to change you have to change it and I was thinking like I grew up in America but I have a lot of affinities to India I want to change India so I had this like lofty ambition and then I don't think I did anything for India like I did a lot for myself but I don't think I accomplished anything for India that's d i I was trying to convince Sean uh like three weeks ago I think we it was like live like don't spend any money for a week or something like way less significant than what you did and I got like a hard no a hard no I didn't watch that movie dude I I wasn't inspired in hindsight it was stupid like I got I got super sick I got typhoid and I well besides that could yeah besides that no overall it was an amazing experience and actually like I have so many so many of my close friends today are from that time there there's another good uh dot collector story I think for you you correct me if I'm wrong but I think you were one of the First Investors in flexport is that right yeah and but you didn't just like it wasn't just like a traditional VC move where somebody cold pitches you and then you write this check cuz you're like yeah I totally see the future of freight forwarding no it wasn't that there was some you did something you just said yes to something before that I don't know the story but I I I I know that it wasn't just a cold pitch that walked into your office and by the way just so we have context what's what's flexport Valu is now and what was it when you invested like how big of a of a deal is this yeah so um I actually don't know the most recent but it's in the several billions of dollars and when I invested it was a $10 million valuation um something like 10 million to three billion let's call it yeah um and I sold some of my shares uh and the ones that I sold it was more than 100x return wow okay all right go ahead sorry and um okay so flexport uh it's a digital Freight forwarding company is one way to think about it if you have a bunch of stuff in China and need to get it here there's a bunch of steps required in between and they'll help you do those steps like you wanted your iPhone your your iPod mini uh headphones to get here they got to get onto a container get onto a boat get from the boat to the Port Port to the truck truck to your Warehouse how does all that happen go through customs all this other stuff exactly exactly and so it just made sense to me that this needed to be digital it's a real pain in the ass if you if you don't use flexport or something like it um and so I met Ryan at a party and we bonded over some really funny things which were um he I think he's a really hacky guy like he just figures stuff out he started the company by himself uh non-technical like outsourced team originally and then eventually built he built up a lot of stuff internally but um we were buying Uber credits in our name so I did that you did that too was it was your guy in India no no no we we were like I was advertising Google AdWords for my referral code and at times at that time I would buy free rides from this guy in India oh who was probably doing what we're doing yeah exactly yeah yeah yeah like I would buy like $1,000 of Uber credit for like $100 or something like that okay so we we were effectively doing the same thing like just advertising for our name and we kind of bonded over that and became friends and then what he what he had he had done some previous businesses in the import export space and so I was like dude whatever you whatever you start I'm gonna be investing in it and and it obviously turned out great that's amazing what isn't it crazy by the way how like so you know I don't know what Ryan's worth but like you know if you have a multi-billion dollar company you're in the vicinity of hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars of net worth so you're like it's like you're a big shot and just eight years prior you're selling Uber credit like like and that's a pretty common story I think for sure for sure Silicon Valley it's like so many people that you meet I I guess like I I've lived in San Francisco for 12 years now and this is like a common story there's a bunch of people I met early on who were just like hustling and then eventually started something that became big that's so funny um Sean that's actually like you talked about the surface area like all the dot collecting I think part of it is being in San Francisco like I moved here in 2012 and there were just a lot of interesting things happening like if you were out meeting people you met people doing interesting things the way you're saying you live is different than what you probably advise the companies who you invest in to live just like saying yes to a variety of things which like if I wanted to like paint this in a bad way I'd be like well you're ad and you can't focus and like you're you're missing out on like year 8 9 10 and year 20 where all like a lot of the compounding like growth comes from um how do you balance like those two things of being focused which is like what every VC will ever tell a Founder versus saying yes to speaking in lapia or going to China to start a new head company it's it's such a good question and I I think the way I think about it is I'm probably more of your zero to one guy than I am you're like one to 100 and so like I've started a lot of things and then mostly found other people to actually run them over time and like some of the things I started got to exit and and and were successful but if you want to have like huge success multi-billion dollar companies which is like what we're hopefully investing in you need to be really focused and so I would not invest in most of the companies that I would start like if I if I were running a VC fund these companies aren't VC fun VC type opportunities what's the story of thistle cuz I remember we went out to dinner once many years ago and you were like you started this like you helped start I don't know what your role was but you helped start some local food delivery business and at the time there was just a bunch of them going out of business sprig was going out of business and it was like it was like looked like a blood bath and you were like no we're kind of approaching it like not the Venture funded way I started ordering from it I started eating it all the time I love thisle and and Sam just said it's now 100 million a year business what is can you tell what is the origin of this this business yeah so the origin is myself and my roommate in San Francisco at the time we were we felt like we were just like making unhealthy choices and like eating the fastest thing possible to get back to work or whatever and the idea was like what if there was healthy food in your fridge already you would just that would be the most healthy thing you could eat and and most convenient thing you could eat and at the time time as you said there were these companies sprig mun spoon rocket were were the most popular ones in the Bay area where you could order and for like 10 or 15 bucks in 20 minutes or even 10 minutes food would show up at your door and we were like should we invest in these companies should we start one of these companies I ended up driving for sprig I was like let me sign up to be a driver there he goes again that is so funny it it yeah and for those people who don't know spr get started by all of our friend gagan and it was one of the innovators before door or I think before door Das there as like due diligence yeah I like signed up to be a driver and to like d yeah diligence and I was like okay so there are a bunch of problems with this model I don't know if this is going to be a massive business and the problems are one they're wasting a ton of food like you cannot predict how much food you need on any given day and they were like yeah we have this Aon model like we're going to um predict if there's a Giants game it's this if this it's actually like kind of impossible to predict so wasting like a third of Their Food Drivers all are driving at the same time it's like lunchtime or dinner time that's when it's all happening and then routes aren't optimized so like you're kind of driving one place then you go and you have to go somewhere else across the city so we were like can we solve this and so we set out to solve it and the idea was a subscription service and the idea was you have to order by Friday your meals for the week and there are people like it doesn't work for me like I'm I might be I don't know what I'm doing tonight for dinner but like somebody might invite me to something I'll go but a lot of people are more structured in life and the idea was for those people we can give them a meal plan and it's kind of like a like a private Chef might be and um do it at an affordable price point and it's been great like the business is awesome this. Co if you're on the East Coast or West Coast you can check it out is it bootstrapped or do you guys ra raise funding we did ultimately raise funding and we've raised a few rounds of funding but not that much money over time but it's going to be it's a good outcome for you personally yeah it should be um you know look I think food businesses are tough low multiple businesses and so I don't know what it's going to be I haven't like you know I haven't like assigned any value to that Equity but hopefully it's going to turn is it still just in San Francisco I remember at one point you had said it was like doing 20 million a year in just San Francisco is it did it Branch out into like 100 other cities now or what so yeah so it's all along the west coast and the Northeast as well yeah I see it out where I live I live out uh right outside of New York and I and I see do I see Billboards uh you might see Billboards you see a lot of bags one one kind kind of like fun thing is a lot of celebrities use them and um you'll see like videos of celebrities on the internet like carrying the thistle bag which is kind of cool like this Mega famous person is carrying something that I help create you know you sent us a list of like four five six ideas and interestingly Sean a few of them are in your wheelhouse involving schools a few of them are in a thing or two that I know about and I think it'd be interesting since you see so many ideas with the fund and you've been well connected in Silicon Valley for I don't know 20 years now if you could list out some of the interesting opportunities that you're kind of seeing I have some that are like maybe Venture scale ideas and then a lot most of them my ideas are not Venture scale but I can talk about a few of them one is I just got back from Florida my parents uh moved to Florida they moved to a Indian retirement community and it's called shantian and it's not that well executed but the idea is Indians they like this guy created a huge plot where he put up like a hundred homes and then there's a community center where they have Indian food they have like movie Nights stuff like that it's really fun for old for Indian people for Indian retirees you have to be Indian to go or is it just like everyone who lives there is Indian yeah but like can I go and join yeah you can go check it out anytime yeah eat the food and so the idea it's a good idea but it's not that well executed and i' I've just been thinking like there are a lot of retirement communities out there and most of them are aligned to a single Affinity which is Golf and so like most retirement communities are built around golf which is great for people who love golf but there's so many other affinities out there that should have their own retirement community and you know people are living longer than they did so like people are still retiring at 65 but they have like not only are they living longer they're living longer healthier lives so like my parents are still like relatively healthy I expect them to live another 20 30 years and you can build these communities where people like do whatever their Affinity is and so I think there's an opportunity here in building and like building a road map for an affinity and then like stamping it for other affinities over time Sean don't you know someone in the in the in this yeah yeah so I've looked at this because I found it fascinating uh for the same reasons that that she she was saying well first they're good businesses right because you're basically taking raw land and then you're like you just do the math you're like okay cool we're going to sell let's call it 50 plots or 75 plots or 100 plots and the numbers get pretty big pretty fast when you're buying these at you know a raw State and you're able to sell them but they also one of the things that some of them are doing is they blend together the like different Health spans so for example you can start there when you're just retired but then you need some assistance and then there's like an assisted area and then there's like you need a lot of assistance and then you're at the kind of like the the the full full service uh model but you don't have to move you don't have to like move very far right you're just like still there yeah you're still in the same Community you don't have to like you know do this like big cross country move it's not the scary you just sort of as your body you know goes down that gradient you just sort of move down a different level of service in the community and so that's super profitable when you do that and the LTV of the customers I mean imagine right you're 20 30 years in one of these communities it's really high and I know it because my parents kind of had the same reaction that sh's parents had which is yeah that I mean that'd be great I don't play golf but if there was a place that had the food we like with people that we get along with that speak the language you know that we have have the same cultural values and I was like well that's going to exist for every every race but also not just race like what are other things that people Bond over or is like the central pillar of their life and how do you build communities around that that see just seems very lucrative to me totally for this for the one my parents did there was a waiting list so my parents prepaid they put 100% of the money down and didn't get the home for five years and on these things that you when I think of an old home I think of like uh like a hospital looking Center where but these are like a plot of land where you buy a house yeah they bought a townhouse got it and you pay like a monthly fee yeah you pay monthly fee you get food um which is you know for Indian people especially I think a really big deal and then they have like they have a bunch of community events like they they play like cards they there's a community center they play they have movies Indian movies going on they have concerts actually I talked about our weddings my parents one one of the events that they had was a a Showcase of all of our wedding videos and then like I called in like we called it and in q& that's hilarious yeah because I feel like you know this is like the country club model but it's just for what what else is there besides a bougie Country Club like what are the other ways that people could get together in a clubhouse and have uh you know that that that would add a lot to their lives because it's pretty lonely if you're older you're living somewhere you don't know other people and the effort it would take to make new friends or drive to places just for certain events versus having it almost like Resort style for you it just makes a lot of sense and we have a friend who came on the Pod Craig Fuller who did this with uh Airline or um uh flying enthusiasts so basically he bought a plot of land he developed homes on it he pre-sold a bunch of them and basically the center of the property is instead of a golf course it's an airplane hanger so you're if you own like a Cessna or something like that you could keep it there and you could live there so you know it's like I want to go fly this morning I'm just going to walk out like a runway in the middle of the neighborhood basically that's so cool yeah so I think you can do this for a bunch of different affinities like I've talked to my Chinese friends and like their parents play a lot of maang and like there stuff like that that I think you could just build this around every Affinity over time so I think there's something there and I like these businesses that are high dollar value meaning you're not going to be able become a billionaire but you can make tens of millions of dollars doing this definitely and very high likelihood of success like you don't need like she'll told you the you don't need a stroke of Genius now any and like 50 people could go do this and they would all you know it's just a matter of execution at this point like if you just do do the basic things like with all these retire like the what do they call it the the silver tsunami like is there a is there a shortage of of space I think so I think like the reason my parents pre-bought it was they like they other Indian communities they couldn't get in like the prices had increased so much or they just wer there weren't availability so like they pre-bought into a new one so I think has to be a doctor it's actually a status symbol you you can't get into the community or just barred if your kid's not a doctor dude how much is a nursing home by the way should I be budgeting like I was uh like starts worrying about I'm worried about no I'm worried about it for my parents I was dude listen to this so are you going to put your parents in a nursing home I don't know like I Indians could never do that sometimes I think they like that don't they like they want I don't know I thought it was like enjoyable I don't [ __ ] know but so I was I was being with a like a financial adviser like three years ago and it was like 20 years in the future I was like what's that $250,000 a year uh spend and he was like oh you're going to have kids right I was like yeah but I'm not going to have triplets he was like well well you're going to have one kid and I assume that they're going to go to like a school that's in like the 85 percentile of cost and so in 20 years if you have have kids in two years it's going to be $250,000 a year and I was like dude don't make up this [ __ ] he goes I make it up I just took the trailing like 20 years of growth for like a Harvard or whatever 9 90 percentile cost school is and I just applied that for the next 20 years and that's just how I came up with it and I was like baffled that it's going to be I think it was maybe 150,000 years it was six figures and now that I'm realizing with old people homes or nursing homes I'm pretty sure that some of them are 10 and $20,000 a month today yeah that's right that's how much it costs which is in saying I guess uh so like what am I going to have to pay if my parents eventually want to do this you know is that are we talking like half a million dollars a year it's not that high uh but you know you can like there's a range so you can do a $3,000 a month bed you could do a $88,000 a month bed you could do 15,000 20,000 depending on if you want to go basically the risk C is 20,000 the fanciest I I don't there's no upper end to anything in life right you can spend an infinite amount of money if you if you decide to uh but I would say like you like nice places can be at $115,000 a month but also some of these are covered by Insurance some of these are not some of this out of pocket right there's a whole bunch of different factors I know that in also different cultures like I said shame on you just kind of joking but in Indian culture it kind of is like that like there's an expectation culturally that either the parents move in with you or they're going to have their own house and you're going to have inhome care for them so there's all these different ways that you could do care for elders it could be that they're in a uh you know a nursing home or a senior facility or could be that you're paying for somebody to come to their house every day and help them manage day-to-day life at their house which is obviously going to be a different cost um you know my grandparents for example they have their own house and they have basically Round the Clock somebody come like like a kind of a nurse that basically lives in their house that just helps them with everyday things to just function in their own home because that's what was comfortable for them that's cool I think for all those any any of those different types of things like being in the same place with the community makes sense because like your grandparents may not need that one person full-time they might but like other people might want a fractional one and it's so much easier if that person like lives in the community or like comes to the community and can serve many people at once and a bunch of people tried this for like young 20s something after college it's like an After College Community blah blah blah but this is way better because people are going to be in these for like 30 plus years exactly and they have money actually versus that 20-some yeah they might spend one or two years after after College doing this in a big city but then they're going to kind of graduate out of it so you're going to have this crazy churn all the time I like your model better all right what's another opportunity what's another idea you got go to this Yelp one okay so the idea is Yelp for Professional Services so and then I I I originally had this idea I think before Sam before Sam put out Sam's list but the idea is why is it so hard to know like which insurance brokers are good which lawyers which financial planners which accountants like how do I know who's good and is going to serve my needs and like there should be a site for that and it's easily monetizable so I can give you guys an update so Sean uh 10 or eight months ago I created this thing called samslist samslist stco um and it was like Yelp for accountants and um I just did it because I needed an accountant and I found an accountant by the way on the website so it worked um we it it's it hasn't like taken off this year it did $99,000 in revenue and a little bit of profit and we have someone who's working on it but what we're changing over is making it we're we're adding like a financial advisor category but I completely agree with you of like having these review sites for Professional Services is necessary everyone is begging Us by the way if anyone wants to go do this go for it everyone's begging us for Sam's list but for agencies um I don't know anything about agencies so I don't like I don't know anything about that space But that is one thing that people have been begging uh us for is to have an agency category but I think that's just cuz I have a lot of agency owners who follow me on Twitter No but I think if you look on Twitter like people are constantly posting like hey I need help with this can can anyone recommend an agency I I feel like like we have a website designer that I really like and I feel like once every couple weeks I'm recommending him to somebody and like there should be a place where you could just search and find like I'm looking for an agency I'm willing to spend X X to Y and you know it should be a site that that does everything and maybe Sam's list is it it's [ __ ] hard to pull these off by the way it's hard things easy here's why they're hard like what we found was like we had a lot of like Mom and popop accountants on the website and like you're basically imagine like so what Sean did with milk Road and what I did what I did with the hustle was we had advertisers but the ideal situation is you have advertisers who are spending tens or hundreds of thousands or once the hustle got to a certain size sometimes they're spending millions of dollars a year but when you're working with like a mama pop accountant I'm basically selling packages for like $500 and you're like the mob like knocking on the door like got my money you know what I mean and it like yeah you know like the client hasn't paid yet so I don't have the money yet but I promise I'll get it to you next week like it becomes a little bit of a game like that and so if you're going to do it the ideal situation is that you're doing it accountants are basically a lot of them are like mop and pop organizations it's a pretty bad uh group to sell to but like whatever organization or industry you want to do this for it has to be where they're already spending a lot of money and it's bigger companies who can write bigger checks otherwise you're just going to end up like Yelp have you guys ever known like the joke in San Francisco when we live there was Yelp is where you go to learn how to do sales because it's such a hard sales job and all they would hire anyone with a pulse and they would be like all right here's 40 Grand a year and then you get commission but if you hit your On Target earnings you're going to make 200 Grand a year you're going to be so rich and they find out that they're having to go like get an ice cream Stop Shop to give them like $900 wasn't it more like threats than sales even it was like oh this review is really hurting you wouldn't you don't you just wish that would go away yeah I might be able to make that go away I I never found any evidence of that actually happening though like people have been like provide me evidence and I don't think I don't think there's actual evidence of that happening there is with the Better Business Bureau by the way but but not with the El from what I can tell what where did that come from it came from business owners complaining about it who who else would put that story out there well so people have said like okay if there's any proof of Yelp saying pay me money and you'll get a better review or that review will get knocked out okay yeah send it to me and then nobody has ever sent it fair enough fair enough all right what what are the other what's this pearly whites one you got my attention Okay so this is my wife's idea there's something called a dry bar where you can just go get a blow dry of your hair it's like kind of like an In-N-Out thing 20 minutes and and you get your blow dry um my wife feels like she would like to get her teeth cleaned more than the twice a year that you're able to with a dentist on insurance and so the idea is you go to a place and all they do is clean your teeth they don't do any they don't do x-rays they don't do anything else you're in and out 20 minutes 100 bucks 120 bucks something like that and she would do that like every couple months and that's the idea so she likes getting her teeth cleaned she likes getting teeth cleaned with I I think it's weird like I don't but she does and I I could see people doing it like oh I'm going to an event like I'm gonna get my hair done I'm goingon to get my teeth done teeth cleaned well I like the unbundling of like the dental checkup right it's like what's the what is the one part that people kind of would want the most or need the most often that if you separate it out of your normal Dental kind ofy there might be just like a market for people who just want this I kind of buy that but I thought it would be teeth whitening not cleaning that's part of it also and and actually like you probably make more money in the whitening side but what you could do is actually like you standardize and like have a really nice looking space and dentists would franchise this and they'd be like Oh I'm a dentist I can open one of these you need to have dental hygienist and and a dent in some states you need to have a dentist there um but it doesn't have to be like they don't have to be doing the work they just have to be there right dude I went to my dentist and he had this sign but like it stood out because everything in the dentist office looked like a dentist office it just looked like Mom and Poppy and then there was one sign that looked really nice and this one sign was basically advertising kind of what you're describing it was like a 20 minute teeth whitening for like 85 bucks or whatever it was some some dollar amount and I was like what is this is this yours and he's like oh actually yeah there's like this company that made this service that then we can then sell to our customers and they provide like the marketing and the name of this and they're trying to popularize this but we just get incremental Revenue because we're able to upsell this essentially and I was like oh that's it's basically like the Hunt Brothers Pizza model what they did for gas stations they're like hey here's a here's a pizza shop inside your gas station somebody's doing this for dental offices where they're putting in this like Teeth Whitening upsell program and I was like it's kind of work I I get it it works cuz otherwise you know the dentist offers like you know 1,500 Services if you really wanted to you could go and ask them about what's it called I don't remember the name of this one but I I don't think it was I don't know how popular this is but I remember just thinking oh this makes sense I could see why it's a win for the dentist it's a win for this company and I could see why consumers would be when you're just sitting there trapped in the chair literally like strapped into the chair it's the first thing you see in front of you you stare at that thing for 15 minutes and you're looking at this before and after photo and you're like yeah cool add that on I'll take that I'll take the whites speaking of Hunt Brothers another idea and this is uh one of my best friends is doing this and I I invested but um it's called piz to Luna and the idea is when people go to hotels they most often order pizza like mid-range hotels people order pizza constantly dominoes coming in so the idea was what if we gave you the ability to sell a high quality pizza and originally it was like will'll give you the oven and the pizza that's like hand tossed made in Italy actually shipped over from Italy tastes amazing and uh and so a lot of hotels use pizza or Eola and then we have the table tents and all that other stuff dude this is a great idea it's just hunt hunt Brothers but for hotels and Italian is it working it's working yeah it's been pretty successful it's still fairly early but um it's it's doing really well and what's the hard part about this because like um you know the Hunt Brothers thing I think they started out doing wholesale ingredients so they already had like a ton of infrastructure in place where they were already selling you know do's and all that stuff to to you know pizza shops all around the place and that's why they were able to like just take the next logical step and create their own brand and then provide those same ingredients to the to the um the gas station owners is this really hard to spin up or was this actually like you know pretty doable I mean it it's complicated like my friend is on a plane to Italy all the time like he wanted to make sure it was like super high quality something the hotels felt really proud to offer but why I don't think I could tell if this pizza's from Italy that's see like like would my taste buds know the difference between Kentucky and he says it you're like yeah this is not cheap pizza it's not cheap pizza like Italy like is that you know how like um you know how like Florida has like Hollywood Florida like it's a small town yeah can we call it like you know is there like an Italy Kentucky Italy wisc yeah no it turns out like the the ingredients like it just does taste better like they know how to do it there it's actually it so what you're probably thinking is like isn't it expensive to bring it over here it's actually not it's kind of worth it and they have the experience in know how it's actually made like near Naples which is where pizza comes from dude my dad I remember when we were a kid he saw this pizza place and the sign just said hand tossed pizza and there was like a guy in the window tossing and my dad wouldn't shut up about the hand toss pizza for like you know a here and these things just work I don't know why there's something to it if it says world's greatest cup of coffee I buy it every single time oh totally that [ __ ] always works on me you guys know the the greay goose story no yeah the taller bottles the taller bottles but also so the so the guy who started greu started it by the way when he was in his like 70s he was like in he was like 70 years old and decided to start a startup was he successful so he all before that he had created um Jagermeister not created but he had brought jgermeister to the US us and made it popular so Like the Jagger Meister story was he's out one night all he was like part of the family alcohol business his wife's was his wife's parents business and then they get in a fight they kick him out and he's like all right [ __ ] this I got to do something and he's out one night he sees people he sees a German like group of friends sipping this like weird cough syrup looking thing and it was Jagermeister and it was like a after dinner type of thing and he's like what is that he inquires about it he figures it out and he decides I'm going to become the US importer of this thing called jgermeister but to make it popular what he did was he created the jger bomb and got like jerett the girls who would go around bars pouring the stuff down college kids throats and he made it the party drink so jger becomes this like big drink he's successful now he's in his 70s and he's like all right I'm G to start a new one I want to start a vodka company and he basically says I'm going to do two things differently first he goes we need to Source the vodka and they go great we're on our next out to Moscow and he goes no no no we're not doing Russian vodka they go what do you mean we're all like that's where vodka comes from he goes go to France and find me vodka they go there's no vodka in France he goes go to France and find me vodka because if I told you this is French vodka it just makes that dirty Russian vodka look like crap and so they're like but what if it's not better he goes I said it's French vodka that means it's better and so he sends one group there and he tells the other group he goes go go to the um bar right now and buy buy the most expensive vodka that there is bring all the bottles here and they bring all the bottles and he's basically like lines them all up and he goes cool whatever the what's the most expensive vodka I was like absolute at the time he's like cool uh we're going to be 30% more expensive than whatever the most expensive one is and um what that's their bottle okay it's this fat bottle we're going to be a tall bottle and then he got the he commissioned somebody to make it and they did the frosted glass and he's like that's it that looks expensive as hell and he created greay Goose off of this very simple concept it was like either Italian or French vodka put in this expensive tall frosted glass bottle it's so tall it wouldn't even fit on the shelves so you had to put it on the top shelf because if you put it on the middle shelf it wouldn't fit it was too tall so it had to become top shelf like vodka by by by default because it was so tall isn't that amazing that's hilarious that that's so funny it's interesting because it's basically like a commodity like it's all it's all pretty much the same it's hard for people to distinguish uh I have a friend who started a vodka brand um and the bottle cost more than the Vodka yeah exactly and it was like a premium brand dude it seems like a it seems like um like a horrible business to be in it seems like really challenging alcohol in particular is tough because of the regulatory environment it's different state by state what you can sell and you have to get licensed and all this stuff it is challenging oh um you want to do another one yeah what else you got what else you excited about she that you think somebody could go do I think something I want in my life is like a school for AI tools so like maybe you could franchise it um but for me like right now I would pay a few hundred bucks to go to a class like half a day just to become a better photographer iPhone photographer and like show me how to edit things and like make fun funny things on the internet memes or whatever same thing for video and I think the same is true for many other prods that you can use like AI or software for so it's like a software school um in person Kum V just for you like just other to other tools that are useful in your life exactly yeah is for adults or for kids it could be for adults I think start for start with adults and then also kids Sean he was telling me before this he was like H you know I'm trying to hire this person to teach me how to do like video editing and use Ai and I was like two things one Sean actually hired an AI like tutor which is actually pretty amazing and then also you went on this big rant a month ago it's probably the greatest in terms of like eek guy of like what the world wants what Sean's good at what he's passionate about and like what the world's willing to pay for like him creating like uh you know another full sale University it's quite aligned oh yeah I had this idea well first I did I did a AI tutor mostly just because I've realized that coaches are just an absolute life hack once you get some money it's like a luxury that doesn't actually cost that much but adds a lot of value to your life and so now anytime I want want to do something my first stop is who's a coach I can hire that will speed up my learning curve be a forcing function because they're going to show up and it's going to like force me to actually stick to this hobby um and yeah get better faster how do you find him uh with this I just tweeted it out and I was like hey who could I'm I'm willing to pay $500 an hour for somebody who's G to um you learn all the new stuff that's going on in Ai and then I want to sit with you for 90 minutes every Wednesday and I want you to um tell me what's going on but also like like teach like like I'm hands on keyboard struggling trying to do the thing because that way I'll like actually learn how to do it and um it's been kind of amazing to be honest you're still doing it uh we're still doing it kind of shifted a little bit like other friends wanted to join so I invited a couple other friends and so it's kind of a group thing now and um yeah it's pretty amazing so uh that's that's been great on the AI side but just in general I'm a big like I'm it's like it's I comical now how how my first answer to everything is to get a coach and um but whatever I'm going to keep doing it till it doesn't work and it's it's worked at everything dud we hired a we hired an organizational coach to come and teach us how to like organize a classet like I'm so on board with oh my God we pay so much to our organizer we don't have a coach we just have an organizer comes in and she is doing so well she re she last time she was here which was like two weeks ago because she here all the time organizing something um she was like oh my client from San Francisco is flying me I'm gonna go organize their new place in Switzerland so she's like got this thing going where like it's an incredible business I I mean it's not like a huge business but she's she's got people under her and stuff now is it just like magic like is your house just like incredible now I think it's fine my wife W I have a friend that just bought a home they moved in it's huge house like 8,000 sare ft they paid this service $25,000 to be there before like to map out where everything like it was like you know like starting from scratch to like be there to map it all out to buy the storage supplies and then to put the labels and to come up with the strategy it was 25 Grand uh that's a lot it's it's a lot I think we paid I I don't remember I don't know how much we paid total because I don't see it because if I saw it it would me crazy but I do remember the kitchen was a couple thousand do you do you have the like Indian uh frugality gene or are you like okay you're not a good spender I'm not a good spender and it's like my lifestyle hasn't changed that my net worth has increased quite dramatically over the past decade and my my lifestyle hasn't changed I'm always looking for a deal like anything I buy I'm going to slick deals first I've like got the credit card points thing down like all this stuff that shouldn't I shouldn't be doing is like stupid optimization but for me it's kind of a game and I love it what are the give us a quick credit card tip what do you what's your credit card stack because I don't want to do the research but I might just piggyback off you yeah yeah for sure okay so um I use the US bank smartly card it's 4% on everything and if you just want a single card that's the card to go off of us smartly that's what it is yeah yeah it's 4% at everything by the way I use it on my taxes so wait what I pay 1.82% to the government to use my credit card and then I get 4% back from US Bank it's just like I'm getting 2% back on my taxes I could use that for like Facebook ad spend I could use it for anything use a Facebook ad spend yeah exactly is there like a limit or is it unlimited just your credit limit um Wow's called it's called US Bank smartly and you have to have you have to have $100,000 with us bank but what I did is I just have a brokerage account with a single stock and that's my $100,000 at US Bank it's a great deal like they they're losing money on me for sure dude on one hand I'm like this is sick I gotta do this and then on the other hand I'm like he just like you know I don't know dude 4% is pretty legit I went through a lot of Hoops to get 2.6 from Bank of America America yeah and uh so now you're just [ __ ] on that this is this is way better this way better this is way better I also you also tweet types of stuff like the other day you're like does Robin Hood give like 4% interest so Robin Hood Robin Hood has a card that gives 3% cash back on everything and then right now they have a promo where it's like 4% or 5% it was 5% if you put $25,000 into a Robinhood brokerage dude it's kind of actually interesting because if you are a really big company or you're spending a lot couldn't the difference between 0% and 4% like have a meaningful impact on your margin absolutely yeah I mean if you're buying Facebook for like could be really massive for you yeah but for me even just my taxes getting 2% back on my taxes is you know many thousands of dollars pretty sweet that's crazy it's like free money I know a guy who um well I could say it actually his name's um David Hower he did a podcast so is public but he sold his company grasshopper for I think $125 million and he he's like you know famously he's he's a friend of mine he's like famously Frugal and like you know whatever and he was like convinced American Express to let him pay his tax bill which on a $100 million sale I I don't know what that would be 36 $40 million something and he was like I now have unlimited basically like unlimited flying like for the he's like for the next he's like for the next like 30 years I ball out on on flying and I don't have to pay for a thing uh and and and he paid with his you know $40 million tax bill on AMX the one thing so um speaking of miles so like one thing I don't want to do is accumulate a lot of miles I already have more miles than I need and like people are like oh well you're getting 4% but I'm actually getting five% because I get miles and miles are worth 2.3 cents to me because but and then I look into it and they're like how is it worth that much to you and you're you're like flying on some random time of the day on a business class flight but that's not the flight I want to take just give me cash back and I'll I'll I'll buy my own [ __ ] right also don't miles inflate at some like insane inflation rate plus you don't actually use all your so even in theory every point is worth X you're never going to use 100% of your points so you have to Discount back off that exactly so for me cash back is King dude I know a guy in Hampton by the way who ha who is a two-person company and he spends 10 million a year on Facebook ads or something and he's like I got all these miles and so I just I was like Hey book a flight for me and I'll just send you the money and I got you know I bought four first class tickets to Europe and I got probably a 30% discount because of it it was significant savings for me do you have any other good uh Financial wins or hacks so you got the 4% cash back card is there anything else that like is a needle mover actually I've started using Robin Hood for a lot of stuff so Robin Hood had this thing where and they they continue to have it where um that's dangerous I I don't think it's dangerous Robin is a big company they're they're making lots of money I I'm I'm I'm a Robin Hood Bull and they had this thing where you could move your assets over and they would match 1% set so it's pretty amazing if you have let's say $10 million of Assets in stocks somewhere you move it over you get $100,000 free money how long does it have to stay there I think it's two years but I've been very happy with the service and and I I I just did the transfer acast transfer from Schwab Schwab called me like red alert and they were like we'll give you $15,000 right now in your account you don't have to do anything you just we're just going to give you $15,000 you don't move your money and I was like yeah but I'm getting a lot more from from uh Robin Hood so I I moved it and I've been very happy and then I I have a lot of other I now use other products on them and they have a great margin rate it's like 5% it's great do you um are you like a stock picker what do you do with your personal portfolio are you just like boring index funds do you do anything interesting I want to not be a stock picker I want to be boring index funds but inevitably like I get excited about an idea and I invest in it and it's been very good for me I've like been fortunate to outperform the market pretty significantly what was your big best pick I bought uh like my biggest position was Nvidia in 2017 no [ __ ] and what was that based on what was the idea there it was um I I did a lot of research got excited and I thought there were two thesis like I actually it was more based on crypto than it was Ai and I was wrong like we we moved away from gpus and moved into A6 for for crypto but it ended up being right anyway and been awesome so that was in 2017 the stock uh was R it's about 30 30 something X from that yeah yeah yeah it looks like it's a 30X 150 today back then it was five bucks 30X is wild did you keep it in the whole time and it was yeah I've kept it the whole time I haven't actually bought any more or sold any um so yeah I I have and it was it was like my biggest position in 2017 and you're you're basically like a fintech expert right your fund is fintech you've invested a bunch of fintech things what's your position on crypto are you like yes are you a big Bitcoin bold do you believe in all the altcoins like what's your where do you stand because I haven't heard you talk about it much yeah I don't talk about that much I I um Bitcoin is so actually looking at my assets it's probably Bitcoin number one Nvidia number two and then like the house that I live in number three prob no way really yeah and so uh tell say more what got you into Bitcoin or crypto at the beginning and is it is it just Bitcoin or do you also believe in eth and salana and other things uh I only have Bitcoin and eth I have some of the others but like not a meaningful amount I actually have a tweet where I I was like like anti- Bitcoin and Bitcoin was like 60 cents or something I was like this is never going to work here's why governments were never going to allow it blah blah blah and then I finally bought in around $300 and the idea was I still like what people believed then what people told me was like it's going to be a fast and efficient way to to move money and that isn't what happened at all right and so in some ways I was right it doesn't it doesn't matter I was right I lost a lot of money by not doing it earlier and I think as a store of value like the more successful it gets the more successful it's going to get right and so that's it and more and more people are putting money in so I I've put money in now for me personally for my for me personally that makes sense for my fund I want to invest in things that like actual people are goingon to be able to use and like have real impact on the world and I haven't found that many use cases we have made a couple investments in stable coins I think there's something there yeah I was going to ask you nerd nerdy question there's a uh a lot of people are paying attention to stable coin right now uh I is that what fart coin is that that's an unstable coin for sure coin butthole people who don't know a stable coin is basically it's a digital token so it has the benefits of being like able to be trans erred online easily and programmable things like that but it's just pegged to the dollar so for you put a dollar in a bank account and then one digital dollar is created and that's the idea is that in order for the digital dollar to be created an actual US dollar has to be put in a bank account somewhere um and so there's companies like Circle and others tether who who are are supposedly doing this and I guess uh it's kind of like a lot of people believe it's like stable coins is taking off now there's some charts I think the Allin podcast been talking about this recently um a a stable coin didn't a stable coin business get bought or a tech business that that was got bought for over a billion by stripe a billion dollars by stripe so what's is there anything actually going on here or is this just all a lot of hot air I think there's something real here I think like there transferring money internationally is challenging and there's something called Swift which is how Banks do it it's basically like a messaging protocol um I I think stable coins can make things easier I think still at the end of the day I think people people people are overd stable coins because at the end of the day you on-ramp and an offramp to get money and they aren't that like I I had this issue I I had a wedding in India and um I needed to pay a lot of vendors in cash it was a lot of cash and I was like hey I tweeted it can somebody help me get a lot of cash in Mexico and the reality is there's a reason why it was so difficult and the reason is like money laundering and actually also even what I was doing was illegal because or what what my vendors were doing they wanted cash because they don't want to pay taxes and so the reason it's hard is because the government doesn't want you to De with a disc taxes and I had this convoluted thing actually you guys might appreciate I convinced my bank to let me normally you can withdraw a certain amount of money per day I convinced my bank Schwab to let me do $4,000 per account per day and I opened six bank accounts at Schwab and I was able to go to an ATM and withdraw $4,000 of cash per account per day and I was there for the the week prior that basically paid for lot of my wedding dude you know what the takeaway from from this all by the way is it's like that's the second time that you've said something where you've went to like a major institution and negotiated yeah like when I hear about like you you went to Schwab I'm like is Schwab a person that you can go to like I don't understand you know what I mean it's like it's like getting like Google AdWords help like or get it's like it's like if I had a Gmail issue it's like just hey Google yeah yeah I need you to fix this like I didn't even realize that you could call Schwab or call of America and like yeah I know you guys don't offer this but but uh you know you got to yeah I think if you explain your situation to them some actually one thing I do is like I know pretty quickly if I've got a good Agent or a bad agent and then if I have a bad agent I hang up and call like you know somebody who's like going like I just told them my story like told them what I needed and and then like somebody walked me through the process and I got it done and so I think you could do that all the time and speaking of negotiation or like talking through something I think something a lot of people should do is realize like you can negotiate at Macy's like I I did this with my wife my wife um she bought a wedding dress a post wedding dress at Macy's like it was for for one of our weddings and we were we were at Macy's and I was like I want to teach you to negotiate I want you to get a better deal on this dress it was like I don't know $400 dress or something and I was like can you get a better deal and she did she got like 20% off just by asking at Macy's for like a person at Macy's and she saved like 100 bucks or something dude that's do that yeah I mean I'll do things like like I'll be like hey um like I don't I won't know if they had a sale recently but I'll be like I think you had a sale recently like can you like you you had like a you know like for example like I went and got something at Brooks Brothers the other day and I know that one time a year they do like a 40% off sale and I went like 3 months after that sale but I was just like hey can you um can you match that and if you I always find I always prefer to go to women like the workers with that who are women I have way more success because they're just like easier to like get along with and like you know you like do like a little fake flirt but that works like way better for me is is for with retails just like talking to a woman and being like hey how are you doing today you know look I know this is a little obnoxious but can I get that sale discount or what yeah my buddy always they have like they have a bunch of QR codes or like a bar code and they just scan a code or barcode and it's like oh he was 20% off and like all you to do is ask my buddy Dan his mom was like the master at this if like when we were in college we would go try to like you know buy stuff for our dorm rooms or our apartment and she would just while we're checking out she' be like and give the boys a discount give these are college boys give these boys a discount and then they would be like what uh For What and like give a discount yeah she would just like come on give the give the boys a discount these they need it and then she would just tell them like give the boys a discount and sure enough 20 30 40% off would just happen like that and I would never even think to do it but she would just say it like like it's a done deal like oh it's happening not like do you think it'd be possible is there any way we would really appreciate it she was just like oh and then throw that in put the discount on top of it whatever you got like give give the boys like Alphas like every cler yeah exactly think it's a good I think it's something like I want my kids to learn like if I have kids in the future hopefully I will um like I them to learn these sort of things and it's like it's also like somebody posted like what job do you wish you had I wish I had a sales job growing up and like the people that are selling you like Dead Sea Cosmetics or something like they're just coming up to you or like cell phone accessories they're like hey what phone do you have and then they try to sell you something um I feel like those are really useful things that I wish I wish I knew the Dead Sea guy at the mall oh my God unbelievable skill set just an incredible skill set is that a scent or a lotion I think it's like a body scrub yeah got it and it's it's got to be like a 98% profit margin sort of B yeah didn't your dad sell like door to door or something sh yeah my dad sold encyclopedia door door when he just moved here from India it's actually a great story he like he um he was very poor in India he to come to the United States like he he studied at I in India great University and then like to come to America he needed to raise money so so he like raised money from the community to pay for his flight over and you had to have $300 uh to stay in America like on your passport they stamped that he had $300 he came with exactly $300 in his pocket and so he raised a bunch of money and he had to pay them back and he had the stipend as a master student and a PhD student and he decided to work as an encyclopedia salesman Indian guy thick Indian accent at that time he was in Louisiana Mississippi and Alabama door too selling in and he became the best encyclopedia salesman in the country and like yeah he really did and he he you asked him about it like what was the secret what was the pitch I think it was just like working day and night I think was the pitch and um crazy enough so he he made enough money to buy an apartment in like a condo in India like a one-bedroom condo in India and that's still the condo that like my uncle lived in and still like we still go and stay in that condo that my dad bought with his earnings from working as an encyclopedia salesman dude you actually have a bunch of good tweets about your dad like I feel like I kind of know about him like apparently did that video did you see the video recently well first of all he quoted Robert mugabi who is like a a dictator in Africa like the dad like at she's wedding he like gave a speech and he coted Robert mugabi who I think was like the dictator of Zimbabwe like he must have like it was about treating everyone well it was a good quote like he was clearly on like brainy quotes and he typed in like quote on love and like it was by like a killer dictator and then and my dad was like Robert Mugabe very very famous for his quips and I'm like I think Robert Mugabe was famous for something else but okay and then he's got this other video of his dad on a cruise like he's like we lost my dad but we found him dancing or something like that he's like dancing with this other couple and then and then so we went on a cruise family cruise a couple weeks ago it was awesome I I was very skeptical of going on a cruise we went with eight eight family members it was it was super awesome but anyway we we go to this tasting menu restaurant and my dad shows up with a pizza to the tasting menu restaurant and and I filmed him like the the people like were like pretty mad at him yeah I saw that I loved he like covered it with a napkin he's like oh no problem no problem and they're like no sir we can see it it's still there he Tre it like like a baby you like put something front of their eyes and it doesn't it just doesn't appear anymore exactly exactly that's hilarious um dude thank you for doing this well this was fun hanging with you as it always is and I recommend if you want to hear sh's story go back and listen to the episode I think it's episode 18 um I think it's called like the you know the guy who who you know made Millions on selling wacky domains um because you told your story kind of like in order there and it's a great it's a great episode I went you know for me to go back can re listen to my voice like anybody knows if you're listening to your own voice on a recording that's painful and so for the fact that I went through an hour episode this morning that means the episode's pretty good and they you guys made it so big yeah you were there you were the cause and you got to give uh she a follow on Twitter you are a great follow like you just do the like it's

stores and they have the the pit it looks like a pizza cuz it's like a nine square thing you have to like hop on like a small child and just like crawl around the couch because your feet aren't going to touch the ground and you did you bought it I love it it's it's so fun when you have people over but it's also modular so you can turn it into other things thanks for doing this man you're the best

if you click this video it's probably not the first video you've ever clicked like this maybe one like this or this or this there are a ton of videos on YouTube that are promising you how you can get rich quick and I get it because everybody wants that I wanted it too let me guess it didn't work you did not in fact get rich quickly and that's not your fault because most advice on the internet either comes from people who themselves never got rich or uh it's too vague it's too General it's just things like work hard find your passion things like that and as bad of a reputation as get rich quick has the truth is it is actually possible to get rich quickly right you can get rich slow you can get rich quick you can get rich but most of the people who are doing these videos they've actually never done it themselves a few weeks ago I was asked to give a talk at Berkeley and the talk I chose to give was called how to make a million dollars after you graduate and I gave that talk because that's what I wanted when I was a college kid like I didn't know any better I just thought well I'm what am I doing all this studying for why am I working so hard cuz I wanted to get a job that would be successful that would give me money and then I would be financially free and that's what I wanted I wasn't really ashamed to admit it now the problem was the whole time in college nobody was explaining to me like what do you actually go do to make that happen right I was learning about mitosis and I was learning about you know the history of the world wars and nobody was telling me I'm here at school to learn how to be successful nobody was telling me how to actually do that and so this talk that I gave at Berkeley has at the beginning it does have some of those core principles the things that you got to know in order to make this happen and at the end I have specific ideas is I call them my white belt businesses so the specific ideas that I would go do if I wanted to make this process faster it took me about 10 years but I think I could have done it in about four if I knew what I was doing so this is it I'm doing it this is my get-rich quick video [Music] enjoy if you're listening to this on audio I'm just going to tell you right now you're going to want to go watch this on YouTube because there's slides and they're good slides the slides with beautiful pictures on them they things that are going to make this way easier to understand so just go to YouTube and type my first million on YouTube and you will find this this video and while you're there just subscribe just do the good thing this is not going to be like one of those videos where the thumbnail and the title sound really good sound really promising and then you watch and 40 minutes in you're like dude what is the message that's my promise to you I'm actually going to tell you a bunch of really core principles with my real story and then some specific specifics of how you can actually implement this all right so let's jump in the premise of this talk is how to make your first million I says after Berkeley because I did this at Berkeley it's it's how to make your first million in your 20s so how to make it in a few years rather than working for 40 years saving up and then hitting this goal when you're 60 65 ready for retirement and most people who talk to you online or in person will tell you just follow your passion uh but I don't know about you I personally I liked the idea but I did not know what what my passion actually was uh if you told me what your passion when I was in school I don't know I would have said recess because there was not something that I was so passionate about that I just thought oh wow this is it this is my true calling maybe there's some some people out there that are that lucky but I wasn't one of them and so that advice didn't really work for me hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you could check it out if you just click the link below you can get access to these 200 AI ideas uh I'll give you an example of a couple of them one of them is you could build an AI dressing room so let's say you go to an e-commerce site and you want to see what something would look like on you you could use AI to actually take a picture of you and show you what the clothes would look like on you or what the makeup would look like on your face it's pretty cool right um or AI tools for real estate brokers maybe something that takes their listings and makes them more more fancy more more more beautiful and attract more buyers so check it out it's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below so I'm not going to tell you to follow your passion instead I'm going to do what somebody did for me when I was younger so this is me in college I went to Duke University and I thought I was going to be a doctor I was Premed I spent my whole college career taking physics and biology and chemistry classes and finally my last semester when I was done with all those requirements I had taken the mcats I was ready to go to med school I finally took the easy class I took the blowoff class the class that my roommate always was taken rocks for jocks type of classes and it was called getting rich I just took it for an eza but in instead it actually was the most important class I took my entire college career you know because I at the time I knew what I wanted right I wanted to be happy I wanted to be rich I wanted to have abs uh but you know my plan was just a there was no plan it was really just a goal goal and a goal without a plan is just a wish and so I knew what I wanted but I had no idea how to actually get there and then I met this guy this guy came into my class and he changed my life this is not actually a picture of him this is just a picture when I search cool men's haircut but that guy had a really cool haircut and he walked in and he blew my mind and so here's my promise to you my pinky is out for you here uh I'm going to tell you how I did it how I made a million dollars when I was in my 20s how you can do it and specific ideas that I would be doing if I was you today to go make it happen again because even if you don't follow my exact path I know better now I know how I could have got there easier and with less pain and faster and I'm going to tell you what those three three ideas are okay along the way between you today and this picture of you at the end lying on a hammock under an umbrella at a beach somewhere there are sort of five key checkpoints five things that you got to do in order to make that that dream happen to get to Paradise but you know before I give you any advice rule number one never ask directions from somebody who's never been to that destination before and you know or never trust a bald Barber for a haircut right I want to frast my credentials here so that you know that I'm Legit so if you give me a minute to brag I I don't like to brag but I got to brag here because you should not be listening to business advice or money advice from anybody who has not achieved it themselves here's my basic resume I've started over 10 companies three of them have sold I've invested in over a hundred others my current portfolio of comp that I own and operate will do close to $100 million this year in revenue and um that's where I'm at now and when I was in my 20s I started off completely clueless and so I went from Clueless to that and I think you can too it took me about 15 years I think you could do it faster if you knew better uh one of my companies bibo got acquired by Amazon I started a newsletter company called the milk road that got bought after about a year I also a quote unquote thought leader and I have to put Dr Evil up here because that's you know pretty embarrassing to even even try to say but the truth is have a podcast that's pretty popular have a Twitter that's pretty popular uh Justin Bieber follows me he did not respond to my DM so that's a little bit of a soft spot for me you get the idea okay I'm Legit do I have permission to continue are we good so this is me back in 2010 I'm sitting in that classroom and I am painfully average I have average grades I have an average social life it's not even so bad that I'm like oh wow this is going to make for a really great comeback story nobody was rooting for me because I was just in the middle and I was stuck and uh I was not bad enough where I felt even really a lot of motivation to change it I just thought that's who I am I'm kind of a middle of the- pack sort of guy so that was me Mr mediocre and what changed I met a girl not my wife uh it was a woman named Lisa keer and she changed my life my plan without even knowing it I took her class and in walks Mr Cool haircut and Mr Cool haircut asks a question he's supposed to be giving a talk but he says instead of giving a talk let me just ask a simple question who here wants to be an entrepreneur someday who here wants to be wealthy as and be a successful entrepreneur everybody's hands went up right so everybody had the entrepreneur side down and then he said cool you guys are all seniors right we said yes said awesome so you're graduating in just a couple months yes who here is already working on their business idea one hand went up and he said okay well who's who is who knows that they're going to go start a startup when they graduate and two hands went up he said wow so out of a class of 100% of people who wanted to go be an entrepreneur almost none of you are actually going to go be an entrepreneur what's up with that and um he said well what are you planning to do and person said well you know I do want to start a company someday but I I got a great job at UBS and I got a great job at McKenzie and they had everybody had great jobs lined up after school and so he just asked why and he asked why like we were crazy this quote from Andrew Wilkinson to me explains it well he said going to business school to become an entrepreneur is like reading a book about basketball history because you want to join the NBA in the same way going and getting a job um at a business in order to learn how to run a business uh that doesn't really work that's not actually what happens and instead what will happen to you is what Nim Talib calls the third grade addiction so the three three most harmful addictions in the world are heroin carbohydrates and a monthly salary and for most of us we will be trapped by that salary monster as soon as you get on that path of having the job and you have the salary it is very very hard to get off that and so that is the first trap for anybody who wants to get rich is that most of you will talk yourself into why you need to have a job I did this too by the way I went and got a job for about two months and quit by you know qu quit my my job for after two months even though it was a six- figure job straight out of college it was a good job and it wasn't like the job was boring or terrible in any way but I just realized like this is not getting me closer to the thing I actually want and so the safe path which was taking the job was actually kind of dangerous because it was dangerous to my dream right I think we all think of danger as danger to you like oh it's going to you're something bad is going to happen to you uh but the worst thing that could happen to you is that actually you choose a path and you spend all your time and energy working on something that's not your dream and so if I had a dream of being a successful entrepreneur which is what I did then the salary monster was the very first thing to avoid and so uh you need to slay the salary monster most of you will fall into the someday trap where you say that someday you will go start that company and someday you will make it happen but someday never comes my friend Trevor has his great anal analogy that I want to offer to you here and it's uh the story of two tigers and there's two tigers that were you know born together same mom separated at Birth and one tiger was taken by these wonderful tiger loving people and cared for and raised at a zoo he was loved every day they brushed his hair they fed him everything that he loved and they TR taught him new tricks they just cared for him in every way they could they they took care of him that is the zoo tiger and the other tiger was neglected was left alone in the jungle to survive on his own he had to if he wanted to eat he had to hunt if he wanted to drink he had to find water and and he had to survive against all predators and prey and so they became these two tigers the zoo tiger and the jungle tiger and um let me ask you a quick question so after 10 years of being raised this way if the jungle tiger was put in the zoo what would happen he would be bored he would be bored out of his mind he would be like uh what am I supposed to do all day I just sit here I just sit here and look pretty his entire way of life would be almost neutered and he would be put in a zoo and he would be uh bored out of his mind and this is most entrepreneurs if they ever get a corporate job they sort of sit there at their desk and they wonder what like what am I supposed to be doing here I don't understand why what does this job title mean and the opposite is also uh interesting so if you take the zoo tiger you put him in the jungle after 10 years what happens to him he dies he has no idea how to actually survive in the real world because he has been coddled and cared for and and lived in this structured box his entire life and that is the problem with the someday trap which is if you spend your your life in a in these jobs even good jobs even challenging jobs you are being raised as a zoo tiger and every year that you were in the zoo you are less likely to be able to survive in the jungle it's not impossible but man your conditioning is really wiring you for that so you get to choose early on if you are going to be a zoo tiger and a jungle tiger and you should know that the jungle Tiger's path is often much more uncertain much more uncomfortable and he's going to get dirty and and get some cuts and bumps and bruises but in the end it's what he wants uh to be able to survive on his own okay so that is The Zo tigle Jung Jungle Story and I say all of this to say that step one of being successful is not about intelligence it's not about experience it's not about strategy at all it is about courage and that courage is the rate limiting step for 99% of smart people and so if you consider yourself a smart person instead of trying to pour more water into the bucket of intelligence or information and read the next article or learn the next strategy um in fact you should actually look at your courage bucket and make sure that it is full and that you are ready to go because if you don't do that none of the other stuff will work okay let's move on uh oh yeah this is a little slide I had here courage is like toilet paper during a hurricane it is in scarce Supply it is not on the shelves okay now you've uh you've done step one you've decided to go do it you've decided to do it now not someday so uh what is the second thing that you got to do well the next thing that's going to happen is you're going to fail and you're going to fail miserably I know very few people who just decided to be an entrepreneur and then went and did it but you have to decide if you're going to be okay with that kind of failure and I love this bill bur quote I want to read it to you here Bill bur the famous comedian said he uh he knew he should go after comedy because he realized that sleeping on a futon when you're 30 is not the worst thing you know what's worse sleeping in a king bed next to a wife that you're not really in love with but for some reason you married and you got a couple of kids and you got a job that you hate and you're laying there fantasizing about chasing your dream and sleeping on a futon there is no risk when you go after a dream there is no risk when you go after a dream there's a tremendous amount of risk to playing it safe I love this billberg quote um and I agree with it wholly now let me tell you practically speaking strategically speaking how I did this so I decided when I graduated from college that I was going to spend a year strategically broke and I chose this phrase instead of saying unemployed or saying I'm traveling I said I am being strategically broke and I said that because it got people to ask me questions intelligent questions like what does that mean why are you doing that and I had to have a real answer for it and so uh I decided I'm not going to med school and I calculated what I call the freedom number and the freedom number is a very important number a lot of people will calculate their desired net worth they will calculate their dream amount of money that they want to have that is a sort of a maximum number you want to have but uh you actually want to calculate the minimum number and the minimum number I call the freedom number which is the minimum salary you need to have maximum Freedom okay so what is the minimum amount you need to earn that would give you the most of your time every day to go do whatever it is that you want to do um you know for me for example I calculated that I needed roughly uh I think it was like 15 grand to live on for the year and I said if I have 15 grand then I can pay all my bills and I can just spend all my time doing whatever I want and so 15 grand became my Target and this is when all my friends were targeting figure salaries or whatever they wanted to get as much as they could and they were willing to go work banking jobs 80 hours a week 90 hours a week trying to get that extra 10K or 20K salary whereas I was going the opposite way I was like can I tutor kids can I like coach basketball at a school like is there and that's what I did I literally I tutored stats uh um even though I was a C+ stats student and I taught basketball at a a school for autistic children and that's what I did that was my job when I was graduated from a prestigious School I decided to spend a year doing that because that paid me my 15K that I needed in the minimum amount of time it only took me like you know whatever four hours a week or five hours a week of time to do that and then I had 80 hours a week free to do whatever I wanted and so I wanted my freedom number to be hit and to do this you're going to live a little scrappy this is actual pictures from my apartment at the time so this is you know our art is like a towel on the wall this is ugly Craigslist couch uh we slept on air mattresses you notice that the air mattress is next to the couch because we put three people in a two-bedroom apartment like you know just the basic things this was our kitchen you know I don't know why we nailed the garbage bag to the wall but like we did whatever we needed to do we just didn't spend money on anything that was going to because it was decreasing our freedom if we spent money on other stuff and um we used that time to start our first business and this is usus on CNN pitching our first business with sabii sushi and um it worked right away we had a brilliant idea we were brilliant co-founders and we had a huge success right away oh wait that's not at all what happened actually it was a terrible idea we decided to start a suu franchise even though restaurants are terrible business and we knew nothing about the food business I started it not with two brilliant co-founders but with my two buddies who were equally clueless as me and um it did not work immediately it was not a huge success it failed badly and this failure was very painful because reality punched Us in the mouth we had told everybody we knew that we were doing this everyone we graduated with our teachers our parents our friends of family all of them and we made no money in fact we uh lost money doing this we burned about $225,000 of prize money that we had won to do this so we made no no money during or after and now we had a new label instead of being entrepreneurs we were labeled as failures and this is where I want to offer you a chance to play a game because this is the second fork in the road the first fork in the road was are you even going to get started right that was the salary monster well the second fork in the road is are you going to quit after the first failure which is almost inevitable and so if there was a game where I had a piece of paper and on this piece of paper I had let's say there was 10 circles and and under the 10 circles one of the 10 circles had a prize and the other nine were you lose try again so uh I let you play the game you pick a number think of that number in your head right now whatever number you thought of it's not that you lost okay cool uh so you lose round one and that makes sense you only had a one and 10 chance of uh of winning which is by the way similar to the odds of a successful business when you start a new business now the trick here is that even though the game is rigged against you meaning I have a nine out of 10 chance of winning you have a one out of 10 chance of winning you do have one tool at your disposal which is that you get to play the game as many times as you want well the funny thing about that is that if you get to play a game like this even with a one out of 10 chance to to win if you got to play that 10 times your odds of success now go up to about 65% so now you're an odds on favorite to win you're going to win two out of every three times you actually try that and so this is the game of Entrepreneurship the game of Entrepreneurship is you have to have the courage to start and then you have to have the endurance to try 10 times okay so these are my first two lessons to you number one start now number two play the game 10 times uh it took me 10 years to be successful and and that was about 10 attempts so um I think technically it was about 8 or n years total but 10 or 11 attempts in those eight or nine years that's about normal it takes about a year to try anything in in in Earnest and I was willing to try 10 times and this is the same as true for all of my cohort of friends so of all of my friends we were in San Francisco together we were in our early 20s and we all wanted to be successful a couple of them got it in their first second or third try but most of us it took about 10 tries uh but the amazing thing is that after 10 years almost everybody is successful you know the great quote from Naval is that startups fail but Founders don't and you got to remember that the startup itself might fail but you won't fail if you play the game 10 times now the third thing you need to do is answer this thought experiment if you know that you're going to lose many times for sure on the first and probably the first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh time that you're going to try this can you win even when you lose at Berkeley I had people come up to the um to the white board and write down an answer how do you win when you lose and somebody said well maybe you win because you um you learned some lessons okay that's great you won when you lost how else maybe you met some great people along the way you earn some connections great that's another way to win when you lose uh what else can you do and so the one that I want to draw your attention to is the skills that you will build while you fail and so even though the startups you're doing might fail in fact probably will fail even though you believe in your heart there's no chance this is going to fail this is totally going to work the one thing that you can control control that will certainly succeed is if you build your skill stack and there are three Master skills you must build along the way the first skill is learning to build the second skill is learning to sell and the third skill is learning to get lucky let's walk through them learning to build okay you are going to have to choose one way to build one way to make things it doesn't have to be building with your hands it can be it can be engineering robotics things like that so Elon Musk type stuff Rockets cars that's type of thing you can learn to build that stuff and you will suck it at the beginning but if you're going to do this for a few years you'll be pretty damn good by year 2 3 4 you will know what you're doing you'll be able to build at least prototypes uh and maybe even you know your V1 of things yourself so you could build things with your hands you could build things with code so you can learn to program you can build things as a designer you can also learn how to build or make content so you know this podcast YouTube channel you need to learn how to make something and so that is the first thing you're going to learn pick a path of what thing you're going to learn to make and then practice that Non-Stop and so you should pick the thing that you love the most don't don't try to strategize this just pick the one you're drawn to pick the one that you think would be really cool if you could do it that you think you would have the energy to do even when you're tired after work and that's the one you want to pick and that's the one you want to start doing and you're going to do it hundreds and hundreds of times um the second thing is learning to sell learning to sell is how you get the thing you made into people's hands this is learning Facebook ads this is learning Google ads this is learning how to do content marketing where you write blog posts and then the blog posts teach somebody something and then at the end you say here's my product you learn newsletter writing um and how to how to sell that way you learn copywriting skills so that you learn how what words get get people to actually click and so you need to learn the course at uh sales skills whether this is in-person selling whether this is phone selling whether this is cold emailing whether this is digital marketing one of those one of those paths you got to learn to pick uh and and figure out how to do and so the startups that you build along the way somebody's going to need to make the stuff somebody's going to need to sell the stuff you that should be you at the beginning and even though you suck at it and that's why your startup's going to fail you're going to build you know one inch at a time those skills so that you're actually good at it so then when you actually have a good idea you will be able to execute on it and the third thing is learning how to get lucky there are four types of luck if you've never heard this before I'll do the fast version the first type of luck is blind luck it's just you know a lucky break so you know you're standing still and lightning strikes you this this happens but you can't count on there's nothing you can do to influence it the second one is motion luck this is uh fortune favors the Bold this is you do so much stuff that you just get lucky more than the guy who sits still I think we all know this in our gut the person who's doing more things giving themselves more surface area more of a chance of getting lucky even if they're doing you know not the best things or not the most effective things or efficient things just simply doing more things than less will increase your luck the third is spotting luck so this is um you know the prepared mind mind this is when a guy spends his whole career analyzing stocks and then one day he reads a report that everybody else ignores but he knows wow this is a winner this is about to be a 100x return for me because he knows what he's looking for and the way you get spotting luck is Again by doing so much stuff that when you when something is actually an outlier you will be able to recognize it because you've seen 100 mundane things this is like in dating you've gone on a 100 bad dates that actually prepares you so that when you meet that remarkable person you actually recognize wow this is an amazing person do not let this do not blow this chance do not let them go do not just take the first no really go after it and so uh that's the third one and the fourth one which is your reputational luck it's where luck is like a magnet um the classic example here is that you are the world's best deep sea diver you are known for it you are renowned for your ability to dive deep into the ocean well when somebody discovers a sunken treasure all the way across the world their first pH call will be to you because of your reputation and this is why uh you know making content online is so valuable because if you get a reputation for being the guy or gal who knows about X then people start calling you they start thinking about you and other people's luck becomes your luck and so the three core skills you want to learn learn how to make things learn how to sell things and learn how to get lucky uh it is actually a skill that you can develop and you can intentionally do things to increase your level of luck uh a very simple one the fourth of the five things that you need to do is move and people don't like to say this because it sounds harsh it's a lifestyle Choice shouldn't you be able to Live and Let Live and just do whatever you want to do yes sure but if you want to increase your odds of success move because every city has a a whisper every city has something to it that is it's promise if you want to be an actor go to Hollywood if you want to be in finance go to New York if you want to be in Tech go to Silicon Valley and the reason you do these things is because every city has a certain energy and has a certain set of people in them that will conspire to your success you will be able to get a crew and being around a crew of people who are chasing the same dream as you is very powerful proximity Is Power just simply being near people who live the life that you want to live is the fastest way to become that person and the last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to give you three specific ideas that you can actually do three specific paths that you could pick now that you know the core principles right so the core principles just to review again number one you got to start now number two you got to be willing to play the game 10 times number three you're going to build your skill stat along the way along those failures build learn to make something learn to sell something and learn to get lucky and now number four and five are going to be around the specific ideas that um that I think you can pursue I call these white belt businesses it's basically a business that anybody can do with very little business experience they're pretty safe they don't require a lot of capital or um experience there's no big barrier to entry they're not the best businesses but they are the they're great starter businesses it's like you know when a kid starts a lemonade stand it's just an easy starter business to get into so here's three white Bel businesses that I think anybody could start the first one is a marketing agency so you want to learn that skill of how to sell well a marketing agency is going to be a forcing function to do that now the problem is most people don't know anything about a marketing agency they don't know anything about marketing themselves so they don't feel qualified to do this and so here's how you go about doing this you going to pick a um a versional marketing that you like maybe it's making video commercials and you're going to learn video production and actually create little YouTube videos that are going to be commercials for products maybe it's Google ads and you're going to help local businesses get discovered with Google ads maybe it's Facebook ads you're going to learn how to sell e-commerce products through Facebook maybe it's Tik Tok ads or Tik Tok videos because that's the new new field whatever it is that you're drawn to whatever you're interested in you pick one of those now you're going to go to a friend or family who has a crummy business you want something low stakes and you're going to go to this friend or family who's got this crummy business Aunt Patty who's you know selling um her little Chach keis out of her basement and you're going to go to a Patty and you're going to say a Patty I love your chachis best chachkies I've seen can I help you sell these and you're going to take a very starter budget maybe you know $100 a month at the start and you're going to figure out how you do how you would sell that online so if it's Google ads you're going to do Google ads you're going to study every free course on YouTube for Google ads you're going to join every go every Facebook group about Google ads you're going to be on LinkedIn and you're going to subscribe to everybody who's a thought leader on Google ads and then you are going to run your own Google ads all at the same time you're going to do learning and doing at the same time you're going to learn with your own time being free and you're going to have kind of crappy results but you're going to work your way up and so you know very simple thing you could do here is you can go to you can go to really any business because the good news is most businesses suck at at marketing so uh you can go to a a senior living facility nearby and you could say wow this is a senior living facility that is a service that people definitely need and they get a bunch of their customers through Google but they don't know how on Google ads and you can go offer to do it for them now the beautiful thing about a senior living facility is maybe they're charging three grand a month for one bed in their facility Well three grand a month means that one customer is worth 36 Grand a year you know in a in a year's time frame and so even if it takes you $500 or $1,000 to acquire a customer that's still super profitable for them and so you want to find any business that you can like a a local um plumber or a daycare or a senior living facility or whatever it is and you want to go offer to run their ads for free or audit their ad account for free or give them advice for free and then you're going to use that as your bootstrapping mechanism to learn and once you do that four three four times then you want to go to every other Senior Living Facility in other areas and say hey I did this for this company I can do the same for you and over time you start charging more for what you're doing and your goal is to you know eventually get to 10 customers that are paying you 5 grand a month for for your marketing services and now you're doing 50 Grand a month of recurring Revenue you've built built a million dollar business if you have a 50 Grand a month for curring Revenue business off of literally just hustle and commitment to learning how to Market through one channel because most people especially a busy business owner do not know how to do this okay idea number two if you don't want to start a marketing agency here's idea number two this is the real estate path now real estate is great because you know a lot of people become millionaires through real estate or own real estate I personally know more dumb millionaires in real estate than any other industry they take that as an insult as a backhanded compliment but I mean it is a good thing meaning you don't have to be a genius for it to work and I like games like that I I don't want a g to go into a game where you have to be the next Mark Zuckerberg in order to win and so real estate was one of those things and I'll give you an example of how to actually do this because most people think real estate I have no experience and I got no money how am I going to go buy a building well let me tell you what my friend will call him Alex in this case what he did and I think you could do this too he made he drew a FIV mile radius around where he lived and he contacted every real estate developer that he could find in that radius and he all he said was hey I'm Alex I'm a young kid near uh that lives nearby I'm super interested in real estate I see that you're really successful I love that property that you have over here you're somebody that that I think has has achieved something I would love to achieve I would love it if someday I could just take you out to lunch and learn a little bit of a little bit from you maybe somebody earlier in your career helped you and this could be your opportunity to do to do the same for me and that last line is really really key uh CU he's he's not really offering much besides I'll take you to lunch well guess what this Rich real estate developer or doesn't need your lunch but he does pull on their heartstrings a little bit and so he got lunch meetings with everybody and he goes to lunch with them and he ask them a bunch of questions about how they do what they do how they got into it what makes it successful what makes them different than everybody else etc etc and for the person that whoever he vibed the most with who he respected and seemed like they were interested in him and they liked his energy he would make an ask and he would say listen I know this is unorthodox but actually I would love to come help you out in your business and I'd love to come help you out for free uh because right now I've got a ton of time on my hands and I could go get any job I want but I don't want any job I actually want to learn from somebody like you and I want to learn this business and I know that to learn this business I'm going to have to work really hard and learn the ins and outs and I can't think of a better place to do this than with you would you be open to be working with you for let's just say 3 to six months uh I'll work completely for free I'll work harder than anybody you have in your office I guarantee you I will add as much value as I can and my goal up front I'll tell you this is that you know a year from now I actually want to go into this business myself and I actually want to go and try to buy my first property and I hope that at that time you know you might be my one of my investors but you know no no strings attached I just want to focus on the main thing which is learning this business inside and out by helping you out and he makes that pitch and this is exactly what he did and so he did a one-year Apprentice with a real estate developer that lived locally he learned everything he needed to know about the business and after at the end of that year he located his own First Property he bought it using the money from that guy who trusted him uh and and basically was willing to back him because he knew him at that stage and this is a path that anybody could take anybody can do this you can look up the people around you you can take them to lunch you can make this pitch and you can work hard for one year and in one year one year from now you can already own your first property and to be a millionaire in real estate really only takes a single property you know one fourplex or one eight Plex that you buy could be enough to do it and so that is the second path that I would advise anybody who wants to get rich quickly is to go under the wing of a successful real estate developer if real estate is something that interests you the last path the last idea that I think is you know if I was going back and trying to do it again f as fast as I could and as high as high likelihood of success as I could would be this it would be to buy a business now this is only for I'll say the top 5% of either brain power or experience so this is either somebody who's actually gone and worked in the in the real world for five six years maybe they're an NBA student maybe they've maybe you've managed some you've been a manager already at a business or you're just that high IQ and that driven and you know who you are you know if you're Cut Above the Rest and if you really are that person then this path is really really interesting I didn't even know about this when I was in my early 20s but now I know a lot about it it's called entrepreneurship through acquisition which is that you buy a business that is already working it has been working for years and you buy it using other people's money simple example we did an episode with uh Sarah Moore she graduated from college she wanted to buy a business instead of start one because she didn't have a great idea and so she searched again locally for any business that she could find that was already doing about a million dollars of profit a year and she wanted to go buy that business using an SBA loan and some seller financing you can go watch this episode to go learn what those terms mean and she was able to buy of all things a egg carton business like literally the the styrofoam container of eggs using zerar of her own money and she was able to own the business outright herself and she uh and this business does millions and millions of dollars a year of profit and she built her own this way and so this is the the fastest way to get to it because you're buying a business that's already gone through the startup you know learning curve and the bumps and bruises to get going and to get to work and you're buying something that's already already has cash flow and then you're just going to run it better because maybe you built that skill of learning how to sell and you know digital marketing and the current business owner doesn't they're just a retire a retiring you know Dad somewhere that never never ran a Google ad in their life and you know that if you started doing that you could grow the business 20 30% and so that's what you're looking for when you go this path so in summary the five steps to get rich quick the real the real steps things that you could actually do number one you have to have the courage to start and start now number two don't quit on the first failure you're going to need to try 10 times number three learn to build learn to sell and learn to get lucky that is your core skill stack um number four proximity Is Power move around other people who are as motivated hungry and ambitious as you it will just like osmosis it will just you will learn and get better faster just by doing that and the fifth thing being impatient with action patient with results uh the impatient action you should go take is one of those three businesses a marketing agency uh go and be an apprentice for a real estate developer and then become a real estate developer yourself or third go byy a business that is already working using SBA money and now you day one have a business that is profitable that you run and you own and you operate yourself so that is it I hope that was uh helpful for you and if it was leave a

50% of couples who talk to me do not know their household income money for most is not a source of connection it's a wedge I want to go deep on this this is actually cool in most relationships there is one money person and this is a huge mistake how do you get someone who's a warrior to start spending you need to learn the skill of managing money but you also need to learn the skill of spending money meaningfully tell me what to do I seven quick steps it's very easy first off [Music] all right we're live um REM me so the reason I wanted to have you on was because Sean and I were talking the other day and at the end of the episode at like minute 55 we got to the total end and somehow it came up that my wife SAR and I we do this thing that we just call our monthly money meeting and the way it works is that we like break down our monthly expenses our income and we also look at our net worth and we talk about how can we spend the next month to like make ourselves happier like what how can we use like money as a tool and are we happy with our consumption and whatever the the previous month and Sean made fun of me and he was like that's you're running that like a corporation like a business and at first I was embarrassed to say that I'm running my marriage like a business and then afterwards I was like actually no like I can love my wife and that's the number one reason why I do this and also in order to make it run effectively you kind of have to run a tight ship like a business or have like business ATT attributes and you have this book uh money for couples and you tweet all about this the stuff with your relationships and running it like a business and I thought you should come on and kind of talk about the other stuff of a relationship other than love which requires running it a little bit like a business well first of all I appreciate that Sean makes fun of you that's one of my favorite parts of this pod but when you are married you are running a business it is the business of running a household together and it's only in the last 100 or so years that Americans became infatuated with this idea of love as the only reason to get married that's ahistorical that's not been the case for a long time and just to give you example it's so culturally dependent my parents knew each other 7 days before they got married so you have to remember that it's not unromantic to talk about money I actually find it very romantic that you are building a connection and there's a whole bunch of other benefits that I'm sure you and I both experien because we talk about money regularly and you got this amazing podcast and a lot of the people you have some like really wealthy people I think you had someone who is making like2 or3 million a year and they talked about spending but I think your typical bread and butter is lowish six figures but our audience makes like I'm going to just make up avvatar of like two to $400,000 a year and they work at tech companies I think this topic is so fascinating to me because it cuts across psychology number communication and I personally think it's underexplored I think there's a lot of people online who talk about how to make money how to invest money very few people talk about how to spend it meaningfully and even fewer talk about how to do it in a relationship so if you're listening and you're single or dating or you've been married for 20 years odds are very likely that you have not substantively talked about money with your partner and it's important it is it's one of the core things in a relationship that's why I love talking about this do you remember Tim Ferris in the 4-Hour Work week he had this thing called like the dream scenario or something it's very similar to the stuff that you do it's something like write down all of the things you want to own and then like reverse engineer it to figure out how much do you have to earn in order to afford this and like like just like be intentional about what you want and specifically say it and work backwards towards it so I used to do that as a 22-year-old I think I had like uh at one point I owned everything that was on that list and I was like oh like half that list I don't really give a [ __ ] about even after I owned it but I remember a year into dating my wife it was like hey this is promising it appears we're going to like we're this is going towards marriage which is great and we did that dreamlining together and we used to do it all the time where it was like tell me like what's your ideal like life scenario like what would you how would you like to live and like let's like how much would that require like what responsibilities are you willing to take and what should I take on it was so helpful to do that early on in a relationship and it sounds weird but it was like a great conversation I love that it's uh amazing that the two of you did that early on because it's one thing to do it solo it's a entirely another thing to do it with a partner but what is amazing is that you two were on the same page of even talking about that you have to remember most couples they're not like that they're not sitting down to dream one person is probably a worrier another person might be an avoider or probably for the people listening they're optimized spreadsheet freaks who love to look at compound interest all the time and they're not even communicating in the same way so one person is like look at our returns look at our net worth and the other's like why are you talking about this like I don't think we're going to have enough why did you spend $20 at the gas station so you guys were speaking the same language most couples not even in the same Planet when it comes to money optimizers what is that oh there's four money types I talk about them in my book I talk to thousands and thousands of people and I found these four types that describe a lot of people first avoider this is the most common they avoid money they do a series of conscious and unconscious techniques to do it if they're in a relationship they'll say stuff like you're just better at money I'm not good at math sometimes they even sabotage conversations by saying stuff like why do you always have to talk about money can't we just have a good time that's an avoider and there's a whole bunch of techniques that you can use to not be an avoider or to have a partner that's a Voyer um then we have a Optimizer that is me that's you that's a lot of people listening optimizers you know they they can do a lot of good because they're saving they're investing the problem is you take it to the logical extreme and they become incredibly boring and cheap and all they care about is like the cost and how much is it going to we shouldn't buy this coke can because if we compounded that for 45 years it would actually be $1,200 it's like get a life optimizers are really hard to be partners with because they always go how much does it cost that's all they're concern with but they can change as well we have worriors worriors worry about everything uh in fact many of them saw that growing up and when I asked them what would it look like if you didn't worry about money they have no idea because that's all they have ever known and finally dreamers dreamers believe that success is just around the quarter dreamers it's it's the next gig it's the next deal these are the folks who typically fall into get-rich quick schemes and they are incredibly difficult to be partners with they're not listening they're not reading my book let's put it that way and the only reason they can live in la la land is that they are often subsidized by someone else often their partner those are the four money types you seem like you know you teach us stuff so I assume and I know you so I know it's true that you have your act together when it comes to money and if you are you're an Optimizer now you said what flaws do you still have and how do they present itself like on a daily basis yeah like for everyone listening Sam was like we were texting and S was like hey what are you getting on Black Friday and I was like I don't shop any place that does Black Friday sales and and that's like that's a difference but the fact is like you're you're an Optimizer so am I they just manifest in different ways so where do yours manifest in in ways that are good but also in Annoying Ways dude The Annoying Ways are the ones that when I was 22 it was like all about like look at these numbers you just need to do this it's so easy it's so clear and and then I could see people's eyes glazing over but I didn't know why and once you get a little bit older a little bit more mature a little bit better skilled at communicating you realize nobody wants to be talked to like that and in fact like in the areas where I have been really weak like Fitness where I didn't grow up knowing what protein was until my late 20s if someone was like dude it's so simple it would have been overwhelming and it would have made me feel stupid so I learned how to slow down become a little bit more emotionally connective but dude it's still there when I when I'm talking about money sometimes I'm like like okay I get it let's let's get to the part where we do the numbers and happens regularly my wife and I have monthly money meetings we have our annual Rich Life review and I can see it in myself I just want to get to the end because for me you know I was raised like efficiency is a virtue getting to that part is a virtue and I've had to really try to learn and I'm still learning sometimes slow it down take the journey have fun along the way we'll get there but don't be in a rush to get where we're going to get anyway hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of two 200 AI business ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you could check it out if you just click the link below you can get access to these 200 AI ideas uh I'll give you an example of a couple of them one of them is you could build an

fancy more more more beautiful and attract more buyers so check it out it's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below what's this uh you know it's December 30th when we're filming this what's the annual review oh man we're we're in the middle of it right now so this is like one of my favorite times of the year so in every December we have an annual Rich Life review and I would encourage everybody to do this so we sit down and we do it over several days we're in no rush and we start off by just going through our photos from the year and we go like what were our most memorable things that happened this year and a lot of them are favorites but some of them are not so good you know things that just bring up visceral memories you're talking about like a like a death or something like that yeah yeah bad that happened but a lot of good things that travel we did family we saw things like that and you just know it when you see it you just know it and looking over our photos what we do is we just put like 10 20 and we text them to each other and we talk about them what's this look like though uh actually look like like in the evening are you just hanging out over dinner what's what are you guys doing what if I'm like Sam I told you we're running a freaking business we're in a conference room what do you think no okay the truth is um when we did this just recently we were sitting across from each other like basically on our couch chilling but Mo most of the time we have these conversations we're actually traveling so we love to do this in a place that is different than our normal place it's expansive usually we try to surround ourself with beauty but you know that's not always possible so the point the setting helps but it's just about the two of us having time and space so here I am looking at my photos and it becomes very obvious to me the photos I chose like out of 20 eight 18 of them were with friends and family wow like that really tells me something about what's important to be and so we start off there like wow what was memorable we then talk about we had this little exercise that we did this year I came up with these um questions which was what if 2025 next year was incredibly generous and we started there and we're just like what would we do if we were incredibly generous and we just like came up with the idea back forth next adventurous so it's like uh like a Wilderness course you know I don't even know how to start a fire what if I went to a 3-day Wilderness court and and my wife was like go on your own I'm not trying to go to that but that's cool too you find out what you like what you don't like next was luxurious that was cool relaxed and then social so we're just dreaming we're just like coming up with ideas and we're writing them down and that's it then we start getting into a little bit more specific stuff what did we love this year what do we want to do more of these would be things like take a trip with friends spend time with our parents that kind of thing and then we're like What do we not like what do we want to do less of oh we tried to eat at this we got this reservation at this restaurant and it was a big deal and we actually don't really care about that type of stuff and then the last thing we do is we get into the numbers you don't need to say your numbers but tell me the the title of the numbers so for example you look at like your like your personal family's annual burn your personal family's income what else we're talking at the expense level now so we're talking line item but these are like the major categories in my conscious spending plan so things like um housing uh travel for us is a big discretionary expense all the M clothes Fitness those are the items we're talking about and we're like okay we projected this we hit this why did we diverge and so then it's like do we need to tweak it next year do we need to add more income this is the type of stuff where we're talking about like what are our distributions I don't know if we can handle that next year Etc and when you this is like I want to go deep on this so you're setting the budget for the next year as well and and when you're doing the review what percentage on track are you typically are you typically over what is your family over or under that's a very good question we're never exactly on never we are we are definitely over in certain categories travel almost always over so we adjust it every year the dream is like you're going to nail it but we never will we leave buffer we always leave buffer you add 20% oh yeah I have like handy guidelines for buffers so for example for uh like a wedding you 2.5x like right there yeah okay for a trip for travel add 50% right off the bat so if you think your trip is going to be 3,000 it's actually going to be 45 got it so it's not like unilaterally like all right we budgeted $100 just assume that our or whatever $100,000 for the year for our whole life assume that it's going to be $120 um we would do that for fixed costs so fixed costs which are like your rent your auto you know your fixing typically I would say add 15% because there are things that people forget about that's just a weird guideline by the way that's what I do with my businesses I like whatever we say the budget is in my head I'm like 30% over okay let me tell you why I think there's so many different ways with money you can internalize lessons like Fitness luxury I had this experience we stayed in a hotel in Thailand it's a it's a high-end hotel and I whenever I go to one of these hotels I always ask to see the general manager and I go on a walk on the property with him him or her and I go why why are you laughing it's weird it's it's just that's a really Caren thing to do but you're doing it for a positive thing what the hell are you talking about I'm not saying like here are all the things that are wrong I asked them tell me how you run this hotel like what are the clientele so for do you do that at the front desk or does your assistant or you send an email I'll be checking in like dude I want to get because let me explain Ari here's why RIT said hey do you want to come to New York City and hang out with me I'm going to plan for something us to do and I was like hell yeah and he was like what do you want to do and I was like whatever you're interested in because I know you're super into it take me along and so we went to the Aman giri or Aman New York is that what it's called I'm Aman New York yeah like the fanciest hotel in New York City and the general manager or some like a some manager type gave us this like 1 hour specialty tour of this like three or $4,000 night hotel and I was like dude how do who did you email to get this so I I like hotels I like hospitality and whenever I go to these hotels the manager will when you're staying there the manager will come up to you at a certain point and greet you so I'm always like hey I'd love to like learn more about the property do you have any time and they love it they love it got so we went on a walk and it was December at the time so I said what's your occupancy and they had something like 40 keys or 40 hotel rooms he said um it's about to get busy Christmas is our busiest of all but we always keep one room off market and I'm like why would you do that when it's the busiest most high demand most expensive time of the year he goes luxury is about always having something in your back pocket he goes maybe our regular guests who come every year for the last decade bring an extra family member we need to be able to accommodate that so I will hold it off market and I'm like Ah that's a very expensive thing but I think about my mom growing up she always had extra food if we brought a friend over luxury just at a different level so same thing with money I want to always build in a buffer so that if something happens we're good no sweat and how much what percentage do you um like do you do you assume that every year your spending is going to go up like 5% 10% uh no that I probably should but I don't do that that that would be good we we look at what we're going to do next year and typically like um we have like certain things don't really change for example rent or whatever it won't change that much but if there are big life events those might change so we're not doing it on a percentage basis we're looking at Big discrete events because we already have the foundation kind of laid out and then do you assume and you you guys are both entrepreneurs and so let's do it for the question of like you and me entrepreneurs and also let's do this for uh like a Facebook employee do assume that your income is uh flat up or down great question my wife and I are both entrepreneurs so we we as we take a standard salary which we talk about at that annual Rich Life review what is our salary going to be and it's typically the same salary I didn't change my salary for like 13 years but we talk about distributions so so are we play how does the business look next year what numbers are we going for what do we think our distributions will be and we use distributions which makes our system a little bit complex we get them on a quarterly basis if we take them and then we have a determination we have a percentage like where does it go how does it get split up all that stuff is all documented we look at the document once a year in December and we decide is this Fair does this feel good do we need to tweak anything but it's once a year yeah and that's where it gets complicated because I do this with Sarah and I'm like well if business goes good then it could be this if it if something happen you know [ __ ] happens you know like if you run an SEO based company Google makes a change and like my my situation has just changed um I don't I have to tell you I this is maybe a strength also a weakness I don't want to have to go backwards right so like it that appeal to me that's true in a lot of parts of life for example speaking of hotels if I stayed at one hotel room one time I'm not going to a lower level hotel room I want to stay at the same level or go higher why just because for me that's a point of Pride and something I value for other people it might be their car you know they finally got a whatever's a nice car and they don't want to go back to the Honda Civic that they grew up driving whatever I feel the same with money if we decide we want something I'm going to be very very careful before I commit to spending on something that is probably something we don't want to go backwards on otherwise I just wouldn't do it as an example if somebody starts to fly well I know you've talked about flying private you know for a lot of entrepreneurs it's like one of the things they want to do great if that's a goal I wouldn't do that until I knew I have no Financial chance of ever going backwards because that's actually really hard for people and that's but that's rooted in your business which means like my business is stable enough that it's likely going to continue to grow at some even if it's a small five or 10% but it's like a stable recurring is revenue business that type of thing yeah or you have enough net worth to float it yeah but what what I'm really encouraging people to do is you don't have to do this for everything you know like some years you have a a splurge on some restaurant maybe you're going to go back maybe not whatever but if it's really important to you it might be we're sending kids to this school or we're going to decide that we're flying business class or whatever be very very careful before you make a purchase that is recurring and you don't want to go back once you do it make sure you're solid forever how long does this annual meeting annual review last and what's the homework to prepare for it it lasts several days we're in no rush so it's like we'll talk for a couple of hours and then we're off doing whatever we're doing whether we're is it on your calendar yeah it's on the calendar it has a link to um all of our docs the one from last year we review it some of it is so some of it is structured like we're talking about we have these questions what do we want to change Etc and some of it though is really organic and I think that is the part that might surprise people so in my life I'm an Optimizer and so I'm I love structure I love it and I think that has become a weakness of mine where I always want the black or white answer and I need to like make sure it fits in these cells and so I've been trying to become more in intuitive and I find that I'm most intuitive when I'm traveling cuz I'm like what do I feel like seeing where do I feel like going what about us and I'm trying to bring that to these meetings so like this question about like generous and adventurous that was an intuitive thing that I was thinking about and then we started talking about it and there was a lot of energy so we spent like few hours talking about that that is how I love to approach this a combination of literal and also intuitive what's the um monthly meetings look like ours usually looks like we use Monarch do you know Monarch money that's just like a cool thing that in my opinion that's my favorite tool for tracking monthly expenses we so we go over that and then we say like all right next month like what Adventures or things do we have planned and is there any like deviation or alterations that we want to make make for that we also talk about um different goals that we have throughout the year like um it could be um we want to take family on trips it's like all right like do we have do we have that plan and what went well last time what didn't go well whatever and then we talk about like do you want to buy anything like is there anything you want to buy I love that I I love every time I hear you guys talk about how you do money it makes me really happy because like there's a lot of connection and I hope that's inspiring to other folks because money for most is not a source of connection it's a wedge it's actually something that's avoided most couples really substantively talk about money about four times in their entire life what does that mean so like is there like a bunch of I mean I guess this is obvious this is an obvious question but I guess there's typically a bunch of wives out there who have no idea like what the income is and like is is that like typically what it is 50% of couples who talk to me do not know their household income 5 Z they don't know their household income as an example this happens all the time I had a couple recently who said um I think we would uh we would feel good if we made 120,000 and we're I'm looking at their numbers which they prepared for me and according to their preparation they make 80k okay so now I'm digging into this and I'm asking about bonuses they go oh yeah we get a bonus once in a while and I'm adding it all together it turns out they make something like 121,000 and they just look completely dumbfounded why because for years they've been telling themselves we'll stop worrying when we make 120k they've been making it for years and what it really shows is the way you feel about money is highly uncorrelated to the amount in your bank account so no they don't talk about money most see it as a negative thing they see it as something to protect their partner from they see it as something like you do the dishes all mow the lawn but it's none of those it's got to be a source of connection which is the thing you talk about but by the way you were giving me credit for these meetings like they still like occasionally end in fighting like like it's like it does it always it doesn't they don't always end well which is like there's not we are on the same page to discuss it but we are not always on the same page of our wants sometimes there's decisions where there's a winner and there's a loser and so it's like you know how can we both win in in one of these situations but it definitely becomes like a who's the money person and it's like not just like who's earning it but who's driving I guess it's frustrating to have if I'm the one driving all the time I'm like I want you to care about this as much as I care about this Sam I'm with you okay listen so in most relationships there is one money person and this is a huge mistake again most of us think of as something that's just divided like every couple does we all divide task just on time intuition Etc or just habit but money when I got together with my wife of course I was it would have been natural for me to be the money person this is what I do for a living I think about it every day and I very early on realized that would be a horrible mistake and I told cassander I said we're going to do this together I'll tell you why number one one day I'm going to get hit by a bus some [ __ ] from Goldman Sachs wealth management is going to call her oh we glove to help you be a steward of your portfolio [ __ ] you wealth management industry so she knows exactly about expense ratios and fees otherwise I'd be looking up from Hell saying what's about to happen right now with this conversation but I know she's an amazing manager of money then I wanted us to have a second set of eyes no matter how good you are at money it's always better to have another person make decisions together and third is just way more fun way more fun to be doing this together where do you want to go next year who do want to be generous with all those things so it's a huge mistake to be the money person in a relationship or let your partner and that is becoming bigger and bigger because a lot of men die early leaving in in hetosexual relationships they leave their wife often defenseless the wife doesn't even know where the money is much less how much much less what to do with it bad bad situation so that is a big Noto dude I was telling Sarah the other day ever since we had a kid I have this weird dream it sounds weird to even say it but I have this dream that she dies and like 3 weeks after her death I'm like I don't even so the way my household works is I like focus on making the money and she is in charge of like tracking and spending it so like paying rent or mortgages and things like that and like I like when we when I when she died in my dream I'm like who do I pay this rent to or like do you know what I mean I was like I I literally don't know like what health insurance provider we have and how they get their money versus how like we like there's or like who's our dentists you know what I mean me like I didn't even know like certain things like that and it honestly freaked me out and I couldn't imagine being on the other side of that of like how do we earn exactly I mean it's kind of funny when you say it but it's not funny if you're the person who doesn't know where the money comes from or how are things supposed to be paid and it's actually terrifying and very very bad situation to be so all right let me talk about the monthly money meeting and how to do it it's quick it's 60 minutes so you're kind of moving through these things I have six quick uh seven quick steps it's very easy all right first off appreciation kind of unexpected always start off with something you appreciate about your partner look at Sam's face right now s go what the [ __ ] is this woo woo weirdo talking about move to LA start talking about appreciation where's the crystals I laugh because we do that uh and it's definitely still uncomfortable oh yeah okay fine damn impressed like I think you told me about it like I've been doing we've been doing these for years but like I'll like you or someone else like share something and I'm like I'm going to add that yeah I'm thankful I'm so uh I appreciate that whenever we travel as a family you always make sure we get to the airport at the right time simple I me you cannot say enough nice things all right so that's number one number two is partner One updates quick things usually each partner will own one part of the financial system it could be they own how much you spent on groceries last month or it could be making sure that this account flows to that and changing things just a quick update if something has not gone right like hey we agreed that we're going to spend 700 on groceries last month I actually wasn't able to hit that it was 850 here's what I'm doing about it next month right they own it they get ahead of it they talk about what they're doing as a plan um take a shine a light on it don't let it Fester partner two does the same thing three then you're doing joint updates so are there any things we need to talk about together hey what's up with your 401k are you having the correct match that kind of thing five review our numbers so like are there any critical numbers I actually don't look at many numbers on a monthly basis because we plan it on an annual basis and we look at it on a six-month quick check-in because that gives us time to adapt if we need to but I'm not trying to look at the freaking price of uh noodles in February I don't want to talk about that six open issues anything open and then seven wrap it up always end with I love you I appreciate you give each other a hug start to align money with feeling good and it might feel cheesy at first you do it four five 10 times you're going to actually start to feel it you tweeted out this thing or I think it was from the book that you shared but it had percentages for it had like threat um like Benchmark numbers of like sa this percent um invest this percent spend this amount on guilt-free things can you do those same percentages but for a couple that earns 300 or let's we're actually going to round up for math uh $500,000 a year okay I'll give you the standard numbers first quickly and then let's talk about how things change if you earn more so there are four key numbers you need to know in your financial infrastructure I love it just four you don't need to track the price of pickles the the first is fixed costs that's rent mortgage groceries debt uh Auto that's 50 to 60% of take- home pay next up is investing that's 5 to 10% of take-home pay of course that's where real wealth is created so I would prefer the higher the better next is saving this is an emergency fund saving for a down payment even saving for a kid's activity or a vacation 5 to 10% and finally my favorite one of all guilt-free spending this is eating out travel buying arounded drinks whatever 20 to 35% so for me the beautiful part is if you can fit it in like Tetris fantastic you can buy whatever you want as long as you're hitting these key numbers it's very freeing now when I look at couples or individuals who make a lot of money 500k as an example there's a couple of things that are common the first is their fixed cost number tends to go lower because their income is higher so instead of 60% or in some cases people have 60 70 80% their number is like 50% it's on the lower end of that range once in a while depending on where they live it can even be lower than that their investing is typically higher people who are making that kind of money typically not always but typically tend to be a little savvier with investing and because the price of bread is basically the same like yeah you might spend double the price on bread but you're not going to spend 50 times more on bread therefore you have more money left over typically that goes into investing some of them save aggressively so sorry they for investing they might have 15% of take-home pay if they're in the fire Community or they're very aggressive they might go 20 25% of net pay I like to see that number around 20% as your income gets up because you when you have that kind of money take it make it work for you um you have the earlier you can do that you can really let it ride and grow savings 5 to 10% sometimes they go a little bit higher you know what I often find with guilt-free spending they can certainly be spending at the higher end of that 35% of 500k is a lot of money or 35% of the take home oh these are all post tax correct post tax um sometimes I will see people who are investing like crazy they're doing 40% or 30% of take-home pay and I'm like there's a lot of money your savings is really high and then I get down to the bottom of the conscious spending plan and they're spending like 8% on guilt-free spending and I'm like what do you guys do for fun and they're like they always say the same thing well you know all we like to go we go to the park we actually have money set aside and I go like this do you actually spend it and then they both look down because they wait till the end of the year they don't spend their money and then you know what they do with the money that's left over from guilf free spending they sweep it right into their investing and they go we're so good we don't spend money we invest it that's a big mistake you need to learn the skill of earning money you need to learn the skill of managing money but you also need to learn the skill of spending money meaningfully so if you're making 00k you should be learning how to spend that on the things that are meaningful to you how do you get someone who's a warrior to start spending it's very difficult let me tell you why it's so hard I I frequently have multi-millionaires who come on my show and you know sometimes one or both of them's like we want to learn how to spend more and people listening are like what kind of freaks don't know how to spend money that doesn't make any sense I'm one of them yes it's a very common Affliction and it is an Affliction because there there are a lot of reasons for it often people grew up financially insecure family only said we can't afford it the only way they've related to money is scarcity but when the numbers change they change faster than the psychology changes the problem is that you can get to a point where you have more than enough but you're unable to actually spend and I see several things happening um one I see people who realize at a certain point like this isn't something's wrong we have these numbers on a spreadsheet but it doesn't feel real I went through this where it was like as an entrepreneur who s so my business I sold it and made uh I had a windfall leading up to that it was like uh like I think I think I ran the company for four years but something like the first three years well the first two years I paid myself roughly $24,000 a year which was so stupid people should not do that because my business was doing fine I could have paid myself more um and so the third year was more but it was like $100,000 a year which in San Francisco is not like crazy amounts of money so but so there was like a long period of like not a lot not a lot not a lot a lot and then it took like another three years to acclimate to the reality I love that reality it's pretty unusual most people don't get the windfall like you did but it may as well be the same thing because they look at the numbers and they're still feeling the way they felt when they were 7 years old sitting around the dining table and their mom or dad said how dare you ask for that we can't afford that and so I know you've been on a journey to spend more money it's awesome to see you talking about um Men's Wear now talking about taking your family traveling like that's not easy that is really not easy what what I find is the ultimate um thing that happens with folks is they start to ask for help and they look around and they make two mistakes one is they ask for help among among a bunch of other frugal people so I see this in the fire Community every day hey everybody I I realize I've crossed my fire number but I can't seem to know like I can't seem to bring myself to spend money and then within three comments people like you don't actually need to spend money it's actually better to save you should save it because who knows what Healthcare is going to cost in 2065 I'm like you're asking a bunch of frugal listas how to spend money you're asking the wrong Community well it's like asking me how to go camping don't ask me I have no idea okay that's the first second is they come around and they start to actually try something maybe they eat out at a restaurant whatever and the first time they do it it's it's not particularly great maybe they picked a bad restaurant maybe they don't have the pallet for it maybe they hired somebody to come clean their apartment or house and they don't like how the person folds their clothes okay that happens so then they go ha this [ __ ] doesn't work I actually I'm a good person cuz I don't spend money I don't need to do all this frivolous stuff that other people do so they cre created this self-contained tautology which ensures that they're never going to change there's a much better way to do it it's to build the skills now it's to start spending on Little Things discover what you like what you don't become clear with your money dials enjoy it do with a partner and over time you learn that spending money as a skill is often as important as earning and managing it too and I think that like the important thing is um figuring out what makes you happy because you like there's been times where I'll talk to you or me to you and we force what makes us joyful onto the other person like for example you like fancy hotels and you're like you should go stay at this hotel it's like that's just not I'm not I'm I'm kind of this is a fake story a little bit because you don't do this too much but or or maybe even ever but it's like go say it that's like fancy hotel you're going to love it it's like that's not my I don't I don't get joy out of that but what I love is like services like uh monthly services like uh so for for you for example you don't own a house because you're like I just don't get joy from that um and I don't I don't know what your apartment looks like there but like for all I know it could be just like a very very modest apartment cuz you get joy spending elsewhere and I think that that's like a really that's a really challenging thing for people to get over because for example they'll say like here's a really easy one they'll say like buy a home it's a great investment and I'll say um well it's typically not a great invest or like that's not the reason to buy it and they like well you're going to throw away money on rent and I'm like well you're not throwing money away I'm acquiring a service and it makes me happy and I'm also like buying I'm like I'm my money is now in a in the index fund that's growing so like that's a good investment and they'll like so you shouldn't buy a home and it's like well no no definitely buy a house just like I bought a stake last night I bought this stake last night because it brought me joy and if like owning your home makes you happy and by the way way it often times could be a good store of value uh but like which is a which is just a cherry on top but do it because you work and this makes you happy and that's a good reason to do it it's hard for people to understand just doing something because it brings you Joy and and I've been there too yes I love what you're saying and I love watching you on Twitter because you're one of the only people who actually understands buying a primary residence is is sometimes but often not a great investment here's what I think I think that people use the word investing way too much like I have a personal trainer that's not an investment that's a luxury um if I if I were to buy a house today that would not be an investment that would be the most expensive luxury I have ever bought I will lose Millions one day when I buy a house I guarantee it I'm going to lose M and I'm going to do it with a big smile and you're G to be ridiculed on the internet because people know you as the guy who has they they they say but R you said never buy a home well illiterate people who don't actually read what I've said I never said don't buy a house I said run the numbers then consider the non-financial and then but yes you're right there's going to be a big problem when uh I buy a house uh anyway we use the word investing a lot to justify purchases like I've had people who literally said buying a mattress a $2,000 mattress is an investment that's not an investment that's a luxury so and when I asked him I this got me very obsessed how do you know if you can afford it and do you know what people said to me they were like your back is the most important investment you can make I was like hey when I ask a question about affordability your answer better have a number in it affordability is a number not a feeling and what I've realized is so many of us use investment to justify purchases but what's the the approved answer to that my So my answer for an investment I narrowly Define it as something that can provide a financial return simple otherwise here I am justifying a $3,000 in night Hotel oh their air conditioning is triple filtered therefore the hair on my arm doesn't stand up therefore I can write a new book that makes me $100,000 it's BS same for the face cream I use it's not an investment it's a it's okay to say I like this and I'm going to buy it because I like it that's totally fine now the affordability question becomes more complicated you have to know your numbers and you have to have your percentages dialed in but affordability is a financial question it is not about feelings and for the optimizers listing I will say sometimes when you're talking to a partner who's not an Optimizer they want to talk about feelings and in the book I emphasize how important feelings are you've got to meet your partner where they are you can't just talk about numbers alone but but sometimes you need to actually engage with the numbers feelings are good you should spend a lot of time on them but at a certain point you're running a business the business of a household and you need to look at the numbers how do you get over disagreements like if you or your wife is complaining to each other the most common reason for these disagreements is there is no shared vision of a rich life it's literally one episode after another of nitpicking and the perfect example I have is a uh a person who wrote me on Instagram DM and said can you convince my husband to stop buying iced tea every day I said okay how much does it cost she goes it's $5 every single day we can make it at home I said okay interesting hey out of curiosity what's your household income and she became very KY but I gently asked her to share it she lives in New York she and her husband you want to guess what they make I don't know what $200,000 a year $600,000 a year so what you could see is that it's really not about the $5 to him it was like hey we work hard this is just a little treat that I enjoy every day it's great to her it was values based on how she was raised and why would you spend money outside a couple of thoughts when couples have disagreements whatever the scale the first is I always ask him what is your rich life couples don't know they never talked about it they've only talked about why did you spend that much on a drink so what do we want in our life what's important to us do we want to travel do we want to send our kids to this activity get into all of that which I go into detail on the next is to have your accounts set up so that you don't have to have $3 conversations s you said that the audience we're talking about today makes 200 or so plus K per year you should not be talking about $3 purchases if you're making $200,000 a year if you are talking about $3 purchases you have misaligned your money uh systems and you probably don't have a rich life so the way that you set up your accounts to be United in a marriage I highly recommend all the money goes into a joint account and from there you each have some of the money flow to a separate individual account a no questions asked account which both of you know about but each of you only has access to your own and if that person wants to buy the $5 lemonade or the $20 uh tip it's totally up to them that's their money no questions asked that is how you unify your financial relationship and also give each other a little bit of flexibility yeah I did that this year I have like my own little my own account um how did it change things you know I think that even though you called me an Optimizer I'm a little I'm more of a worrier and I I I I definitely feel I feel guilt often times buying things um if they're above a certain amount maybe in the thousands of dollars range and so I put 20 grand into an account because I was like here I'm newly into somewhat newly into clothing and I got interested in like the the the craftsmanship and a lot of like this Japanese [ __ ] that I love it's like pretty expensive like it's like um $600 for like a button-up shirt but like it I'm just like deeply fascinated by what I'm reading and I just want to like feel and touch it and it's interesting to me but feel a sense of guilt around it so I was like look I've allocated $20,000 I could spend this guilt free and so I will spend it I still feel guilt but it's it's definitely less guilt but now at least I know that like I I used to feel a little sense of I'm disappointing Sarah because even though she's like on board with it I'm like I'm taking money away from from [ __ ] that she could use for something else and I was like and I'm also like I'm embarrassed to spend $600 on like a a shirt and I don't want her to know do it it came from all these just being raised poor uh [ __ ] that like you know it it never goes away you just like it's just like any other like Daddy Issues anyone ever ever has it never goes away you just try to manage it yeah I like what you said about I used to feel that I was taking away from her yeah and what I see in the way you talk about it and how curious you are cuz we text about this stuff a lot is it feels to me now you are actually adding to your own curiosity of course you your family finances should be dialed in of course you should have all your ratios working and your money flowing of course but we should remember that two partners have got to be intellectually financially fulfilled it makes them better partners and as long as you're managing your joint money you should be spending on your own one of the one of the worst things I see this happens a lot with men is men become shell of who they used to be so you talk to a guy in their 20s they have all these hobbies and interests you talk to them by their 50s and I go what do you like to spend money on they go whatever my wife does I go we're not doing that here answer my question what do you like to spend money on and a lot of times they've lost all Hobbies I see that in myself I have to fight to to try to find some new hobbies because if it were just up to me I would simply shrink myself and so this happens to happens to a lot of people but especially men and I I want to encourage us to try to fight against that when I was kind of up and coming in my like entrepreneurial journey I used to make fun of like um like self-development people what you you fall in that category and so do I and I'm play right now well no but like I wouldn't make fun of you but like just the idea of like people would be like I'm hiring like an executive coach or I'm hiring a coach I'm like what like man up what are you doing and then I um and then I started like hiring um a fitness coach and then a nutrition a nutritionist and by the way a fitness coach could be like as cheap as like $50 or $100 a month with like future one of these things but basically just someone to like answer questions and then also just tell me what to do and I started doing that for so many different things so I did for it starts with Fitness because that's the easiest application but then you're like uh we we actually hired a home organization expert to come in and like teach us and I'm like dude this is so much better way of learning to like read a book and also uh like you know the book YouTube whatever all that stuff to get the general knowledge but then have an expert come in and pay them money it could be a small sum like you could you could do a lot of this [ __ ] for 100 bucks like a cooking class or something like really simple on Groupon if you really wanted to but like simple coaches to come to teach you but then the best situation is like some type of ongoing like class do you know what I mean it's like the greatest way to learn I love that you said that I also love that you said I used to say man up because just think about what's embedded in that phrase right that suffering is masculine and that if something is hard it is therefore more valuable I think there's some truth to some of that but I also think that yeah yeah like there's grit grits real yeah agree and I think that sometimes we make things too easy for ourselves and there is value in a challenge but I also think that there's no prize given for living a smaller life then you have to so I really want to inspire people to think about the things that you are interested interested in there's probably somebody who can help you enjoy it more I talked to a guy in the fire community and he was like I just don't really like to spend money like I'm good so I asked him like what do you like and you gave me these generic answers so I probe I really like to ask tell me more he goes I love coffee and he goes I buy these beans okay and he's like that's that was the limit of what he thought he could do I said Hey What If you hired a barista to come to your house and teach you how to make your coffee in even better it never occurred to him and I love that he was receptive he later went on to do that imagine that that's 100 bucks 200 bucks incredible I had a a book that I read about posture I was like I don't understand these freaking diagrams how am I I don't get it so I hired them to come to my apartment and teach me how to improve my posture that posture coach was transformative for me it did it work this that worked dude it changed my life when we think about posture I I had something that was going on like when I would stand I would find myself crossing my legs it became uncomfortable on my back and I'm like this is weird I'm like a young guy why and I finally going from problem orientation to solution orientation is like a major shift we can complain about stuff all day long but there's a certain point where some people go I want to fix I found her she came to my house the first thing that happened when I opened the door she looked at me and she was like shocked but she's like what and I was like hey why are you looking at me like that and she she said something to the equivalent of her average client is like 75 years old and I was in my late 30s at the time and I said look I've got a little weird thing but really this is preventive I want to learn how to be better at this before I have problems and that is the dream of any coach is for somebody to come to you before they have major problems proactively we worked together I think six or nine times she taught me it's posture is not just about putting your shoulders back it starts from your feet and your knees and your glutes the way I walk she videotaped me walking and Chang that and the pain there's no pain there but more importantly I can understand how the Body Works a little bit better than I used to um to W to the last question I want to wrap up uh this is funny that you put this on this doc that we had but someone messaged me he's a good friend of mine and I love him to death so I'm making fun of him but I I I I love him um he was like I want to come in and talk about credit card hacks and I was like uh you know like ways that you could save like get like 5% cash back and [ __ ] like that and I'm like I get why you you like that and like sometimes that's always fun to geek out on like cool puzzles and whatever but like that's not needle moving to me or to a lot of people like I don't give a [ __ ] about like you know 2% cash back because that means I got to have like 10 credit cards and that's like [ __ ] complicated it's like just to make $1,000 it's like I'm going to spend like 10 hours on this I'm probably going to forget to pay like it just this is a [ __ ] nightmare and um you have on here your like fight for simp the more successful you get the more you have to fight for Simplicity I have found that to be true and this is definitely a champagne problem but as just like some things get as you get a little make a little bit more money like you start thinking like well everyone else has a wealth advisor or everyone else is doing this or people everyone else is investing in PE should we like do these things should we do that and what's funny is like maybe there's some other level I'm sure there is like when you're worth hundreds or billions of dollars where it's like yeah like you actually do need to be a little complicated but for the most part for most everyone listening Simplicity is the answer I think is that right I think so I understand why when you're upand cominging and young it it's fun to do credit card hacking I get it and it's fun to just learn new skills I I get that but I have found that um it's very difficult to turn off the grind mindset and to become much more calm and run things like a CEO not a hustler I find this is true a lot with personal finance people I know people who are worth a lot of money and they still do credit card hacks and if we look at how much they make it's a negligible amount like I do it because I cannot turn the page on what got me here and I don't realize that what got me here won't get me to the next level so part of fighting for Simplicity is that as you advance up whether it be finan finially relationally Etc there're things that you simply cannot afford to do anymore so I C I would not afford to be able to open up 10 new credit cards to save a total of $1,800 per year that does not compute for what I'm trying to save and invest and my time that's a so that's very important to know as you advance you probably got to stop doing certain things that got you here and think about what is the new chapter of my life you're the man thank you for doing this and than Sam always a pleasure man when's the book officially out the book is officially out January 1st oh sick all right two day two or three days um thank you for doing this you're the man we appreciate [Music] you for

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
what's up Sam hey you like the uh you like the fit where did you get that our boys at Jambi sent it over the no small boy stuff Christmas [Music] edition you know it's pretty funny I actually used the phrase no small boy stuff like kind of a lot yeah I remember the guy who tweeted it I think his name was Bengali 87 and this was back in 2022 he said best business business/ entrepreneurship podcast out there big money that is no small boy stuff I loved that and that's basically the phrase that we use for this podcast a lot no small boy stuff but frankly I kind of use it a lot in my life like I don't know man that's small boy kind of stuff like it's sort of like in succession where they say you're not a very serious person it's kind of like that I also use the phrase but I never say it cuz saying it to me feels so cringe but I think it like a thousand times for every one time that I say it and every one time I say it it feels so awkward to me it's like saying it's like saying just do it in the Nike slogan way or something like you don't really want to say that hey guys yeah this you in the fourth quarter we just Nike baby just do it and then they'll be like what why are you saying slogans at us but I do think it a lot it's actually meaningfully affected the trajectory of my life is to use this phrase and CU there so many situations where there's like a little small boy response o I'll I'll behave like a little small boy in this situation or I'll do it yeah that phrase and uh what AMJ said recently about what will make the better story that has had a fairly meaningful change just in you know it's only been a few weeks but like I I think about that actually a lot he also said something else where he was talking about he was basically so comfortable with this like 10e plus Odyssey that he's been on building this and we're like wow you've been doing this for so long and wow you did this for years before you had really any recognition or any funding and he just kept going and he was just like yeah I persist and he was just like get that he's like I think that's what I do he's like I I I didn't really think about it that consciously but like I'm pretty comfortable pushing the boulder for a long time up the mountain and I go I realized like I guess that's my like competitive Advantage like I'm in it for the long haul and I'll just persist it's like and we were both like small like a quick intake of breath what do you want to start with today all right I got a good story for you so there's this great Nim taleb quote or tweet where he taleb who wrote uh Black Swan and antifragile he's kind of this like contrarian thinker a successful hedge fund investor but he was successful because he had an interesting life philosophy and then he became like a a thinker is that his story I believe so I believe so I believe he's like a successful Trader and part of his success unless I'm mixing him up with somebody else part of his success was that he he noted Noti that humans are um we would rather win frequently in small amounts and then lose a bunch when we're wrong it's like gambling it's like playing craps right uh you know one roll of dice you made a little money two rolls of dice you WI a little bit money but eventually you roll a seven and it wipes out the entire board all of the chips go away but he's like humans are more comfortable with that versus he was willing to L bleed a little every day and look stupid every day for years but then when the his big you know sort of like the big short when his big bet pays off and this contrarian bet pays off he makes back all the money in one day got it and I I think that's his story if it's not his story his book is talking about the guy who does that so I can't recall if it's him or if he's the author or he's the author and the the the hero of the story a lot of people know that answer put it in the comments if you if you know okay so he uh TB tweeted this thing he goes I conjecture that if you gave an investor the next day's news 24 hours in advance he would go bust in less than a year here and this is basically the Back to the Future premise right so I don't if remember the movie Back to the Future but what's his name Biff or whatever Biff he finds uh like the sports betting book that tells all the winners for the next decade ofly he goes back in time and then he's just becomes a gazillionaire because he knows the scores um okay so like let's take yes if you knew the exact score you'd have to be pretty dumb to not win what these guys did and what theim tbba saying is I could give you the news so not the price change but I could give you the news and I bet you would trade in correctly dude I think about this all the time by the way all the time I think if I know what I know today but I was 10 or 50 years ago how would I capitalize on that I think about that all the time right and you know usually the easy answers for that are I just buy Bitcoin I just buy Google right like yeah it would actually wouldn't be that hard if you if you could convince yourself hey do this one thing and just shut up and trust me like don't don't touch it for 15 years now what these guys did was a little bit of a different experiment so what they did was they took 118 as they called them adults trained in finance and they did the crystal ball test and the crystal ball test was as follows they said we're going to give you money so they gave him $50 each so they said you have 50 bucks and you get to place trades and you're going to trade but we're going to before you make a trade we're going to show you the front page of the Wall Street Journal the actual front page of the Wall Street Journal from 15 random days in the last like I think 20 years or something that okay so 15 random days we're going to show you the front page of the Wall Street Journal and that's a Wednesday Edition and you're going to place the trade that would execute on the Tuesday so the day before that news so you had the news at 24 hours in advance they blacked out the stock prices so they wouldn't just show you oh Johnson Johnson's up 20% right but they would say like there would be the headline about Johnson and Johnson they would just redact the actual stock price Johnson and Johnson beats earnings beats earnings exactly record J record unemployment record jobs posting fed indicates blah blah blah right things like that and by the way anybody can go play this game online there's like a link to it we'll put it in the show notes but you can go actually do it yourself I did it too now there's a couple other caveats to this when you go do it which is it's not just a Buy and Hold because what I was going to do I went and did the thing I was like oh cool this is news from 15 years ago I'll just put all my money in buy and I won't trade uh I won't do anything else for the next 15 years I know there was a bull market so I don't need to be smart but the way that test was designed was the trade executes and you either go up or down that day so it's kind of like the trade closes that day you know what I mean you get one day gain based on the one day news Okay so they do it and uh the results are not good as you might expect otherwise I wouldn't really talk about this so the results are not good half the players lost money even having been given the news uh one out of every six players lost everything and the way they lost everything was they they let you trade on Leverage so you can trade up to like 20x Leverage if you want to in this thing like an options Trader could or you could just trade or you could skip you don't even have to trade any given day you could just say pass I I don't I don't feel confident an example headline would be like an example trade would be they would see something that says like uh fed has got a cut rate today I guess you would assume that the index is going to go up like a couple percent so you would bet on the index or bet on what it's basically the S&P 500 or it's uh the B the 30-year treasury so you best best you bet on one of those two things you bet you buy the SP index for that day or you could um short a bond you go long or short or you can go long or short the bond right so that's uh let me just show you an example so like this is the Wall Street Journal that they the article that they show you so it's uh Obama does something um and then you see this business and finance section and talks about rubert Murdoch Chesapeake Energy says that their CEO is going to step down auto sales are up Homeland Security says blah blah blah right so there's all this there's all this news so you then go here and you place a trade so you say all right I'm going to go in this in this little game here you can see my screen where it gave me a million dollars so I'm going to trade and it says today's movement I you know I bet a million dollars so I used my full stack uh with no leverage and um the day was up 62% so I got an extra6 $6,200 right then it gives me the next one and it says oh there's a there's a deadly plane crash Iran is doing some [ __ ] okay cool blah blah blah as in talks to acquire um this Brazilian company and they're just blacking out any of the stock price news right so you read this and you can decide what you want to do and you do that over and over and over again so 15 15 days in history and they tried to do it as 15 like they did a third of the days where like fed quarterly meeting days a third was jobs reports and a third was complete Randomness um and they didn't they're like we're not trying to trick you there's no uh we're not like cherry picking like misleading days these are just actually like random front from pages okay okay this is an awesome experiment hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas these are business ideas that you could create using Ai and it's a list of 200 they did a huge brainstorm so you can check it out if you just click the link below you can get access to these 200 AI ideas uh I'll give you an example of a couple of them one of them is you can build an AI dressing room so let's say you go to an e-commerce site and you want to see what something would look like on you you can use AI to actually take a picture of you and show you what the clothes would look like on you or what the makeup would look like on your face it's pretty cool right um or AI tools for real estate brokers maybe something that takes their listings and makes them more more fancy more more more beautiful and attract more buyers so check it out it's a brainstorm of 200 possible AI ideas brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below okay so back to the results now so um like I said half the people lose the money one out of six lose everything CU they got over leverage the average person was only able to gain 3.2% so even being given the news during that era the market was up on average I think 15% a year over the last 15 years I don't know when this was done correct correct but again these are like one- day trades right so you know you're not just like buying and holding for oh it was for 15 days the experiment was a 15-day experiment exactly and the and so okay now why right there's two ways you can lose in in investing one is you bet wrong meaning you pick the wrong direction you think think it's going up it actually goes down so basically even given the news they were basically only able to bet the direction correctly 51% of the time so it's the same as if you know you just flipped a coin you would have been right the same amount of times as you were being given the actual front page of the Wall Street Journal okay so information doesn't lead to actual Insight um especially news the second thing is that uh why did they do poorly um they bet sized very poorly so when you had an advant even when you were people didn't size up their bets enough and when they're incorrect they sized up their bets too much for the level of con conviction that they had um and you know this doesn't go in line with what people think so they surveyed people and separately and basically 70% of people thought that even if they got the news you know sort of like like basically they thought that even four-week old stale news would be predictive and um you know 70% of people thought that but but in this case it just showed that even you know one day fresh news doesn't even really help you okay so then they went and they did an extra experiment they go okay maybe those 118 you know Financial trained adults maybe they're just not the best of the best so they went and try to find the best of the best the best of the best actually did better so they went and found five people that were you know hedge fund guy the head of trading at a top five Bank uh seasoned macro Traders so they are used to trading on this type of news they're considered the best in the world at this and they actually did better so what they did was all of them finished with gains so all five finished with gains on average they were up 130% and they also didn't bet on one out of every three news things the one of the big ways that they were better was they just didn't bet all the time whereas the Casual was too active okay what else did the pro do differently they were only right 6% more so you know if the um I think if the the the the the test group was right 51% of the time if it's going up or down these guys were only right 57% of the time it wasn't like they correctly interpreted it but when they were right they bet size properly and they never risked too much of their bankroll to where they couldn't recover and so isn't that amazing that you know only being you know 6 to 10% better at your predictive ability but would yield a much bigger result right 3% average gain for the test group 130% average gain for the for the pros so it's these small edges that can make a huge difference when you apply leverage properly which was the the BET sizing and what's the takeaway that Nasim Nasim um said which is which is what well he was saying it in a polarizing way he goes I conjecture if you gave an investor the next day's news he would go bust and less than a year um and and this kind of this basically showed that one out of six would go bust because they would get overzealous around this perceived Edge that doesn't exist and on the whole most people would just do worse than if they if they didn't have the news it's no better than random right that's actually one of his books Fooled by Randomness um and at the end they use this quote by Ray doio in there is a great quote it goes He Who lives by the crystal ball will die eating shattered glass dude that's insane like that's it's weird that multiple smart people come to that conclusion that I never would have come to like I I would have thought like I I guess everyone have thought that if you know the future or you know the news you absolutely are going to out perform exactly exactly the counterintuitive wise conclusion um let me tell you one one other related one so there was one other uh story here that was kind of interesting there was a real world version of this where a hacking group got access they hacked the press release system so they had access to the next day's press releases that companies put out when they have like major announcements earnings results Etc they got access to all of the press releases that were coming out the next day and they were using it as like their own form of like you know home brewed Insider information right they were able to get Insider information and so they could place a bet in the market overnight or the next morningly that's like a 12h hour leading indicator maybe because like if you're um if you're going to fire your CEO you submit the press release maybe at 5: or 6:00 p.m. on a on a Thursday and then 9:00 a.m. on Friday you announce it or or the the wire goes live something I don't know the exact timing I would imagine that it's a it's a tighter window than that because there's too much leakage but even a 12 second Advantage would be in a a huge Advantage if you knew 12 seconds ahead of time what the news was about to be you could just push the button right that's all you got to do that's like an interesting like uh you know like HubSpot for example whenever they have a that I'm a shareholder of whenever they have like an earnings I like I know when it's going to go live that day so someone is like writing that and they've submitted it to I forget what the pr what the thing's called it's the popular PR newswire whatever yeah like whatever the popular thing is that is kind of an I did I never even realized that actually that's why there's rules right when I was at Amazon you couldn't trade the stock in a there's a window there's like a frozen window so X days before the announcement you can't make any trades oh I know that but I'm saying the employees of the pr um oh right right right I think they probably have the same right I I didn't even think about that as a leakage I tell you when I when I accidentally did that trade and then I had to go to the what were they like you're an idiot uh so I I'm like I've learned about this afterwards right I'm a startup kid I don't know anything about this we get acquired I you know I make a trade and then I'm like oh [ __ ] and I'm at so we're at a subsidiary of Amazon right you bought Amazon before you sold to Amazon I bought Amazon stock I bought more Amazon stock or something or I sold some am I don't remember what it was and I um I was like oh [ __ ] I just did I just inside our trade did I just get my hands dirty with a little big boy business and so I'm like oh [ __ ] what do I do they're like you need to go speak to the general counsel and I was like what and I get a meeting with the general counsil urgent urgent possible possible big money move made and I send the email they get me a meeting SN stat I go in and he's like so what what happened and I was like I went and made a trade you know I'm in the window and you know I'm an executive so handcuff Me Take Me Away Bo me up I'm a bad boy I'm a bad I've been a bad boy take me away and uh she's like so how much did you and I was like I was like yeah it was like 150 Grand and he was like it's okay just uh my lunch is outside can you bring it in before you leave he was like this is for actual execs at the actual company who make actual trades I was like okay got gotcha gotcha gotcha let me go sit down that's actually hilarious he just like totally dismissed you um but what about let me finish the story about the hackers so let's put you let's let's test your criminal mastermind which I love I love doing by the way how would I how would I cheat if I was going to by the way you know that it's always the women always think to themselves how would I get away from this bad person trying to hurt me and the men always think in this in the they align with the criminal how I be the bad person yeah like how would I get away with this crime that's like a I I I realize that after watching a lot of True Crime and so go ahead I like this experiment so you're the hackers you get this but here's the problem you they're like Sam we got it we hacked him you know Dave over here in the corner did it he got into the we got Rude access and they print out all of the press releases coming out but they put it on your desk they're like hey we got like an hour we got to make a trade and now there's 60,000 press releases on your desk what do you do I guess pick like a random five and hold and and and act on those as soon as yeah I mean it's that's that's a very challenging situation I guess it's a it's a challenging pick the the first five and if it's good news buy the stock if it's bad news somehow short it but I don't even know how to do that so I guess I would only find like the five good news ones right you're like I think I would still just end up holding the index fun Vanguard I think I just stay doing exactly what I always do 802 stocks and bonds baby so what what they ended up doing was they were like all you you sort of need to do a search function to figure out what news affects the price the most in a positive or negative Direction and um I think what they figured out was that it was merger announcements that would be the highest kind of like volatility for the company that was getting acquired because it almost always gets acquired at like a 50% premium to the where the stock was trading and so I think what they realized was we need to be able to quickly discard 98% of the news and information because it's noise right which goes back to the same experiment right the most of the news information is noise the secret is figureing out what is actually signal and most of us can't do that and we overestimate our ability to figure out signal versus noise and so they um they figured out the signal it was these merger things and they even they were only right in their predictive ability about 70 something perent of the time it was enough to make hundreds of millions of dollars very quickly before they got caught for doing this and then they all went to jail but Isn't that cool also that's the ending when we sold the Hub when we sold the HubSpot I think the share price I think it was $350 and then like the week they announced it it went to like $460 just something like this anyone can go back and look at it it was February of 21 and damn Sam the needle mover over here well I so that that stock price went up like I guess it's a market cap of like one or two billion dollars and I remember going to Kip the CMO I go H you're welcome he's like oh yeah it was this acquisition that got mentioned one time in our earnings call it just barely it wasn't the fact that we had just announced that we grew by 45% and have been compounding growth of like this this this and uh I was like yeah yeah causation is difficult to prove I agree yeah I'm like you don't understand um can I tell you all right so we two or three years ago we talked about AI girlfriends I sort of understood it because I like have actually developed like pretty good friendships mostly via text messages I think a lot of people who have group messages here uh feel the same way I didn't entirely understand it but in the last two or three months I've been using chat gbt in a way that now I'm like yeah if this would go away I would be very upset and I understand why people were very upset when they're when they're AI girlfriends replica got when they did like a software update yeah and so it basically I've been using chat gbt as like my thought partner slash assistant slash therapist and you actually said something recently that made it a lot better so I sat down and I'll explain how I've used it but I sat down and I said hey uh can you ask me all the questions that a therapist or life coach or an executive coach would ask and we could spend a few hours with just me downloading giving you a download on my life and I did that and since then it's been magical and I've been using it for all types of purposes I use it all day and and I want to maybe explain to you how I'm using it maybe you could explain to me if you are doing the same which I think you are and how you're using it right by the way I'll just give you a quick one my prompt that I used yesterday for this I said I I was explaining the situation I go ask me a few questions one at a time then when you feel you have enough info then try to give me a suggestion because otherwise it just tries to like you know man you know like mansplaining or what is it called when like guys hear like your girlfriend is explaining something to you you're trying to fix the problem right away she's like no I'm not trying to get the fix right now I just want you to hear me and understand me and you're like what like I thought you just want the answer as fast as possible shoved in your throat and like that's what chat GPD does by default it's it's yeah and there's a bunch of other downsides that I I want to explain to all this and how I'm working around it but first I'm using it for a variety of things so I'm using it for personal finance stuff and I'll give an example for each and a second I'm using it for business questions I'm using it as like a sparring thought partner of like I'm thinking about doing this what's your opinion I'm using it as a therapist of like you know I'm struggling with this person at work or my personal life how should I handle this or what should my life goals be and I'm also using it for help me me decide which task so I'll give you an example so for net worth I use kuara kubara is like a net worth tracker you just log in with your bank accounts and all your other accounts in it tells you your net worth whatever well they actually have a feature where you can download the information specifically for chat gbt and you upload it and it doesn't have any identifying information it's not like it has passwords it just has a bunch of numbers and so you can I will upload this to chat gbt and I'll say things like you know I I like to be conservative like um what would you rate this portfolio out of 10 of risk or you know like what's your opinion on it like what would Warren Buffett say you can ask it all types of questions like that or you can also say like uh you know how much should I spend on a house or what will my net worth be in 20 years like things like that and it's been actually really amazing another thing that I did was I took the main kpis for my company and I uploaded it to it and I'll be like what are the needle moving things that I can do for this company and you could do your kpis which is typically like an exp Excel spreadsheet like your company's churn new users things like that you can also do your company financials and then another thing that I've been doing is I will actually take screenshots of my calendar and I'll upload it and be like what task should I be doing for the next week the next month the next quarter to get to the goals that I've told you about you know my life goals which by the way you helped me create you helped me create quarterly and annual goals how should I be spending my time today tomorrow next week and next and it will it gives me an agenda that I literally print out and I work according to that it's like pretty wild and that's how I've been using it and then all day I'll be like um how should I reply to this email what's your opinion it's kind of crazy so that's how I've been using it it's like you have neuralink they just never did the surgery right like you're basically putting AI like as the you know operator in your brain in many ways but you're just like you know we just haven't reached that Tech point where the chip is already implanted well the next step of that is here's what's going to happen there's going to be software it probably exists and I'm tinkering with a few of them that records your computer screen your phone screen the words that you say out loud the things you type and it's going to and it's going to give you feedback on how you spent your day it's going to give you feedback on what to do things like that so it's going to like you know how they there's a book I forget what the book is but the premise is Google knows more than you because you are more honest in your Google searches than you are when you talk to your spouse or your friends or whatever the same thing happens where it's like yeah you know I I spend this much time working on this this and this be like no you did not spend that much time do it and also you told me that you're trying to be nicer you wrote like eight really mean emails do you know what I mean like that's how it's going to be in the next six months I think there's going to be products like that that are actually nailing that yeah I think the uh the CEO of Microsoft um I don't know if you heard this story but I guess when Balmer stepped down and they needed a new CEO um and at the time Microsoft was kind of in a Down W downward to Flat it was just uninspired stock and Company at the time so they needed something and I don't know if you heard the story so the guy who became the CEO sadella actually wrote a a memo like I wrote a kind of like a a Manifesto an internal Manifesto about like what what M what Microsoft needs to do and he ends up getting the job and at the time it was like he's like I didn't he's like I never thought I'd be the CEO of Microsoft like you know you join Bill Gates as a CEO or whatever and then Balmer and he just they're always going to bring in somebody but they actually promoted him from within and um he um he wrote this thing and one of the key principles that he wrote in this this was a while back when he what year like 05 or 10 or something this was in 2014 so um he wrote uh he be bet on two things I don't remember the second one but I remember the first one he called ambient intelligence and ambient intelligence is kind of what you're describing which is basically like um how do you have have you know computer intelligence artificial intelligence but just like kind of on amb like kind of in your in your environment so that it can be helpful to you so it just knows what you need without you having to go fetch it without you having to go ask specifically it can either anticipate it it can be aware of all of your context so that you don't have to like first explain the whole situation and then be able to just ask your question it already knows your situation so you could just ask the question that sort of thing and so Isn't that cool that he uh you know like so long before uh and you know opening eye wasn't even Incorporated at that point or something like that this is this is a very long time ago so um to bet on that as like one of the two like ways that the tech Puck is going um pretty baller which is shockingly hard by the way it's hard to make these predictions and remove like The Limited part of your brain and just imagine like yeah but what would be what would be amazing you know like what would be cool if it then that's actually that sounds easy it's really hard cuz you constantly think like well I can't do that you know like because that's impossible or that would cost too much money like there's all these limits but the way that I've been using this like if like it it doesn't work perfect yet though by the way this is like there's a a few issues with this and I'm like super not technical the first thing is contextual or context Windows like the more you talk to it it doesn't always learn more you actually it runs out of memory in a weird way and uh and so I've been testing like a variety of different platforms Gemini versus um chat gbt but I want to use chat gbt because I think it's going to be around the longest and they're going to innovate the fastest but it's not perfect at all but it's like shocking how useful this is I finally for a long time I'm like yeah AI is great like I can look just like Google a stat and it's going to tell me but now it's more like this is my life like I am using this more than anything and so like they had their new $200 a month thing come out and I don't even think I need the features but I'm like whatever I'll take it and so I like contemplated contemplating like should I like invest a little bit of money into like building out these systems just for my personal operating system and like making my life great and keep in mind I don't know anything about any of this [ __ ] I just know that it's it's just effective like it just literally is helping me get my day done better and it's like a great bit of advice I like here's a really another like practical way I mean you I'll upload my measurements for my body and I'll be like find me clothes that fit or like does this fit does this uh pair of pants fit and you just like post a link like I just I've been using it constantly I guess how are you if you are using it to be like this like sparring thought partner yeah yeah well I think this is the key so um so what what we're saying is basically the way that I think by default people will use this is you ask a question it gives an answer and actually a equally if not more powerful way is to do the exact opposite you basically say I have a I'm trying to think about this ask me questions and and then you and you get it to ask you the questions and then in that way it's your sparring partner it is your thought partner in like kind of fleshing out or or getting your own Clarity around a situation and it's available 24/7 it doesn't judge it's it's you know super super intelligent but also has like you know empathy you can you can go back and forth instantly it's always available um and there's no lag time right it's better than a friend right you know you have a friend who you [ __ ] to and you're like I just need a vent and like just give me like what should I do here but you kind of feel guilty like laying on them are making it all about you and like they don't quite understand exactly what you're talking about this is just that person but better it's one of the main reasons why coaches and therapists are great because you're like cool we're going to have a completely one-way conversation here like I I don't got to give you nothing I can come here and be a taker and that's the arrangement and like you know I gave you the money that's what that was for and now from there on out I don't need to consider your feelings in this interaction that sounds like ruthless but it's true it's why it's different than just just talking to a friend where as a friend you got to be like sorry am I taking up too much of your time I don't mean to put all this on you you know you're like you're always trying to like kind of half apologize and then reciprocate and one of the cool things about a therapist or a coach is like that's not the social contract that's not what's expected in that situation AI is even better it's like hey start to bug you at 1:00 a.m I just I'd like to talk right now and i' like instant responses with complete intelligence and I'll just keep saying no tell me you know no try again until I get something that's satisfactory to me it's like you couldn't even treat a human like that right so it's pretty great to be able to do that it's become strange I call it dude sometimes I'm like dude what's your problem that's wrong stop getting these like like uh like it's it's it's it's strange because if you think about it when you're texting your friends like it's because it's like in the same window or next to the same window on your computer like you kind of forget that this is a machine and you can train it how to talk it's very strange but it's actually quite effective do you know how an llm Works no you know what like deep learning is so I went and watched some videos the other just to get like cuz I was like how is this magic magicking what is going on here there's one by this guy I think it's called like three brown one blue is like his his username or something like that it's got millions of views and he explains you know uh Mach like what is deep learning which is like the technique that worked with AI and the second thing was uh you know how large language models work what does it even mean what is large what is the language model what ises that what does that even do but check this out so okay like here's the example that that that I gave Okay so this is me not even trying to explain to you what it is cuz my explanation is going to be pretty bad this is me just saying I can't believe that this is what actually is happening I cannot fathom that this is the actual scenario okay so let's take this example I wrote this I put this on a card cuz like I can't forget this I'll never forget what I learned all right so imagine this number seven right so let's say you're trying to train AI to be able to see that this is seven how do you do that you can hardcode it but well every time you see the number seven it's like a capture right it's like written a little bit differently so it's like you can't just say this is exactly a seven cuz you write your seven slightly different than me maybe you put a little line through it maybe you have a little angle to It Whatever right so you just want it to be able to recognize anybody's handwriting and figure out seven or not seven right what number is it so how does it work so imagine basically um a classroom okay so here's um a row of kids so there's 10 kids standing there and each of the 10 kids is um like holding one of these cards with a different number on it right but actually it doesn't have the whole number so um or actually they have the whole number but for at first it just says all right there's a whole index card we got to figure out we don't even know if this is a seven or a dog or a car it could be anything right so it just Zooms in and it says let's look at this little section right here like these 20 pixels okay these 20 pixels um you know on this area it's white so if you got color there sit down kids anybody who's got color over here sit down cuz this picture is white over here can't be can't be you you're eliminated and then over here it's like hey there's some blue ink something is here so if you got blue ink in this little section um stay standing if you don't sit down right so that like eliminates a bunch of you know like kind of thought processings so then it passes it to the next layer the next layer of 10 kids and it says all right uh who here's got this flat line okay so the the seven stay standing the five stay standing you know the threes are kind of like hey we got some stuff up here up top the eights but you know the four the number four doesn't have a little roof on top so it's like I'm out I'm out you're like okay go sit down it's like paintball right you're out go go to sit on the side and then so now you're left with like you know some of the numbers and then it says all right we got a little little stick over here who's got a stick over there and it's like the threes are like oh I'm out now that's not me but the sevens and the fives are like Hey we're still in it might be us Right Bingo and so you just keep passing it from layer to layer showing it like kind of more pixels on the screen and it's trying to get with some level of confidence at the end right it's going to be seven and maybe five at the end and the Seven's like yo I'm 90% sure it's me and the five is like yeah it's maybe 10% that it's me it's just an ugly five and then that's how the AI knows that this is a seven because it passes it from layer to layer to layer to layer looking at the pixels on the screen and basically trying to figure out trying to guess is it is it one of you I think with some probability it's this okay that's just recognizing a number okay now imagine what you're doing you're giving it kpis of your company it has to understand what a kpi is what a company is that you looking for strategy what strategy sounds like it's got to say something that you as a successful business person who sold your companies for you know tens of millions of dollars that you will respect the output of this like isn't that mindblowing that that's even a thing and so that now you take how does that work so it now you take instead of the seven take an example where it's like the dog blank right so it's like what's going to come after you know it basically sees a sentence the dog uh or the dog it's like what's a dog and what are they commonly do it doesn't even even know that it has no idea what a dog is there no meaning it just has it read the whole internet so what they did was they were like hey go read the whole internet which like if you or I we were like yo Sam I got to like let's do this man we could do this we're going to take so much ad roll we'll stay up all night and we're going to read 24/7 all the text on the internet it would be like thousands of years before we could ever in just what you know what they gave it in one training run right so they said go read all the internet cool done all right now user puts in a sentence the dog blank guess what guess what the next token is guess what the next little word is that comes after the dog the dog it's like the dog barked the dog jumped the dog you know is hungry right whatever it could be like one of many things so then it takes the next word which might be like the dog barked and then it passes that phrase back through it's like now you got the phrase the dog barked what comes after that and it just Loops that over and over again to generate the next word so that's when you see chat GPT writing it's literally taking like the the next token it thinks it should say then it feeds it back through and then says okay well if I said if I said the dog barked then I got to say loudly right okay loudly period uh if I said the dog bark loudly what would I say next and then it would it would keep and it keeps recursively doing that and that's what's actually that's how it it generates a training thing right that and that's like you know this is only part of it half explained correctly but let's assume for a second that I'm not like completely misinterpreting this let's assume for a second that this is only you know a percentage of what what is actually going on right there's still parameters and weights and all this other stuff that I talked about yet this is like God right this is like what like how is this even a thing it's so mind-blowing to me it's mindblowing it's absolutely mind-blowing and I think that um you know I think Young you know I don't hang around like 18-year- olds I think they're using it for school so I think they get it I think I know a a little bit about it because I hang out with smart people and I'm on the outskirts of like what these guys are doing so I kind of see it online and I play with it for the average Joe for my mom and dad for a 35-year-old who isn't like tech savvy who just works as a mechanic I don't think that they're using it this way I don't think they're using it at all and it's going to change everything it's just like so like crazy like when the average Joe starts getting into this I think young people like a 21-year-old or something I think it's like changing schools by the way it's like the grading system is like totally effed up yeah like when I like think about this I'm like like this is like there is no homework you can't do homework anymore you know what I mean someone dm' me yesterday it's not just homework someone dm' me last night they were showing me um Sky Oliver Oliver Han he texted me this thing or dm' me this thing he said uh coding interviews like so okay you school yeah kids in school are using chat write essays and the teachers are like [ __ ] how do we how are we get it's a cat and mouse game to try to be like hey how do I stop you from using AI to just like do your assignments well the same thing is true for coding interviews so coding interviews which are used to hire programmers there's this website leap codewizard doio and basically it just helped you cheat on your coding interview it's like oh you got a coding test to get a job just use this watch it'll it'll it's the same thing as a student it'll write the essay for you basically and uh it's like you know doing 15 grand a month and recurring revenue of just helping people cheat on coding interviews this is insane it's so difficult right uh but it's kind of amazing how are you using this every day um like let me just go to chat gbt just tell you like my last is chat gbt your tool of choice or do you like any of the other ones yeah it is my like default and then you know I play with everything else so usually if I'm like how factually correct does this need to be I'll perplexity so I go to perplexity if it's analysis I'll use chap like if you use like the 01 stuff like the deeper thinking stuff only for 24 or 48 Hours yeah it's brand new but yeah it's it's wild it takes a long time but it's wild well yeah that's the point of it it's basically if you told the computer hey you don't have to just quickly like again shove an answer down my throat and instantaneously where you're just predicting the next token and uh good enough to go right there 70% chance it's this word let's just put it in they found they could get you could do more interesting tasks if you just said hey just take your time before you answer just give it more time to think and then it'll come up with a better answer it's temperamental which is amazing um so I use that but like check this out so there was this um press release recently for uh we were talking about IVF remember well there's kind of this amazing thing I don't know if you saw it's called futilo do you see what happened with this thing called futilo so basically it was like the first live birth using eggs that matured outside the body so like if you've done IVF it's it's like a pretty expensive and pretty like harsh thing on the body like the woman has to get like injections which are hormone injections to try to get your they're trying to get your eggs to essentially um mature be produced and mature inside your body and so what fertil did was they were like cool instead of doing that like long expensive sort of hard your body process we can take an immature egg take it out of the body and let's do the hormones hormone stuff out of the body and get it to mature and then we'll put it back in the body and so it just like removes the um the pain from from the process and the first like actual live birth happened of a baby that was born using that procedure it's kind of amazing if true it's going to make you know it's going to change IVF uh you know it's going to make it where I don't know if it'll just be called a new procedure or what but basically for you know a fraction of the cost a fraction of the time and a fraction of the pain we can do the thing that we've been doing with IVF okay so dude it makes me realize that um I think that sahill uh I forget his last name from gumroad tweeted this like thing out where everyone made fun of him where he talked about how he's like giving birth is not going to happen in the future you're just going to um be in this sack and that's how you're going to grow this is that I'm like oh [ __ ] you're right you know what I mean I remember we were at a dinner and Jess Ma just said it casually in passing she was like yeah like you I'm really you know excited for and fascinated by uh uh basically like artificial wombs and basically you know preg you know you won't give women won't give birth at a certain point right it'll be like riding horses for transport it's like you you could do it if you if you want to go have a unique experience it it won't be necessary and she's like pass pass the mashed potatoes and you're like wait wait wait wait wait so no like like literally that's exactly what happened and I was like and at the table I looked to be like was anybody else mind blown by that well what's going on like don't we all want more information about that but I at I was at this like far diagonal seven PE people away but I heard her say it and I'm stuck over here talking about Facebook ads with some dork and I'm like H just want to get out of this side of the table get to that side of the table so after the dinner Jess what did you say about wombs no literally I flagged her down I was like oh you're getting an Uber hey cancel that real quick and she canceled it and I was like um what was that thing you were talking about and then she explained and she explained the companies that she's tracking and like where we are in the scientific life cycle of of like how real is that possibility and how what are the laws of physics is that inevitable or is it impossible right cuz basically if something is not impossible it's inevitable which in itself is kind of a dope idea um right like that already kind of blows my mind and so she was explaining it so you know I've sort of been paying attention to any signs of movement in that area because I think that's really cool the world's going to change pretty dramatically when that happens um but what I did back to the AI thing I just threw the press release into chat and I said explain this article to me tell me what they're saying tell me what this means in simple terms it's a press release and so it might be misleading or overstating the success of this so tell me about that too and then it just goes here's what it means in simpler terms this company has achieved what they call the world's first a healthy baby born with a woman's egg that was matur out every body normally in IVF the doctors are doing ABC in this scenario what they're doing is ABC and then it explains it and it goes in simpler terms conventional path is X the new approach is why why it matters if this is true blah blah blah blah and then it says here's why it might be misleading it's a press release so it's definitely spin number two one success doesn't prove a trend it talks about the world's first but it doesn't mention how many others they've tried that have failed in the hit rate of this procedure it's not peer reviewed it might be exaggerating the future impact um we would need to know clinical trials blah blah blah and then you know then I asked it more I was like cool what is the what does the scientific literature say about this so all of a sudden I'm getting like a quick biology lesson uh another one brainstorming name ideas for a project I'm like hey here's the project it's great for that ask me questions about the project and then come up with names and it comes up with dorky names I'm like no make the names not dorky and long and don't make it feel like it's written by chat GPT make it feel like it's written by David Olie and then it like comes up with different answers a lot of financial analysis so analyzing stocks or just like yo I see Kathy Wood on my screen a lot like is she actually like great at investing and then AI is like talk like a monkey I see Kathy Wood on my screen is she just hot or good at trading right it's like you know I'm asking these questions and again no judgment just gives me the answers which was spoiler no she underperforms the indexes and has over like a 15year period and makes a100 million a year to underperform the index it's like wow uh good on you Kathy Wood you know for for for doing that um let's see just other ones hey I'm trying to do this in Excel but I don't know how to do it can you just tell me the function I need to write in cuz like you know if you go Google this stuff you get like YouTube videos you have to watch yeah so now I'm like all right forget the YouTube video just give me the like the exact type thing I need to go type in or I'll screenshot the Excel Window and I'll just say I'm trying to figure out in column C what are the ones blah blah blah blah and it gives me this like complicated you know whatever countifs formula that's multiple like selectors or whatever oh I play games with my kids so we take pictures of like my son got all these sharks so we just took a picture picture cuz he's asked me questions right like d what is this shark and I'm like dude [ __ ] if I know right like and you know it was kind of like something I always dreaded as a parent it's like oh cool my kid's going to ask me questions that I you know where does rain come from and I'm like it's in the clouds it's like how did it get in the clouds I'm like I think it was in the ocean and then it just like zipped up there cuz it was hot or something and like I'm like ah this is going to be terrible I'm going to expose myself and so I just do chat GPT voice mode and I will be like I'll send it a picture and I'll go voice mode I'll be like hey uh tell me what these sharks are from left to right and it reads it out to my kids and then my kid can ask a question he'll be like which one is the strongest shark and it it'll be like actually the great white shark is the strongest shark with the most powerful bite and he'll be like no but what if it was with a cheetah and he'd be like well a cheetah wouldn't be in the ocean but if it was in the ocean and like it'll like interact with my kids and we have like a fun time they'll they'll tell me all the time can we play with AI dude that's so good I've got a bunch of friends whose children are like three four five talking age and they like are doing the exact same thing we do trivia another hack for parents you can go hey I'm sitting here with my two kids their names are you know whatever Timmy and Tommy and um we're gonna we want to do Paw Patrol trivia ask us easy questions and when we're right say dingding ding and when we're wrong say that's not right try again and keep track of the scores all right go literally you could just say that to it in voice mode and it would be like all right first question Marshall is a pup known for what and you're like fire and it's like ding ding ding correct 1 kids are going to like fall love with with with her like it it's pretty crazy uh how like imagine being you know raised with this this is insane the I'll give you let me give three practical ways I'm using it so they have this new thing called I think it's newi is called projects and so I have three folders right now and the way it works is you have like a folder has a project and then you could upload files to the project and then you could have multiple conversations within the project and it refers back to the files or whatever information give me the example this like let me give an example there I have a health folder and so you know how everyone has like their own health Guru and it's like usually based off of like one book they read well I go and download B yeah well I go and I download the book that I ascribe to and I will upload and I if it's a book that's UB which is how I buy it on Kindle I convert it to text file because it's easier to read and I upload the text file uh to the even though it's like huge because it's a book that works I give it a full book I the full book download it and I convert it and then like so for example um we we're going to the grocery store uh today and I just said like you know there's like this interesting book I just read and I upload the I've uploaded the book and I'll just say make the grocery list for me um and and then I'll and I'll tell me actually uh and I'll say wh which grocery store should I go to um in my area and it knows where I live and it says yeah like these three grocery stores will have exactly what you need I think they will have what you need because like you know I'm on like clean meat kit pick or whatever and he was like yeah the author says like to buy this cut of meat and you should ask the butcher this this and this and like here's three butchers that appear to have what you need and it's all based off of like the files that I've uploaded uh for health uh but then within health I can ask it um it know I'll like hey this quarter I want to run a 5k at this particular time um give me like a good app to use that can help track my running and also tell me like what my goals should be so that's like a couple Health versions the second one is um I've got a clothing one where I literally took a photo of myself and I used a tape measur to measure various parts of my body and I upload it to it and I was like all right like make a chart with all my measurements thank you remember that always um here's some like clothing that I want to buy here's the links can you like go and figure out what size it is and let me like let fit and they like well this pants uh it says that they're the same width as your thigh but you actually want like 2 in usually uh extra width that they'll probably feel more comfortable or what I'll do is upload like a Blog that I like die work wear blog and I'll say hey um here's a picture I'll literally lay a tie next to a jacket and I'll take a picture of it and I'll upload it I'll be like does this tie match this jacket and I'll be like no but that other tie that you showed me a picture of a while ago that actually would look great here it's like that's how I use it and then the final way that I use it and this is like my life coach folder which is like it's like partially like I'll complain to it and be like you know I noticed you've been complaining about this a lot um or I'll upload business financials to it and that's like more of like my sparring partner throughout the day and so I have three folders right now Health uh clothing and like a life coach and so those are like the practical ways and I'm using projects that's the that's the term on chat gbt um and that's how I'm using it as of now D people are just going to replace their co-founder with with this right like you're going to see a lot more solo Founders because you could just have an AI co-founder you're going to say um well you know you'll reduce turn if you use this messaging when you email your users and then you're just going to say uh yeah well you have my log into MailChimp like or Shopify like go ahead yeah get it done or you'll be like you know my Shopify store uh it's like a 2.1 conversion rate and it's like hey I you know we ran this AB test uh it like increase your converion rate the 3% and you're like get after it you know go do it and that's what's going to happen and so anyway we've had these intelligent people daresh whatever explain to us all these things but it wasn't until the last two months and in fact recently actually since told me to ask him the ask chat to that question that like I'm like oh my god this is my life now and in fact you actually sent out a wonderful email the other day where you said here's how to ask powerful questions I uploaded that email to chat gbt and I'm like remember these questions and like ask me them often or ask yourself these questions often yeah I mean it's just so it's incredible and it's also so obvious that uh I think that chat GPT is I mean it is the Google of Our Generation and I guess the only question is like why am I not why am I not a shareholder of open AI like what how do I how do I go to sleep at night well I mean you Dar Mash had to buy a $10 million domain and then convince them to buy it in order to become a shareholder so like it's like like asking like there's always a way though there is always tried everything but that's like saying like why am I not a billionaire it's like well like you could be but like here's some of the barriers to entry that you've got to overcome so there's certainly you should ask chat GPT that by it's a good question by the way uh why am I not a billionaire it is a great question but like there have you have you ever asked yourself that question I asked a friend that question um and uh they weren't even really that close of a friend so it's kind of a you know it was a blunt question to ask at a dinner I was like why are you not already a billionaire um and he gave a great answer and he goes uh actually what he was saying was you know I want to start a billion dollar company something something something and and I was like why have you not already done that and he goes I think when I was starting these other companies that I started he because I didn't actually understand what a billion dollar company looked like and if I had known that I would have built the different company um and he was he was correct and and you know as we dug in it's like what makes a company a billion dollar company like you know there's really only a couple of paths to that and you know one of them for for example is uh like building something that has Network effect so he had been building companies that could do like great revenues that could be even be profitable they could grow fast you know those are some of the things you need but there was no network effect it was no durability there was no defensibility there was no like win the category it was like just go to a category where you can win inside that category but there will be other winners and you like just for as an example that was like a a gaming company it's like the a lot of mobile gaming companies and at the time like to build to to build a billion dollar gaming company require like you really had to be like one of the like you know three that were going to get built in a five-year window right like you had to build you know Clash of Clans or you had to build Candy Crush or you had to build like one of those and even in one of those it was like oh actually you know I'm sitting here tinkering on cool game designs and actually the thing I need to do is build a enormous paid marketing team that is like point the top the top paid marketers in the world to acquire hundreds of millions of customers is what I need to do and like the cool artsy game design that's going to win me Awards is not going to that's not what a billion dollar gaming company looks like so he just didn't understand the shape of something and I I find that that to be I find that to be true about most of the goals so instead of how can I do this goal another way of saying it is why have I not already done this goal why is it not already true for me and then it points out some like you know either knowledge gaps or execution gaps that are today um that that are like more more close to your timeline versus when you set like an ambitious goal that's like far in the future and you sort of bake in that it's going to take a long time um you sort of avoid the maybe the harsh realities that might be actually existing today in your world about those yeah you had a great email with a bunch of those questions it was here's a here's a bunch of decision-making questions which is I'm not sure I'm not sure what should I do instead you should say what would I do if I weren't afraid one bad question is how can I make this succeed the better question is what would make this certainly fail final example is I can't decide which path is the right to pick a better question or a better version of that is what path makes for the best story this was actually a uh a pretty good email I think I replied I said this was a 10 um but you had like a list of better questions and I used those questions in chat gbt because what you're what I'm learning with Chad gbt is you have to get it to ask you better questions in order to you know its input is important for its output and so yeah I pretty much stole that email yeah the I think the the realization was Tim first had said something way back I think I put it in the um in the email but he had he used this phrase he goes he was talking about it in the in the in the podcasting realm but first first he had this quote Yeah you read it out he goes if you want confusion and heartache ask vague questions if you want uncommon Clarity in results ask uncommonly C clear questions often all that stands between you and what you want is a better set of questions exactly and uh he said this about his podcast he goes I view questions as like a a pickaxe for the brain like you know like a pickaxe when you're summiting a mountain and you you you use it to sort of like uh pierce the the the side of the mountain and and use it to pull yourself up and so in many ways you are Excavating the brain with this pickaxe and your pickax is questions um another phrase I use all the time in businesses is ask a better question get a better answer so often if somebody asks a bad question and I'll call a bad question either a vague question an openend question or a question in the wrong direction um I think the rookie move is just to answer a question at face value like you should not answer 100% of the questions asked like a lot of the questions need to bounce back to sender oh this has the wrong address on it you got to write a better address on that this won't get delivered the way you've written this address is not going to get delivered and and so you you bounce back some questions and say maybe the better question to ask is blank for example like you know instead of how could we succeed which is like a million paths all unknown it's what would make this certainly a failure that's much more knowable and we can we can establish a few ground rules from that question and get some momentum towards this and uh you could see this with your brain just like if you ask ch you know they call it prompt engineering when it comes for AI right being able to ask the AI in a certain way that's going to get you a better result absolutely the same thing is true for yourself and for people around you to ask better questions right um I do I I I ask annoyingly stupid questions to my team all the time like it'll be um one question I love to ask is what are we stupid for not doing right now and it's just that question comes loaded with a presumption that there's something stupid we're of course there is we're always doing stupid things and specifically what are we stupid for not doing right now meaning what is an obvious loow hanging fruit that's in our face and we're out here searching for the complex when the simple stupidly obvious thing is is here and you know I I would say more than 50% of the time there's a useful answer to that question but if you didn't ask that question it would just go unspoken in your company right so like how many are those another one that I learned from Amazon is Amazon asked this thing in the if you're like if you're an exec that leads the team you have to like write this document at the end of the year called the op1 I think it's the operating plan one and you you do two a year right the operating plan one and then you have the operating plan two halfway through the year was that effective yeah it's great uh I'm I'm a fan of the Amazon writing culture it's easy to make fun of also and easy to do wrong but when done right super effective so one of the things that they one of the like common questions that they ask in that is what are the dogs not barking and it's back to that Sherlock Holmes story where he solves the case because he's like and they're like how did you know Sherlock and he's like cuz there's like a house break in they're trying to figure out who did it and he's like well it was the dog of course they go but the dog the dog didn't do anything he goes exactly the dog didn't bark which means he must have recognized the person that broke in which means it must have been you know the housekeeper or whatever right and so in your business there's what are the dogs not barking is a good way of asking what are the things that there's really like I I interpret in two ways one is what are the things we should be hearing that were not so for example one week I didn't send out my Friday email and I just sat there and I was like emails being like Hey where's the Friday thing man I love that I didn't get that okay dog not barking right and then I had changed how I did the Friday emails because of that it's like well why' you make that pivot It's like because I I did Jenga dude I took a block out and the tower was fine nothing nothing fell down I'm trying to only have like I'm trying to be an email in your inbox that if I remove that email your life got worse you know and you you want you want to speak to the manager where's my goddamn email right like if door Dash doesn't deliver your food you're you're knocking on a door I want to be at least more powerful than the door Dash delivery right like that's that's what I'm striving for and so that's one way of interpreting it the other way is um what are the problems that you don't hear about yet but are certainly there um that's another way to think about the dogs not barking is like you know anticipate a problem around the corner because we know it's going to be there um um but we just haven't heard it yet but you know we we can anticipate it and maybe get ahead of it dude I'm telling you there's going to be a world probably in 3 years where you're going to like so the issue that a lot of smart people like you and me and people listening is like you're like well I'm really smart and I feel like I'm wise and I feel like I know what to do but like it's a lot of work and then like literally the the idea guys are going to thrive in 5 years or the wise people because there's going to be AI agents doing all of this for you you know what I mean like you're not going to have to actually do that work you're just your your opinions or your D right cuz then who's why can't the AI do the idea part too right who's that's happen too that's it's not you're not I don't think you are so so then what right and and then that's when the brain breaks and you're like I guess it's over then and uh I'm not sure wait so are you actually afraid yeah kind of like I I don't want to say afraid because I'm not like you know quivering in my boots about it but I guess like I don't have a satisfying answer and for most things in my life I got a pretty satisfying answer sometimes the answer is just I'll deal with it when it happens right I'll just adjust right and I could feel safe I could feel comfortable with that uh that's usually my fail safe with this one it's kind of like so when the AI can do everything right which is like it seems like it's a matter of when not if at this point um okay and it's like seems like it's in my lifetime probably in the next 10 years um it could do the work but it can also figure out what the work to be done is all right well I guess like I'm less afraid of the like uh oh and then it's going to crush human humans and try to you know it'll go Rogue and it'll it'll attack us like I'm not as afraid of that as I am just like that what's the point of all this what's the point of doing any of this stuff if that's going to be true and that's kind of just like a a weird place to land um so you want there what the [ __ ] right podcasts are all that safe dude no they're not no they're not perplexity has a daily podcast that's really good they just take the news that as great and then they have or no it's not perplexity it's a what's the thing 11 Labs 11 Labs has they use like a Steven fry voice and they read the news I listen to it it's awesome it's not safe we're not safe no one's safe maybe like a plumber a plumber safe well I actually think our strategy is pretty genius because we are getting stupider uh right just like we dumb ourselves down and AI is trying to get smarter and so there's actually a white space in the market for some just imperfect knowledge some uh some half-baked ideas and some uh some some incorrectness I think we've really I think we've stumbled on to something I think we might be the last one standing in this whole podcast game it's us and Theo Von it's just like the dumbest conversations on Earth are going to be all that's left because the AI is going to do all the Smart Ones maybe may I mean yeah I don't know Mark Andre should be scared right now not us dude yeah the smart guys are [ __ ] like the Smart Guys built the smart guys are digging their own Graves they're like their shovels are clanking together on accident as they're like digging the same grave they're like oh sorry my bad it's like they don't realize that you guys are going into this grave in about a year is that my name on the tombstone that's weird it must be a problem is there another Mark here two Mark Andre like they think that they're like they're like we're put the blue collar guy in this grave and we're gonna outso this [ __ ] job they're like huh I've never Mr ADR said are you here like you know what I mean dude I found my my new sick burn in the uh Tik Tok comments you know there's all these Tik Tok clips of podcasts like we should probably be doing this but we don't really do it very much but like people just clip you know podcast s uh Snippets and that's like a lot of Tik toks um and the more viral the more basically the more outrageous the comment in the in the podcast the more viral the Tik toac clip because you're going get a bunch of comments being like this is that no that's wrong that's stupid that's whatever and um I saw the best one it was just the top top- liked comment on a podcast clip which just it just said podcasting equipment is way too readily available it's like damn anybody could just get a microphone now uh that's how I feel when I see a lot of these clips I'm like wow this [ __ ] is these microphones are way too easy to access have you heard that song another white boy with a podcast no song yes there a song called another white boy with a podcast God damn how did I not think of that it's sort of like that uh like Finance 64 blue eyes uh it just says like Joe Rogan like it just says like a bunch of like random phrases but it's called another play that song on the way out of this that'll be our outro all right cue the music another white boy with a podcast Krypto gim BR Bill Prep sports so smart and funny we should make a party we buy mics we get chairs we sit down with blank stairs we're going to be billionaires just don't forget to like and share oo another white boy with a podcast

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
ladies and gentlemen here we are four years in a row the end of year Millie Awards where we get together and we recap the year we make up a bunch of categories we make up a bunch of answers and we reflect on how the year is gone with uh with our awards ceremony so Sam are you ready I'm [Music] ready I like jacket are you going to start wearing this stuff more often it feels like a little suit of armor yeah I already got a compliment this morning inside the house so I think maybe I should start uh dressing well maybe that's going to be my change of the year we'll see it's uh December 26 you got a compliment this year probably the only compliment you got all year yeah the only looks compliment for sure men don't get compliments so you should wear jackets more um all right where do we want to start all right we're going to start category we have 11 11 Awards to give out we're going to start with number one best investment of the year and these are person by the way these are our personal best investments worst Investments that sort of thing so Sam what was your best investment of the Year dud what do you think I'm going to say the S&P 500 the S&P 500 up 28% but that one's boring I don't want to just say that the best investment I we had this year I do you remember Jason Cohen uh we had on the Pod Jason Cohen started what's it called WP WP love that guy no I just can't remember the the company uh anyway he made a comment I think after the Pod where he talked about tipping and I was like I like to tip you know I was like I I just hand out fives and he goes FES you should be handing out 20s like he goes I tip like crazy and I started doing that after the Pod and so I carry around about $1,000 of 20s at any given point and I am just dishing that [ __ ] out like crazy and you want to know something it's made me so happy and so that's been a great investment my but and I wanted to bring that up cuz my investment strategies are pretty boring but man I'll tell you what I'll go to a restaurant and it'll be like $60 cuz we don't drink and like it's like a cheap we're cheap dates I'll I'll easily leave 100 and then you stick around to wait for the uh the reaction too you're like did you did you see that just want to make sure you get that it's right under there listen I thought it was tacky to do that but I say screw them I'm doing something nice I want to I want like a compliment like it makes me feel good too I'm doing this for selfish reasons it makes me feel good so I don't mind it as long as I'm not filming it it's okay that's what I think do you guys share these or is that all yours right there no dude but seriously tipping has made me happier but investment but it's it's hard for me to say best investment because I am so boring although I do have one Angel investment and figure that's going to pay a lot of money so far on paper Okay so Sam's favorite ice cream is vanilla all right here we go what do you want me to say am I supposed to make something up all right I will make up for your boring answer with I have two answers I'll give you the first one okay so Sam best investment when I think of the perfect investment right what's my type my type would be you know some people like blond some people like brunettes here's my type my type is a passive investment that is tax advantaged that beats market returns that is uncorrelated to my the rest of my portfolio Tech crypto has low downside and I'm betting on a beast of an operator who has an unfair Advantage it sounds like you're trying to sell me a time share close it's real estate you got it and so I for the first time made some serious investment invested a few million dollars into real estate this year and it was great I for a long time I had thought I should probably be doing real estate I should probably take this magic internet money put it in real estate um so that I have kind of both I have real world tangible assets that pay cash flow and then I have this like kind of crazy upside Tech stuff and I never could figure out the way to do it I was like do I buy my own and manage it that seems like a pain do I use one of these kind of like funds or whatever but they're all just fee monsters and uh the answer was sitting in my in my own wheelhouse my brother-in-law is an amazing real estate operator the GU built like a billion dollar real estate portfolio for himself and so I just started giving him money and um it's been amazing I don't lift a finger and I'm getting like you know 30 40% returns uh with all the tax advantages so that was my best investment and I'll be doubling down there but I have a bonus answer for you the bonus answer is I made a couple of stock trades I know you don't approve not supposed to buy individual stocks but I did but I did it in a very specific way that I think you might dig which was I just have been trading against the all-in podcast for like two years now are you kidding me and it has been phenomenal give me an example and also like is this like casino gambling money or is this like like in my opinion anything above $100,000 is like leg okay real bets then uh okay so you're doing real these are Big bets but I just viewed them as as safe like they're not like they're not like obscure Penny Stu like Amazon or something so what will happen is all in podcast uh love listening to it very entertaining guys very smart guys I just don't think they're right a lot and they're not wri in one specific they have one specific leak which is that they have like an agenda which is often you know either talking their own their own book or it's anti-woke anti- anti big big Tech they like to making money part no and getting good gains so like you know Jason K canis goes out and he says the most likely case is Bitcoin zero and he tweets this out and then on the all-in podcast they're talking about crypto and all the problems with it well guess what I decided to buy Bitcoin that day and then the and then Google releases its new AI model and it has this problem where you say show me a picture of George Washington and it shows you a black guy yeah and they're like Google's so woke it's going down the drain well your your year to date on Google is 41% uh yeah exactly so easiest tra easiest money to make was just to trade against the all podcast so uh here's an example chamath tweets out the growing short case against Facebook and he says regulation is a problem taxes is a problem antitrust is a problem all this stuff I bet on Facebook I'm up 5x so I made 500% on that trade and so basically they went anti- Bitcoin for a period of time and then they they swung back they went anti- meta and they made this case why Zuck was being an idiot he was investing way too much capex into AR and VR more money than had ever been invested in the development of the iPhone it all sounds very very smart but my little simpleton brain went back to like N I think I think zuck's the man I I know I spend a [ __ ] like I have an e-commerce business every dollar I can spend on the Facebook ad engine I spend yeah you're like they him to take more money yeah oh iOS 14 is was a problem no no I I still spend more than I spent before that uh and there's no better place to spend a dollar in advertising than on Facebook the close second was Google right so when they went anti-google for being woke I bought Google when they went anti Facebook I went I bought Facebook anti Bitcoin I bought Bitcoin and it's just been very very profitable for me to do this that's amazing that's really funny I think it's sort of like the inverse Kramer or inverse Galloway uh indexes where they just they just literally whatever this popular popular Figure Head says they they just bet the opposite I've basically been doing that for about 2 and a half years against the all-in podcast and only now was I willing to say it dude by the way I uh you we had this guy on the Pod who become a great friend of mine named Val him and I he was the main guy I was a very small investor we bought a building in Brooklyn I killed it on that I think I had a 28% annual like return not including the tax stuff but my worst investment this year do you remember how I said I was remember how I bought a ranch right I sold it this year so so stupid maybe I lo I lost money because I could have used that money to invest in something that made a lot more but I basically uh like kind of broke even so it wasn't that huge of a loss but it was so stressful and my learning is that I had this issue where I sold a company I made money and I thought I was on top of the world and I thought I could buy I so I I fully bought three different pieces of real estate intending to like turn into projects not one of them was great uh two were bad one was break even and I that's been my biggest failure is like thinking like huis and thinking that I'm amazing and and also full buying real estate that you have to operate it's just like starting a small business that you have to work 10 hours a week on it sucks it's hard my rule is if it's active it has to generate more than 50% the bar is way different if it's passive it could be 7% it's fine but um if it's active it's got to be more than 50% if it's active investment and so that's why I gave you the traits I said passive tax advantage beats the market right like I had this list if I could ever find an investment that does that and finally found one I thought it would be cool to like you know that's like every you know like that's like one of the five things that men love is like they all say they want to own a lot of land and I did it and I hated it like dude listen to this like I would drive up to I I had a Tesla at the time I would beat in the country and I would have these like workers come to like decide uh to put in a bid to pave the driveway I would get a $70,000 quote and a $3,000 quote like that's that was the Delta and it was all because of the way I looked they're like this guy doesn't know [ __ ] you know like it was crazy I got taken advantage so many times it sucked so I I I don't think I'll be doing that anytime soon and for that reason I'm out all right what about worst investment that was my worst investment was was any fully owned real estate any real estate that I was a investor in I loved it anything that I fully owned and wanted to like make it my thing because of Pride I I failed miserably hey let's take a quick break to talk about our sponsor today HubSpot has put together a list of 200 AI business ideas these are

brought to you by HubSpot you can get it for free in the link below all right my worst investment um this was a little bit hard I did well this year but I would say if I I had to stretch back a couple of years and say what was the first worst over the last couple of years and I would say I made a general rookie mistake which was I would buy on the upswing and I would sell during the Panic times meaning I would I would try to hedge bets and try to time markets so when covid happened I thought oh my God the whole economy is going to shut down and I was right for a month and then right after that stocks exploded and I was sitting on the sidelines where the stocks that I already owned started soaring and I had to buy back in at higher prices crypto crashed with FTX and other things and when morale was at its lowest my conviction was at its lowest I I behaved I behaved like a pleb I'm not I'm not I'm not proud to say it I'm ashamed to say it I behave like a pleb when when things were bad my conviction went low when things were good my conviction went high this is the opposite way to make money I kind of knew this but in the moment it was a lot harder than I expected to actually Master my own psychology as an investor what is the word pleb are you thinking that means ple I say pleb you say really which one of us is wrong I don't know which one though I don't have enough conviction but you might have taken another L there exactly such a ple I don't even know how to say it yeah it's it sucks to be doing things that you know you would advise people not to do in the moment in the Moment by the way this is why information is not power knowledge is not power so when Co happened uh I think it was February in San Francisco and you know we were all in our Apartments thinking the world was literally going to end and I remember I it's the only time I've ever done this the market dropped I think 30% literally the day it was its lowest I sold 100% of everything I owned yeah exactly I thought bodies are going to pile up in New York I thought the world's ending and I had friends who did the opposite of me and are returns were drastically different and that was the lesson that like that moment had to teach me do not do this you know when Warren Buffett he says all these smart phrases and they sound cool and you're like yeah I'm in I'm in When the tide goes low I can see everyone swimming naked I'm in that's all you got to do I'll be a billionaire but then when it actually happens it's hard it's scary it's emotional and I fell victim to that and it sounds like you did too uh at least once 100% also during that time I was picking I remember between two stocks I was like okay I think the future is some version of AI but but also potentially VR and AR and I plowed a bunch of money into Unity instead of Nvidia I was looking at the two and I was like is it Unity or Nvidia I should have just bet on both but instead I picked unity and unity has has done nothing and Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world so you know sometimes you do that too that's also a way to lose what did what did Unity become I've lost like 60% of my investment on Unity unity's gone nowhere is there like a threshold of like for your what's your lowest trade dollar amount is it like $1,000 or always above of 100,000 more like 100,000 got it so I don't have like an actual minimum but I wouldn't I Bean go and put in $1,000 dollar is it's not really like that exciting or it's kind of a waste of time right it depends how you look at it like for example I think stock picking is stupid but I think that you're like well I spend like um five grand uh over the couple months just going to the casino like this could be an exciting thing like I remember for the when the AMC [ __ ] was going crazy I thought it'd be fun if I was like I was like all right I'll do the thing and I'll put like only a grand in just as like just to play the game and then maybe I'll talk about it on here and it it was dumb it was stupid it wasn't I've done that with like Dogecoin and stuff like that but but yeah that that's that's the true gambling budget all right let's do the next one biggest L you took personally this year dude so my daughter was born uh 15 months ago and I gave myself 4 months to like just be kind of lazy and not be on top of like my time management and that like you know like on Thanksgiving you're like yes the night before like the cookies are being made I could just it's kind of the same day as Thanksgiving it's okay if I splurge but then like Friday happens and you're like well they're leftovers I got to eat them and then by Sunday you're still kind of piging out a little bit I basically did that for like 6 months where I was like pretty horrible with my time and I wasted so much time this year um and it really bothered me and so this year I've made some changes that I I'll talk about when we get to that category of like changes we're making next year but I wasted so much time on my daughter was born and it wasn't and this isn't like people listening being like well you should have downtime to hang out with her it's like yeah I I did that I was totally present but 6 months I'm Aline when she's at there Nanny and I'm still kind of like moving slow and like you know what I mean it was kind of so what what do you mean by wasting time what are we talking about here I'll give you an example so I would shift my schedule like my workout schedule so I could be with her in the morning but and and that actually meant that she actually wouldn't get out of bed until 700 The Nanny would come at 9:00 and so between 700 and 9:00 I would hang out at home and then work out from you know 9: to 10:30 which is like a pretty lazy morning for me versus working out what used to do at 7:30 and so the nanny now comes at 8 and I like dude I should have just switched to like I can now start my day a little bit earlier but I didn't so I was still going to the gym later and just lounging around the house for hours things like that but like there was five things where it's like accumulated was like dude four hours 5 hours a day was just wasted it sounds like you're been hard on yourself but okay I I'll I'll accept your L each man's L is his own to to carry it's it's a burden he carries you didn't have that where you wasted time when you had your kid like it's okay I think to like be lazy for a while described as your unproductive day was sort of my productive day so I don't know I don't know what you're talking about I'm like oh wait so you you took care of your kid and worked out in the morning that sounds great sounds like a great morning I don't know what you're talking about it was just like I just I I didn't get after it at all and I found myself to be like you and also when you have a kid and I experienced this where I'm like oh nothing else matters but you should still kind of pretend it does so you could like kind of be productive and I kind of like acted like nothing else mattered all right I um the biggest L I took there were so many to choose from to be honest from uh forgetting our anniversary and then uh trying to recover and guessing the date wrong that was not great um and by the way she didn't even care which was like oh damn I've Lowered Expectations to that to that level okay gotcha so that was a quick L I took um the whole I don't know if you guys wait can you solve can you solve this for me for or should anniversaries be the first time you dated or when you got married and once you get married it switches to the marriage anniversary is my official stance I have been trying to say that it should be dating the whole time because you know what I mean like sometimes you'll date for 5 years you could do nothing for the marriage [ __ ] that it should be when you start when you it should be your first date that's what an anniversary should be in my opinion the first time we kissed with tongue that's it all right so um so then another L I took was a I was a I was collateral damaged to this whole I don't know if you know about the elf in the Shelf [ __ ] insanity like I lost my wife this month and you know I went to like a widow thing and they were like what and I was like no no I just lost her to Elf on the Shelf like this has been crazy she's up every night for 4 hours preparing this elaborate you know elf um you know setup and then she sleep she has to sleep during the day and I don't know what's happening I don't know what Who tricked women in America into doing this but it is um it's like doing 75 hard except for you wake up at 2: in the morning to do it and you do it for 30 days instead what is it so it's like a doll that stares on the shelves and like is omnipresent and watches your children so you could scare them into not doing bad stuff so okay so I think there original theory was like you get a elf comes to your house and it sits on a shelf and in the morning it moves and you're like oh my God it moved how what's up with that but women on the internet have taken this to a whole new level it doesn't just move it creates schemes and plots and Tricks and Treats like uh you know my kids wake up they come downstairs the entire living room has been turned into the floor is lava there's fire on the ground everywhere the tree is covered it looks like a volcano now the elves are hanging from the chandelier doing crazy stuff or they take all of the underwear that was in all of the drawers of all of the house and they put it all over the roof of the house and you got to go outside and be like oh my God what did they do so every night they create a whole we had to get our toilet replaced cuz they turned our toilet into a cereal bowl and then somebody flushed and now we just fro Loops just clogged the toilet we toilet you just break your [ __ ] yeah you just do crazy stuff every every night you come up with like a giant episode of punked by Ashton Kutcher a huge prank occurs and that you have to come up with every night and you buy thousands of dollars of materials cuz the elves have their own sized stuff that you like somebody had a knowing rodent in their home causing Havoc they wouldn't put it on the shelf and say hi to it they would kill it what exactly and so if you don't know about this you're just like what what are you talking about this is weird strange Behavior but if you're in it there's guys out there right now that are sort of like PTSD shakes are coming over their body because they've also been experiencing this um and I don't know if I'm in the minority I don't know if in I'm in the the slight minority or the majority I don't know who I don't know how many people do this I just know that my wife and her friends they do this and she's in these Facebook groups with hundreds of thousands of women and every morning they post the elaborate things that they set up and then that Spurs all of them to go even crazier with it so I'm going to say that Elf on the Shelf was mon of mne uh do to your coolest moment all all right uh you give me yours uh so uh this year I had to go to La for a Hampton thing where I had to interview Rob deerdick in front of a a bunch of people very randomly someone was like hey uh I'm going to back home to La I'm in Austin right now I'm going tonight someone mentioned that in the morning you're going to La I'm with my wealthy famous friend who I'm not going to say uh they actually have a jet and they're going to LA tonight and I got this text and I had committed to uh putting my baby to sleep this was like in the first handful of months and I was like I'm going to be here every night and I was like dude I don't want to sound like a douche and I want you know that was this is I'm so grateful you offered me but I can't go because you want to leave at 600 and I said I'm going to be here till 8:30 and he was like oh we'll go at 8:30 and I was like awesome and I was like [ __ ] again I don't want to be a dick but my friend Neville is coming with me uh tomorrow morning which he was and I was like I could never bail on him and he was like great we have room for him and and and they totally accommodated me and so my best friend Neville and flew to LA on this very wealthy famous person's private jet and I got to spend like 3 hours like learning from this guy it was so fun and so awesome and that was like one of my not just because we are flying private it was just awesome that like I got to do this adventure with my friend that was that was the best moment I had all year but if you flew Southwest would it have been the coolest moment of the year on the way back I because we had to change our flights we flew Southwest next to the toilet it was a very ying and yang situation and it was still fantastic okay that one didn't win the award though that one didn't win the award but it was fun it's like you know you know uh you know that Meme where there's like a guy in the hoodie says like uh nobody here knows but I invested in Bitcoin in 2012 that's like how I felt like in line in Southwest like you know like they should ask me on the way here how'd you get here hey you want to know how I got here on the way here that's how it felt I was like somebody asked me oh this is so different for me all right love that one um okay I'll do a quick one I I kind of struggled with this one I guess I'll give you a quick one so for Thanksgiving this year we were going to host it I decided to um do a a full family vacation so kind of like you know how do I okay if we've done well we've had some success how do I make sure that that like you know makes everybody have a great time and and that that I care about in my little economy me and so I rented out this um this really cool house in Tahoe I brought my whole family up to Tahoe hired a personal chef who would cook us the Thanksgiving meal live and I just remember there was one morning where I woke up and it was just the best morning like I took my dog out in the snow my dog was like mind blown at what snow is so I took my dog for a walk early in the morning it was crisp I didn't have my phone I didn't even know where my phone was came inside my kids were all playing with their cousins and that was so cool to see um somebody was you know making breakfast in the other room room and I could smell it me and my brother-in-law we were playing uh we played a game of like horse on the little Nerf hoop that was in the house and I just had the best morning and I just remember being like this this was Bliss um like if I could CCH it yeah it ticked all my boxes right like whole family living Under One Roof kids are having a blast I'm playing a silly game on a Nerf hoop there's not a worry in the world we don't you know we're not busy we're not rushing it was just a wonderful feeling so I'm going to give my my Tahoe warning my coolest moment of the year the takeaway by the way should I've done that for two years now I I did the first time I think last year it I when I was doing best moments I was like it was either what I just said or this thing taking family and just paying for it and it sounds like a ridiculous and it's very expensive and it's very challenging for a lot of people but if you can pull it off it is almost always one of the best moments it feels if and the second takeaway is the coolest moments that I think we've had for a lot of these things it's always doing things that benefit other people somehow do you know what I mean like accommodating other people into our lives is the it's the best feeling it's usually not like some huge like traditional career accomplishment it's always like it's always doing something cool for other people so I agree that's a good one that you have although yours was somebody flying you private but the best I if no the best part was uh doing it with my friend uh the fact that we got that we had this like shared experience together that was that was great uh all right I've got a quick one for life hack do you want to know my you want to know my my biggest life like life hack uh that I started doing and this is so big basic to people but on Thursday I do this on Thursday not on Friday I print out I'll show I print out everything that I have to do for the next week and up top is my q1 focus and goals and that's like you know tell my wife how much I appreciate her every day but also like traditional business goals and also fitness goals and then I have what I did last week and any Reflections on it and then I have a category that says how my assistant can help me and my assistant every morning prints us off at my house and so so it's ready for me a Monday morning and I carry this piece of paper with me around everywhere like during the workday and that's what I use to make sure I'm getting [ __ ] done I don't use notion I don't use a I don't use any of that crap and just having this printed out has been so much more helpful for me than any type of digital complicated [ __ ] totally I have one over here on the ground it's like I bought these if you go buy like sketch pads like you know uh artists or Architects have it's really high quality paper large pads with nice pens um such a easy win to go to go analog instead of digital with that stuff by the way I think you should level it up and you need like a seal of s some sort of coat of arms for your family I feel like you would like that and like either stamp Wax Seal I feel like if you just made it more prestigious honestly it would be kind of amusing and it would be fun and I a presidential briefing I completely age exactly like just give it a little stamp and be like hell yeah that's me that's how I roll and Like This Is Us official so I I want you to do that that's a great idea actually completely agree what's yours okay life hack for me um the highs and lows Channel have I told you about this my highs and lows channel is that for work yeah kind of I mean it's was for everything but I have a slack channel for every company I have a slack Channel called highs and lows and in it anytime there's a high high in the moment of that business or a low low so you know for example on Christmas Eve The Mexican government decided to ban all Imports into Mexico of textiles which effectively shut down my entire Warehouse on Christmas Eve and we can no longer like operate because our warehous in Mexico yeah like two days ago and so you're like ah here we are business can now not our Ecom business has no inventory for the foreseeable future and I've got millions of dollars of inventory sitting in a warehouse there that now is you know uh blockaded thank you Mexican government Thank you new president of Mexico for this Christmas present and so in the moment where I'm feeling a low something bad happened a lawsuit or a big client gets lost or someone key quits or whatever it is right I go into that channel and I just type what happened but the beautiful thing is instead of addressing the current problem or basking in the glory of the current High what when I go to the channel I just see the last one that I had because it's right there scrolled up and I just see oh man I had a huge low then that feels like nothing now right or I had a huge high before that also feels like nothing now and it is this stoic trick of the brain to basically just write down I'm having a high or I'm having a low right now but in the place where I'm writing it I see my last higher low and the one before that and the one before that and it just like Thermo regulates my brain my brain says oh okay it's not as bad as it seems nor as as good as it seem it humbles me or it keeps my morale High whatever I need in that moment and um it's so effective just to have this little simple Channel have you ever heard of negative visualization yeah like sort of imagining what the worst that could happen is scenarios it's a a tool that I I think it was popularized by the sto the famous stoics but basically you sit down for about 5 minutes and you instead of meditating you just imagine the worst things on Earth are true your kid is dying of cancer your wife has already died you're broke like you're you know her whatever and then if you actually visualize that for like five or you know so minutes it kind of almost feels weird it's really strange and then you wake up and you open your eyes you go oh sick none of that's true how grateful I feel right now and it's like a pretty useful tool U and what you're describing is very similar to that yeah except for this is these are real moments that I remember and like I have evidence of versus trying to do this ex I mean this is I'm saving people thousands of dollars in therapy if you just create a little highs and lows Channel you'll therapy yourself because you'll go in and it'll you'll remember I've been high before I've been low before and either way I walk out I it's it's that that Richard Kipling poem I treat Triumph and disaster I treat those two imposters the same and uh this is the fastest most effective way to do it dude that reminds you know one of my I think Conor McGregor has taken a fall from grace I really don't like him anymore but he has a lot of like amazing things that he says that I buy into and he's got this one thing do you remember have you ever seen what he says uh about having the same ad attitude in Victory or defeat yeah yeah exactly what is what does he say would you know the exact line um he he basically says um I forgot what it was it was like you know humble in Victory and something you know something in defeat which is by the way not what he does at all anymore but yeah yeah that was his original original thesis look it up uh yeah like I think last time he lost he in the Octagon he was telling the opponent humble in Victory humble in defeat and and actually last time he lost he was telling the man's wife that he like you know she was cheating on him your wife is in my DMs your wife is in my DMs so he says quot though he should learn from some Conor mcgreer quotes I really want to create a compilation and just show it to him and be like dude you'll you'll love this guy and just see if see if it so this is McGregor back when we both loved him I am cocky in prediction I'm confident in preparation but I am always humble in Victory or defeat it's the best right there you go right so we did life act let's do now number eight only four left number eight Billy of the year who is our Billy of the year we do this segment called Billy of the week where we profile just a big baller shot Coller somebody who is either a billionaire or just making big moves who do you think was making the biggest of the big moves this year so My pick this is not going to sound sexy but I'll make a case um do you know I don't know if this ever happened to you but in high school sophomore year and everybody has their place in the social hierarchy you know who the Nerds are you know who the the jocks are you know who the theater kids are you know who's the glue guys that can fit in with everybody and then you all leave for the summer but then there's always that one kid who leaves for the summer and they get that little second puberty bump they get that extra you know 4 inches of height they start growing a little facial hair they they start working out all summer cuz their cousin came into town and taught them how to work out you know they picked up a hobby they learned a guitar or they start you know doing MMA or something like that and then and they start dressing differently and you hear rumor that they hooked up with like a college girl during the summer and they had like a fling and then they come back and they're just a whole new guy and there's like a conversation like is is great cool now yeah and undeniably Greg is cool Mark Zuckerberg pulled a Greg this year so here's the case for Zuck his stock is up five 500% in the last 24 months he's gained hundred billion doll of net worth he is now the third richest man in the world but more than that he's not just one of the rich guys right cuz that that criteria would apply to Elon it apply to Jeff B Bill Gates there's other guys who are super rich he found a hobby that he loves and it got him into tremendous shape Zak started doing MMA Jiu-Jitsu uh striking and now Zak is fit he's ripped he's got a hobby that he loves that takes his mind off of work he is playing the world's most competitive game which is the AI game and I don't know how much you followed this but Zuck had a a a a judo flip basically he had a differentiated way to win uh you know open AI was in front and Google had Deep Mind and Zuck came out and open sourc to all of their their models and created an open source competitor to basically compete in this market and he's doing extremely well there he went from a robot to a cool guy he like dresses like a cool guy now and has like a cool guy haircut so he he did like a personal style upgrade he you know he's not like you know elon's on his you know third or fourth failed marriage you know 11 kids from three different women same woman since College zuck's got his college sweetheart got his daughters app you know appears to be a really great dad by all accounts and I just respect that I just respect that he's had this allaround game aged right he's just had this really strong floor game where he's just covered all the bases of what I consider to be a really good life he's doing what he loves on and off the court and um you know is this lame to say Mark Zuckerberg but I got to say Mark Zuckerberg he uh have you like you you don't know about running but he ran a 5K time uh he ran a 5k recently and he ran it in 19 minutes that's really fit he's like real fit did you see that post where he talked about his murf his murf time yeah the murf he did an insane murf seem like he's he's he's not like one of these like you know like Vince mmah is like 80 years old like weirdly like old jacked or like you know Joe Rogan has this too where they have this like really weird body cuz they're taking like trt like crazy it's like oh these people have these weird OIC bodies or trt bodies no he's he just like worked out a lot and ate good yeah he like eats an apple and chicken like he he looks great you know what I mean he looks great yeah that's a great one and he's um I really like his wife she's turned into like this kind of uh I don't know like thought leader Michelle Obama e like you know like she's kind of hip and cool and I care about her opinion a lot like she's kind of like a a little bit of a tast how do you even know this because I what I love about her is that she's not out there trying to get Limelight she's not doing anything that's public right she does a lot of stuff private with their Foundation but I've seen her talk at at at uh uh conferences and then I also Duck's been going to UFC and they'll show her in the background uh at and then one of the fighters is like she or she'll be like hey that choke was cool and he'll be like do you want to learn it and she'll be like yeah and so she like comes like puts the guy in a choke like she's just kind of like in it and she just doesn't seem you know how like people loved Princess D cuz she was like you know woman of the people it's she kind of has that Vibe a little bit and I I I appreciate that I have not seen that uh but I have seen like they there was like an interview recently where somebody was like following him around for the day and she was there and she was just so down to earth and cool and was like making fun of him but in like you know like you know when couples are together and it's like you could tell that they have fun together but you can also tell they they don't hate each other it's like you can make fun of somebody without being like really bitter on the inside I just thought like the vibe I got know was just a little clip but the vibe I got was uh was great um so mine was uh do you remember meetup.com founder Scott is it hyperman the heer heer let's call him the heer big so the the short of it is the story is basically this guy named Scott he started um a digital ad company that he sold for like $15 million enough to get like very wealthy as a 28-year-old he leaves Tech and he goes and he joins McDonald's and he works at McDonald as a you know a cashier or something like that and people like actually noticed him and someone wrote I think Fast Company wrote an article and they're like what the hell are you doing he's like dude I've been around ad Executives for the last 10 years or or you know 5 years I've been around tech people I needed to get out of my bubble and so I just went and worked at McDonald's and I learned it's really hard work and I'm so thankful that I am where I am and I'm going to go back to by way he didn't just do it for like a day this wasn't like a field trip like he he actually worked there for like months and months yeah and he worked there and then he left and he started meetup.com which I think eventually was worth hundreds of millions of dollars sold it and as of late if you go to his LinkedIn he has not made an ordeal out of this this is all other people like us talking about it and making an ordeal out of it but now he is an Amazon warehouse worker and he's working in the Amazon warehouse and he kind of is doing the exact same thing and I think that's so baller that he's doing that and so baller that he is not doing it for PR it's like some soul searching thing and I think it's fantastic I think it's pretty badass so he was kind I don't he's not actually a billionaire but he's quite wealthy I would imagine it's that Billy it's that Billy mindset it's that bill he's got that he's got B Energy living life on your own terms he he is doing that um love it okay that's a good one that's a good pull all right uh what's next now this one this one is frame breaking person so we should explain this one so both you and I love one specific thing that I don't even think other people have a word for we call it frame breing somebody who breaks your frame Scott is a great example of this it's somebody who lives their life or acts in a way that sort of defies your expectation breaks your frame on what's either normal what's acceptable what's possible what's cool it's somebody who just lives differently in a way that just sh shatters your your your Norm your worldview norm and I I wanted to make a category for this because this is one of my favorite things when I meet somebody who's like this so frame breing person who did you have this year I'll uh I'll say frame breing is this guy Brian Johnson so Brian Johnson is the guy who wants to live forever guy and he's frame breaking not because the he wants to live forever uh [ __ ] which is definitely cool but I hung out with him and so for those who don't know Brian Johnson is a guy who started a company uh that kind of turned into vend and a bunch of other things he sold it for $500 million and now he's spending a lot of money to try to live forever and you see him on Instagram all the time he said something to me I was like why are you doing this um you know and we were just talking about stuff and he goes you know I read this book on mellin and mellan was a a sailor in the Explorer in the 1500s or 1400s and he basically sailed around the globe and he proved all this amazing stuff and I just thought it was so amazing and I was starting to and I made a list of like the top 10 top 15 people to ever live and what their contributions were you know uh the W Brothers with flight the person who invented electricity or discovered electricity like people like that and he's like none of them were like rich like it like money didn't impact people uh it didn't impact the world as much and I just thought that if I could solve like a really hard problem and contribute to the world I thought that that would be a life worth living and I just decided that I'm going to try and do everything in my day to be renowned in the year 2500 he's like in 2005 I hope to create like and contribute to the to society in such a way that in 2500 they talk about me and I thought that was absolutely bananas I don't know if I want to do that but I thought it was so cool that he was like I don't care about money cuz money and I was like he's like that he's like who was the richest person 500 years ago I was like I don't I I don't know he's like yeah that's my point but you've heard him mellin uh and so I thought it was such a frame-breaking moment um for me to to like hear his reasoning as to why he's trying to do what he's do which is prolong death or solve for death he's like if I solve that would you say that will I'll be remembered I like yeah yeah you will and he's like that's how I want to spend my day that's an amazing answer um I love that he did that just all the things you just said making a list of the 15 most influ most impactful or influential people ever what a what a list I think I want to go do that just to even see what that list he should it was like um it was like Orville it was the R Brothers it was the the Gutenberg Press it was mellin like there was like like 10 of them he was like these changed the world forever and he's like do you know how many of them are like rich people none uh they're just like inventors or something like that I thought you were G to say oral Redenbacher and I was like I'm not gonna I'm not going to complain if that's the if if he's on the list okay so my answer for frame breaking person is Nick Gray and I could see that this is going to be an answer but it's my true answer this is my truth and I'm going to speak by Truth uh is it not it's not Elon Musk somebody I met and hung out with I had a uh a flight so I went and spoke at this event and they they were like hey we'll fly you private and I was like okay cool and Nick was going to the same place as I was he's like hey can I come with you and I was like yeah no problem that'd be great so I Nick was Nick was the same in that situation yeah exactly so I was like one-on-one with him for like five hours or something on a you know which is that's a long time that's a long conversation that's like more time than I spend talking to most people right and I walked away and I'll just going read you my um text to my sister after I hung out with Nick so I hung out with Nick I try to play cool and afterwards I get off the plane I go I just hang out with a guy who has has such a zest for life I go I've hung out with a lot of rich people but this guy's rich in a different way he is rich in Social wealth he's got tons of friends he is rich in Amusement I feel like everything he does in a way everything he does in a day amuses him and he's doing it on his terms I go he is corny and totally himself in the best way possible and I I just want to tell you a couple of the things that just stood out to me like prolific things this guy did this year so we've talked about the Tokyo blind date where he says I want to go to Tokyo but I don't want to go alone fill out this Google form and I want to take one person on a blind date with me to Tokyo and he gets thousands of responses he picks a girl he almost Falls in Love on this day he does the whole thing publicly and it goes viral this guy's having fun the next thing he does he goes to India and he stays in India for like a month and I'm like what are you doing in India for I'm Indian I haven't been to India for a month in like 10 years and he's like oh I just love the culture I just wanted to go I know I have a couple of friends that I've met in other travels I just want to go visit their Hometown so he goes to these like remote towns in India and he's learning their way of life and their foods and all this stuff and he's blogging about it and he knows that in India one of the ways that people like they don't have hinge or Tinder in the same way like the the old school way in India is you run what's called a matrimonial ad in the newspaper so this is how my mom met my dad which was uh my dad runs an ad it says you know um 21 years old 6 feet tall you know have a bachelor's degree in engineering um you know good head of hair comes from a good family that sort of thing and Nick finds this so amusing he's like I got to do this so he runs a matrimoni ad and actually he starts AV testing different matrimoni ads and he's showing them to me it's like 5'9 full set of teeth I it's like you know like has a Blog at one point he was like how do I make sure that she's like fit and like not like over wa and I was like we were like uh like could you but like I have to be able to lift you on my like I want to be able to lift you on my shoulders like I'm not strong yeah exactly so starts running these ads but he's not running it like as a prank he was genuinely curious and interested to see what and he just he just over and over again had these little life experiments and just followed he just I the way I text my sister I go I feel like he's just taking the bounce of the ball of life and he's just going with it so for example um like dude you should like start a YouTube channel or something he goes oh I have one I go what I've never seen it and he shows me his YouTube channel do you know what his YouTube channel is I've watched the videos but what do you mean what it what it is it's reviews of like cruise ships of which bedrooms he likes on cruise ships cuz he likes cruises and guess what all his followers are old people who retire and go cruises and they're like thanks I'm going on its Cruise next year I've retired I'm 74 I I was wondering if the bathrooms come with the vanity kit and like sure enough that's what but he's so into it that he just I've always said the best product is you pushed out and that to me is Nick Gray Nick Gray he just took himself and flipped himself inside out and he was pushing himself out in the world and if you love it if you hate it he really could care less it seems like and I just found it I don't know very like eye opening to see somebody who is their own corny self on on full blast and I really admire that for for example he's I'm interested in stocks he's interested in stocks but the way he's interested in stocks is different he is a huge huge fan of one stock you know the one uh Cloud Flair Cloud Flair he hosts his birthday party at Cloud Flair he creates a WhatsApp group of other Cloud filler Believers at every earnings call he texts the group and he says like you know I hope the earnings gods are with us today I'm feeling lucky I'm wearing this and I'm just I I I'm ready for all that this Q Q2 call brings us and he's dude listen to what he whole group he he you know I met Nick Gray cuz we were all blog like 10 years ago and he you know there's like 30 of us friends who are bloggers he went to each of us and he goes I noticed your website is hosted on whatever GoDaddy this or that would it be okay if my assistant transferred your account from GoDaddy to cloudflare will do it completely for free and in fact the hosting property or the hosting thing that you have they're charging you $100 a month Cloud Player was going to charge you $40 a month I went and got a deal I was like why are you doing this he goes cuz I'm a shareholder of cloud flare and I need need you guys to start using it because I think you're going to love it even more dude I swear to God he switched my blog to cloudflare for free and now I'm saving uh uh $600 a year he's like a shareholder of his own life in a way that I am not he's like an activist shareholder it's like he he was like what are the best gyms that have swimming pools and saunas in New York and he found them and they were super busy but what he realized was that the all the gyms had poor SEO and when when he was Googling for best gym and sauna like nothing was really coming up and so what he did was he started writing blogs about other gyms as if they had the best pool in sauna not the one that was near him that actually did so that it would go down in the rankings and be less busy so that he would have it more to himself and these are just like little life experiments he was doing and he made millions of dollars doing this too because he loved museums so he created a business about Renegade Museum tours where he would take you on his own tour cuz museums boring and he's not boring and he would take you on his own tour unofficially not a part of the museum and end up selling that for millions of dollars he like he we did the thing about his gag at the party we're on the way out he's like hey Sean call my phone I've got a gag gag he's like yeah I have a gag I want to do a little bit I'm like a bit are you comedian what's going on and then I call his phone and he whips out this phone case that's looks like a butcher's knife like a machete and he puts it up to his ear and goes hello and he just wanted to make us laugh and I'm like this guy just goes through life trying to make himself laugh I the the the last text I sent my sister I go it's like he you know the movie Limitless it like it's like he took the Limitless pill but instead of it getting he didn't give him any superpowers he just is using that pill to enjoy his life in a way that's wor the rest of us are not and so he broke my frame our friend sahill sahill Bloom um he's got this new stick where he shares like text like he's like in these group chats and I guess he'll say like some inspir ational [ __ ] and then he'll like he'll tweet it out he's like here's what I shared with this chat and it's like like a realization this morning first of enemy I have to say I love sahill so I'm saying this with love but he'll say some like yeah like live laugh love for dudes type of [ __ ] and uh like you know like you know the thing about wisdom is that you only earn it through like hardship like you know whatever and then some guy retweeted he goes bro if a dude said this in my group chat he's getting kicked out right away uh and your sister's reply to that is like like yeah ex she went to it she went to his blog and was just like he looks funny and then moved on with life I was like I just typed you like an essay about how this man changed my life and she's like I Google image searched him you're like dude do you like Oprah cuz I'm doing some Oprah level [ __ ] right here and she just like dismissed you um that's pretty funny nick Ray is the man Nick Ray is the man are we going to do favorite guest now yeah let's do uh best guest and then we'll do best best business idea that we had on the podcast so let's do best guest first who you got this is I worked really hard not to have recency bias but I'm J uh from repet we barely even talked about like the financials of his business but I'm pretty sure it's like a billion dollar company right or like yeah last last round was like right under a billion dollars so like right you know built this huge company I think he's only 36 or 37 crazy smart like his blog is so good he's not just smart like you talk to him like you he like is prolific he writes all this amazing stuff he he said one little small line that like I could have dismissed is like a fortune cookie thing but he was like telling how he makes the decisions based off of what will be a better movie but he gave like eight examples of that and I totally embought in and I thought that he was amazing and one of the reasons was because of that like live life to be a good movie I thought it was fantastic yeah he said whenever whenever I'm at a fork in the road on a decision of what to do in life I just asked what will make the better story yeah and then I just do that one it was great he was so fascinating uh that episode I on YouTube I think it has 200,000 views it was it was a huge hit and it was one of those things where we were recording it and he's like he's low energy and often times high energy people will do better because that's just whatever hell people are but and I was like I am enthralled by this podcast like a lot of times if you spend an hour and a half on Zoom you get tired I was totally excited at the end of that pod and he was a very low M low energy mellow guy and I was like I don't know if this is going to hit or not but I I love it and so it totally hit so lot of people thought he was amazing as well yeah there's almost half a million downloads across YouTube and and audio on that one oh really wow yeah it's at 3:30 on YouTube all right so mine I have two one is the highest viewed episode of the year and one is the lowest viewed episode of the year so I'll start with the obvious one the highest view episode this is the episode I did with Manish P does have two million I think it was it's at two and a half million on YouTube alone wow so it's the first first first podcast episode we're doing this for four or five years now first pod podcast episode that crossed like a million on on YouTube so that was cool to see but in the moment I knew it was a banger like it was the I felt like it was the best best best podcast I've ever done I remember preparing for it for two weeks I flew out there we hired a film crew we went to his house I went to his house the day before and hung out with him to like kind of warm up and prep him like I I gave it my absolute all for That interview and it and it paid off he told he said two things that stood there's three things that stood out to me about him uh he gave this story on the podcast about I was like so what all right you've told me about Buffett You' told me about yourself You' told me about you you know your friendship with Charlie merer like what makes a great investor and he basically was he gave me the keys he was like um you know people think the money's made in the buyer buying and the selling it's made in the waiting and he basically told the story by he goes you ever watch Seinfield you know that episode where Elaine goes on a uh she gets this new boyfriend and it's going great and elae loves this guy and he's he seems so perfect and then they go on vacation together and on the flight she's got like snacks and a movie and like all this stuff to like entertain her he just sits there and he's just staring at the seat in front of him just raw dogging it and she's like are you sure you don't want like to watch this or read a book or you want a snack and he's like no I'm I'm fine and she's like by the end of the flight she's like I got to break up with this guy like this guy's a maniac uh for just sitting there staring at the seat back in front of him what a brilliant a brilliant episode idea just I know right how do you come up with that just like he's perfect except he stares at the C in front of him on a flight yeah she's just like I can't do it I can't do it and he's like that guy would make a great investor if you can have fun watching the paint dry you can be a great investor and my takeaway was like I'm probably not going to be a great investor got it got it it's not me but but at least I I knew what the formula was the other things were by I I've the life hack of going to these people's houses for the podcast hold on that was a really good comment I know what the for that ain't for me but I know what the formula is that's actually pretty cool yeah you know you know the answer same thing with omj goes I've realized you know my advantage my advantage is that I persist I I can push the boulder up the mountain for a long time like I'm just willing to endure and I was like oh okay cool not going to compete with you I can't do that yeah you're like I'm happy I know what it takes and I'm happy I know I don't have it yeah exactly a girl oh she's really into a guy who's you know got these traits all right it's not me good nice to meet you see you later um so going to these people's houses I think is just this life hack where you pick up so much of their energy and their lifestyle and their way of being like I did monish right before I did Joe Lonsdale Joe Lonsdale you go to his house it's this it's this elaborate Mansion beautiful beautiful mansion you know backyard Olympic siiz swimming pool with statues that are shooting water out of their mouth and and he's got like an old gun from the Victorian age and that's like what he's into he's got a full staff that's serving us breakfast and just like full staff that just operates in his house and he's like a high perform perance machine and right after we left Elon Musk was coming over for a lunch with the you know the senators of of of of the area and I was like wow this is a lifestyle that I just it you know broke my frame then I go to manisha's house and we're like hey can we come over he's like yeah sure stop by I'm like is it okay if we come between 4: and 420 he's like yeah come whenever you want and we go over and he's hanging out he's wearing basketball shorts and his his flip-flops and he just took a nap which he does every day and he shows us his nap room and he's like yeah like my whole job is to make you know a couple great decisions a year so I just read and I think and I just try to have a great calm state of mind and I meet interesting people and that's all I do I don't have to like go go go go go and I don't have to beat the Senators and I don't have to have and he shows me his Library where we record the podcast he's got thousands of books he's read all of them and um it was just so interesting to see these different these different ways to win and then you see them up close in person and that's just a very different style just shadowing them for a day like with Joe lale I went in the morning at 8:00 a.m. and I did the morning workout with him and then I had breakfast with him then we jumped to the cold plune all of that before the podcast hanging out with these people was the real win the podcast was just a cherry on top so that was that was my favorite and I'll also give a shout out to the lowest viewed episode of the year that I thought was amazing which was the episode I did with Mike Posner also went to his house and um this had the lowest views because you know he's a rapper musician maybe it's not a fit with our audience I think this guy was amazing he was he was uh an incredible positive guy and he had all these little micr lessons that were amazing two of them that stood out to me one was he has this phrase where he was talking about how he he made this hit song his first song went like quadruple platinum and then he was always chasing that high in his 20s to do it again and next song Went double Platinum but it felt like a failure in comparison next song Single Platinum oh my God he's on this downswing and then the next one didn't even go platinum and he's like the mistake I was making was I would go to the studio try to make a hit and I I went there to try to make a hit song and my M that wasn't how I made my first hit song first hit song I just did what I thought was dope and then then I just started trying to play the game too much trying to make hits and I all I succeeded was making something I hated and I just thought this is such an applicable thing for business especially for people out there who have not tasted their first big win and all they want is a big win or they have a big win and that they need they feel the need to top that with their next one and they start going to the studio to try to make a hit and he said at the end of the day I figured out I'm just gonna make what's cool to me and sometimes the whole world will agree and I just thought that was such a dope philosophy as a Creator to to take which is I'm just going to make what's dope for me and then once in a while the whole world will agree with me which by the way uh like very meta example here the the I don't know how the audio did but the YouTube on this did 13,000 that's like one of the lower in the past year I listened to it and I loved it I thought it was so good and then the comments are um this is the best episode ever uh the second comment this was the best episode MFM episode ever like people loved it in the comments and for some reason it didn't get views that's insane it's also good not to chase those views I think because this is I thought it was fantastic it's weird why do you think it didn't hit to take his approach doesn't matter I just do what's cool to me and sometimes the whole world agrees and sometimes they don't most of the time they don't that's okay and so the the you know the two examples I gave in the monish one okay it gets 3 million plays in that case the whole world agreed but I felt the way about the mik poser one I'm proud of both of them the same because I thought they were both dope all right last two categories best product what do you have I have a lame answer I'll go quick just chat GPT um yeah it's pretty dope it's the same product I would have picked last year but it got way better like the same product it's the same name but it's a totally better product I and I also have found new ways to use it it's almost like you got on Hogwarts and you're learning new like oh you're learning how to use your wand it's like oh wow I got I could do that spell with I could do this with it that's how AI feels to me and I just wrote chat GPT as my my quick way of saying it dude I had a friend over uh some family friends over yesterday for Christmas and he's worked at open AI for four years uh I cornered him strapped him down I just cornered and he's a lot smaller than me and I I had my hand on his shoulder I was like here you go have a seat have a seat sit down there's a computer and here's all L of questions you want to start from the top let's get let's get after it yeah we'll eat turkey later but have a seat it was just pep ring with questions uh I think that was a uh chat GPT is a good one um what was yours best product this thing it says well the focus brick the focus is off it's the brick this is a $29 thing it has some type of I don't know what is it called the RF id whatever so for the audio audio listener Sam's holding up a little tiny Square it's like you know 1 in by 1 inch and this is a thing that just nukes your phone it's basically it's the size of an airpod case and it's a piece of plastic with some type of chip in there you download their app I think this thing is $25 every morning when I'm getting ready to go to the gym I walk by my door and I brick my phone which means it's completely unusable other than making phone calls so my wife can call me for an emergency Spotify and uh my workout app and so I will keep it like that until noon usually so I can't answer texts I can't use slack can't use email no Wikipedia no Chrome all I could use is true coach which is where I have my workouts phone call for emergency and uh Spotify and it is awesome it makes my life a just a little bit better every morning uh I I'm I'm a big fan of these guys uh have you ever used one I've not used it um maybe I should that was a good case it's awesome man you can like I have like a workout setting and then you could have like um driving setting so you could just make it like YouTube and like I I listen to podcasts on YouTube uh so you can have YouTube and Maps available like that's it and so it's pretty cool and I can't uh unbre my phone unless I come home and I scan it again and so it's a it's pretty amazing so that's been my best product and is there like an emergency o like oh for real for real I need Google Maps right now like is there a way to overwrite it if you needed to yeah but I think you only get three times to do that and the third time you do it this brick that you've purchased it's uh useless and so it's just like oh but I bought that thing for $30 I want it to work like that type of like uh uh resistance is is just enough yeah I don't know if I'm built for that level of self-discipline you know back in the day I bought that um wristband called pavlock which is basically like pavlovian training for yourself so it's a wristband where you electrocute yourself uh you get a a slight you get you get a small electric shock not actually that small but you get electric shock in your arm kindur when you do something you kind but you know I was using it for my diet and it's like okay I'm going to eat this piece of pizza and then I got to like volun IL push this button to like shock myself and I just didn't and instead all I used it for was just a conversation piece like I'd be somewhere be like what's that i' be like oh try this on watch this and it became my party trick to be cool instead of having anything to do check it out I'm I'm a freak I'm unique yeah exactly like say you use it I'm like no not at all does it work I have no idea don't even try What's um the hell IO yeah you got you should try this it it's pretty awesome and then the change that you're going to make next year uh mine's mine's fast um I'm getting an office uh I'm sick of like working from home all the time home yeah like I I it's cool a few days a week uh I guess and it's cool when you have to do it uh but yeah I we're getting an office I'm getting an office uh I need to be around people it's just like you know even when business is going well you're like yeah let's get on a zoom and uh but your company is remote so you're going to get an office and then there's local people or what are you do we have 20 employees and like 11 of them are in New York city so we have enough uh and so we're you're not in New York so what are you going to do I live an hour away so I'll just go three days a week oh my God what a horrible decision do I have to talk my friend out of signing up for a voluntary two hours of commuting a day do I need to show him the statistics that show how much you hate your life the like the alternative is that I'm just like in my kitchen and it's like I celebrate with an emoji you know like just lame I let you break your phone I let you care about dressing up I let you do all these things that you know they're they're self harm but I let you do it because there's some greater good commuting two hours a day is a horrible idea you go to your office how often do you when was the last time you saw a cooworker I guess you work with your wife that do count here's what I did which is way more genius Diego who's on this call right now who helps me with all my content he lived in Baltimore as of a month ago and then I called Diego and I said hey Diego how would you like to live within 10 minutes of of me and he's like I'd be down and I go cool how do we do that in the next 2 weeks he's like I guess I'd have to figure out a way to transport my dog and then he quit his job or not quit his job his wife quit his her job he got broke his lease he rented an RV and drove across the country in 7 days and now he lives within 10 minutes of me and we see each other every day we transformed my garage into an office for ourselves and um it's great and that's the way to do it wait so is is the expectation he's going to live in an RV for an extended period of time or is he going to rent a house he got an apartment nearby and uh lives in a cool place and I told him I said hey you're moving to California so here's a pay raise to cover the cost of your move and the and the higher cost of living out here and come live in California who wants to be at Baltimore bro and uh come come hang out with me it's going to be way more fun and yeah that's a good idea we agre to do it was it weird after not doing that for three years or whatever well the weird part is like I realize how how distracted my schedule is cuz like he'll come over and we're supposed to work and then it'll be like oh but I got to like go drop off my kid at school then I got to come back then my trainer comes over and then I work again and then like my kid wants to play like Jenga for a second so like be right back and I realized like oh you know when somebody else is there you're acutely aware that like wait hold on I'm taking a break right here and how many of those mini breaks I had so I had to kind of rejigger that to be a little more Focus time but honestly it was like well it's just better it's it's like all all the times we would be doing calls us being in person during those even if it's not perfect so so you know for example sometimes he just comes and works out of the office even before I'm there I'm dropping my kids off but he's just there he just treats it like an office and then we just happen to be there together a bunch of times but the key for me is I don't have 20 people right so I could do this with because I have two people on my team and that's all I need yeah yeah I I might do it in Westport where I live but I uh you know where I work out most days is the library dude I'm in the library and it's just like me and then like 16-year-old girls no like T like type on my computer like it's like I I I freaking love the library I work out of the library all the time and I'm like libraries have a great Vibe dude it's so much better than like a coffee shop or a Wei work uh libraries are great um yeah there's a there you and I were in Entrepreneur magazine last year and they have a copy of it like they have like a magazine section and uh you know I definitely move that magazine to the front and every once in while I'll read it I'm like but we're not on the cover right we on the inside do you have to open it up I got to open up and when people walk by I gotta be like who's that guy in the magazine is he right there oh what it's him for p 16 yeah oh did you did you just ask me if that yeah it is uh no I like the library what what's yours okay library is a great one um what category are we even on uh change or making oh change I'm making uh this is going to sound stupid but um it's not for me I'm all in on music this year I decided that um I want to be I want to do more music stuff and so I picked up piano again playing and I H so I basically hired somebody to come teach me piano because I did it like in seventh grade and I can play like for relase and that's it how many lessons are you in I'm I'm starting next week and the second one is i i hir a guy cuz I've always like you can now make like most music is now made on a computer and I'm like okay I know computers but I don't know how to make music on a computer and I kind of want to see what's like the latest and greatest of that so I hired somebody who's like you know there's people that know how to like make songs on a computer are you talking about so I'm hiring one of them like beats or like you're going to like record a cover songs you want to write or you want to cover Original start with covers yeah start with covers always and then and then learn to make an original song like that that'll be really fun and so I and the reason why is um well the reason why is cuz it's on uh but two I uh two things are happening one AI is making it easier and easier to make art and software and things that I things that were previously off limits or to would take a lot of skill to be able to do something cool now a little bit of coding skill let you do a lot and a little bit of music skill can do a lot using using these new tools um but also I just like I have a a gym I go to for my physical body I want a creative gym and I got got this idea from Tim Ferris he was talking about how one of the ways he he keeps his mind right and stays in like an awesome state of mind and is able to produce great content and be really creative he works out his creativity he's like and it doesn't have to be in the thing I'm doing so if I'm writing a book it doesn't have to be that I have to just practice writing he's like I might paint or do drawing or calligraphy or archery or anything that is sort of like a a creative gym session yeah and I do that in the morning and he's like it's like when you go to the gym and then suddenly you have more energy and you're performing better at at work why is that same thing with a creative gym session so I I like that idea and I thought oh yeah this is something I could see more people doing in the future it makes sense to me I'm going to start doing this just the way I I I go to the gym in the morning I'm going to go to the creative gym you know two or three times a week and start doing something that's highly creative dude that's so good I think that's fantastic you know um you know Sarah takes my wife she takes piano and singing class classes like lessons and she's on top of it you guys can can Vibe out but what I'm trying to encourage her to do is sign up for some type of open mic night or just like something where it's like a you can have like a recital uh well dude I got inspired by my cousin he did this so I was like oh I'm going to do this and then it's so funny when you put it out there people start just giving you Clues on how to win so my sister was like oh yeah do you know our cousin Neil he does that he's hired a piano coach he's doing it all the time and then he went to an old folks home and he performs there once a week as his recital and it gives them so much joy and I'm like wow what a great win a Stakes way to have a performance that brings other people joy and it's just like so wholesome I was like when you're in my opinion when you're doing these new things you need like um a Capstone you need like an essay you need some type of uh beginning middle and end of like all right I have now achieved level one it's like that's kind of why karate is kind of cool cuz there's belts like you need some type of like break the woodboard at the end well there's like a there's like a belt like where it's like all right I am working towards this nice I crossed the threshold next like a that framework is I think a very helpful you know with writing it's like I want to publish a book it is published like you know there's some type of like uh uh destination I think that that would be cool that would be cool for you and I think it's by the way great like you you get you you and other people tease me for I I like clothing it's it's the same [ __ ] it's just like some type of creative like there's no money there's like it's about the journey that type of like Vibe and it is exciting to like you know Beauty and art like that [ __ ] feels good on soul I think it's great that you're doing this I think that it would be really fun if you had some type of Capstone project thing yeah the other thing I'm doing is I'm taking the Jesse itler 2025 like how to plan your year and I'm actually doing it so like yesterday I was doing his git light part where I'm cleaning out I'm just getting rid of stuff I'm getting light before the end of the year and closing out the year properly I did my thanks stuff and I started writing my thank you notes like I'm I'm buying in and I'm actually doing it so if you want to hear it go listen to the Jesse episode I was pretty inspired by that I this is we a good idea we we have the calendar uh I we use the calendar so like I sit in our little area where we have the calendar I I totally use it I think it's fantastic isn't it crazy how some of these things maybe 26 and 27 year old Sam and Shawn would have made fun of these things as whack 100% and now it's sort of like even like you be like what what is this this is stupid it's awesome isn't that funny how we're like I'm like going to bed early is so awesome I like I used to tell myself all kinds of stories about why I was a night owl how that was more fun how you know it'd be lame to go to bed at if a friend was going to bed at 9:30 I'd be like lame now I'm like jealous if I hear about my friend that goes to bed at 9:30 like [ __ ] how does he do that I need I need to learn this was a great pod what do you think I think it's great it's one of my favorite Traditions thank you everybody for listening another great year in the books the greatest podcast ever created we did something um we had to do this like ad for Spotify and when we did it Sean was like you know Spotify told us to thank you guys but in actuality you should be thanking us because we're the one who just did all the work to like make this content for you but uh I am pretty thankful uh uh um of everyone who works on the Pod I'm also thankful for the people who actually listen to this [ __ ] like it it like it shocks me sometimes when people come up to me still and they're like yeah you said this thing and this thing and like it made a difference to me and I feel so much gratitude when like people do those things and I'm so happy that we're able to do this all right and on that note that's the p [Music]

the marketting me loves everything you're saying around because the two things you just said those were actually like you know $20 million ad [Music] hooks Justin I'm pump here you're here because for well for two reasons the first reason is that you have started like six or seven companies that have collectively done something like $500 million in Revenue in the last 7 years which is huge and they're all in the Health and Wellness space you're also here because you're one of my most reasonable friends when it comes to health and wellness because you are like you're into Fringe stuff which is I think cool but the problem with people who are in Fringe stuff is they can't relate that to like a normal person you know what I mean and they'll be like you know this like Fringe thing that I'm into this is only like a 1% needle mover as opposed to like a 50% needle mover so you're very self-aware you're very thoughtful and you've built a lot of big businesses in the space and you're a blogger and you have this amazing blog post called the uh Great American poisoning that both sea and I are like obsessed with and so I thought you could come on and kind of talk a little bit about the blog post but also business ideas that you're into and opportunities related to this space I'm I'm super stoked to be here I mean I as I've written in that post I literally think that the great what I call the Great American poisoning basically the fact that Americans are sick at record levels and are getting sicker like our children are sick everyone is overrated and obese and these problems are getting worse not better is both the biggest problem in the US and also because of that like a massive opportunity for people that want to start companies uh or or build value in this space Sean what emotion did you feel when you read this blog post dude you could ask Diego I went on like a 48 hour Bender first here's what we did wased in fear no no it was like out outrage first and then curiosity and then and skepticism so here's the here's the series of events Justin writes this post called the Great American poisoning I read it I'm lit on fire Justin this was my I I I did an end of year recap for myself over the weekend it was the number one blog it was my favorite blog post of the year was this thing you did so you you read that and then I I I told my team I said hey let's break this down Point by point because you made a lot of really interesting points if people haven't read it we should pull it up on YouTube but it's like you have this photo of this guy remember you go this guy was considered so overweight that he was like a member of the circus and it's like if you go to a nearby Costco today you'll find you know hundreds of people that more of weight than this guy but that was considered like circus Freak fat before and you talked about how doctors would go their whole career a pediatrician would go their whole career and never see a kid with you know fatty liver disease or these things like that and you're like now it's more and more common and it's just a a very compelling case around health so you you combine three very interesting things one you have a very strong factually based view of Health you are self-actualized around Health you're one of the sort of fittest most healthy guys that both Sam and I know and look up to we I I've messaged you before being like hey water filters tell me what do you like what brand do you like right cuz I trust that you actually walk the walk on it and then third is you're an entrepreneur so you've started two brands in the kind of like keto space each doing you know tens of millions a year in Revenue you know get distribution in 10,000 plus retail stores you started a non-alcohol more than that yeah non-alcoholic uh beverage brand because you're like great drinking is like one of the most unhealthy things we do how do we have the social drink that doesn't sacrifice on health and what I liked was you had no cpg experience before that you had no D Toc experience before starting these you went in and you're kind of like it seems like you to have this great interest and knowledge and you know self hobby around health and wellness but then you've also done it as an entrepreneur so that's a great intersection for us on the Pod because we're both interested in health and like living a good life but also how do we profit from said good life and you've actually done it so I'm excited cuz not only have you yourself had you know three or four big hits in the health and wellness space but you then brainstormed and sent us a of like five or six new opportunities that you think other people could go do in this space yeah I mean you know I I literally think that this space like solving the Great American poisoning there's just almost immeasurable opportunity for people and entrepreneurs that want to solve this problem like uh like I can read some stats off but it's just staggering the amount of chronic disease and the burden that that's putting on the country and so as an entrepreneur like if you see a big problem like that you just want to Sprint towards that and you know not only to say like when you solve some of the problems that are involved in fixing the chronic disease crisis you're also like helping people you know you people are living longer they're living healthier it's a very rewarding SP you know space to work in as opposed to maybe like day trading nfts or something like that and your blog post is basically summarize you said the answer to why so you give all these stats as to how messed up we are but you said the answer to all this is simple our food system is poisoning us and the institutions meant to keep us safe which are Regulators Healthcare System doctors and researchers are not incentivized to keep us healthy which is like the cause of all the problems that you're discussing yeah exactly yeah I mean we we basically we had you know call it a 100 years ago uh our chronic disease burden was like 95% lower than it is right now there were certain acute issues like infectious disease was much more of a real thing there were there were all of these things that we built our medical system on and then life expectancy went up as we got better at solving you know women dying in child birth infectious disease polio these sorts of things now the the biggest burden that we see from a health standpoint is chronic conditions so like cancer asthma heart disease diabetes things like this that have grown 700% in the last you know 90 years and so I think that we are running the the code if you want to call it that of an old healthc care system that existed to solve a problem where you took a default healthy individual they got sick and the job of the medical system was to bring them back to health and now we actually have the opposite which is the average American is unhealthy and like people have not internalized what that means means which is you know you you walk around almost anywhere in the US and the average person is going to be sick the average person is going to get cancer heart disease you know any number of chronic conditions at some point in their life and our medical system is not built to service a population where the average person is sick and so because of that we need new institutions and companies and it it creates a ton of opportunity for entrepreneurs that want to try and address the Great American poisoning by creating products and services uh that help people you know stay or move back to a baseline default healthy space we should get to the ideas cuz they're great but here's like another like oneliner that kind of summarizes uh this which is everyone should update their thinking the default outcome of living in the US today is that you will get one or more chronic conditions and die of cancer or heart disease everything to avoid that is worth considering feel like I'm such a depressing person these days like I talk about stuff it's just like well Justin Debbie Downer Mar's over here all right so um let's do it so what are the ideas where do you see the opportunity you sniffed out the opportunity in the bone broth you know Ketone space you sniffed out the opportunity in non-alcoholic wines each of those is doing you know very very well what opportunities do you see today where what should what ideas you have yeah so I see I see a ton like backing up I basically think that and I read about this in my in my long essay Manifesto but I basically think that that's what way you got to call blogs from now on by the way that's way better it's a little unes but I'll take it you know like in Jerry Maguire Tom Cruz writes his Manifesto to kick off the movie that's this you this is your uh your Jerry McGuire Manifesto exactly yeah this thing was still at work all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity to validate for your next business idea so if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started so if you're interested there's a link below click it and you can have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show so so to back up like my view on what has changed in the last call it 80 years is that we went and humans mostly existed in an environment that was not poisoning people uh to one that is basically poisoning them like food water you know lights air like all these sorts of things uh are filled with plastics chemicals toxins Ultra process whatever that is making the default person sick and so one of the things that I think is really is a really compelling opportunity on that is you could build a massive company in my view that helps people actually look at their environment their home and or their office and say okay you're spending you know 80% of your time in these like three spaces it might literally be like your bedroom your kitchen and your office how do we make it so that these spaces that you're spending time in are maximally healthy and health promoting and I I have a a friend actually who just started a company in the home health testing space that's doing super well they're testing like water air emfs light stuff like that what's it called uh it's called light work it's do lightw work.com so they're doing really well but I think that there is this whole world of Home Services Like Home Services are a $40 billion you know a year in spend where you can think like HVAC Lights Plumbing you know water electricity all these sorts of things where none of these people are looking at how do we actually make your environment healthy none of like the people making your furniture are thinking about all of like the flame [ __ ] chemicals that are giving like babies cancer you know then as they spray it on your couch or so for whatever they're not thinking about that and so I think there's a huge opportunity to build a company uh or a series of companies that looks at what is going on in your built environment in your home and your furniture and all this and says how do we make this health promoting like how do we encourage health and try and make this you know this sort of service one that makes the person healthier so so it's like a an annual checkup for your house yeah exactly I I think like that's the first that's like the input which is do an annual checkup for your house and out the back end of that there's so many long-term Services where you know someone Services your water filtration make sure that your shower water is good make sure like you know your tap water is RO and has mineralization and all these sorts of things what do you do at your house I know you do a bunch of stuff I don't remember everything you do I know you do a bunch but what do you do in your home that's worth it that would be included in in uh your home annual checkup yeah so so I think a couple things are very worth it uh one like water filtration is a huge one uh I basically set up a whole house filtration system there that we had like these plumbers install actually they installed it it was like this $88,000 system they installed it next time they came around to fix it they like screwed on a $20 part incorrectly and I walked into my kitchen the next next morning and I stepped on my floorboards and like water came up from around them and I was like [ __ ] uh so there there's a lot of now you got a a mold issue yeah exactly so we had to handle that which was quite annoying um but we have like every water that is in that is coming in and out of our house gets filtered uh we also recently switched to uh got all of our bulbs um we switched to incandescent actually like I think that there is a very compelling and pretty early line of research that shows the impact of blue light emitting lights which is basically most light bulbs on circadian rhythm sleep uh they they even impact like if if you eat under blue light light versus eating under non- blue light it also seem to impact like the amount of weight that you'll gain uh they use this in agriculture where they use different types of lighting when they're trying to get you know chickens to gain more weight or TR what's a what's an incandescent bulb is that a normal bulb yeah think of like the Edison bulb that it's actually like burning something as opposed to uh an LED bulb which is what's in most houses today there's also there's a pretty cool thing that you can do so LEDs also one of the reasons that I think I felt much better Since switching them out of my house if you have an LED light in your house and you take your iPhone and you film it on slow-mo you can see the LED bulb flickering like thousands of times per second and the reason that led lights are supposedly more more efficient than incandescent bulbs is because they're turning on and off uh all the time and so they're actually like on and using less electricity uh because they're you know they're not on the entire time so they do this sub perceptually which you know can cause people to like feel just icky sometimes you walk into a room with bad lighting and you're like what's going on in my system I don't like this the markety loves everything you're saying around because like the two things you just said and kind of a throwaway thing those were actually like you know $20 million ad hooks when you're talking about do you know how they make chickens fat they put them under these blue lights and actually they gain extra weight maybe that's why you're fat right like have you you ever considered that you're just you're being poisoned by the industry so you have the man is out to to get you people love that you have maybe the problem is not what I'm putting in my mouth it's the light that's affecting and so you it's like oh can I improve can I buy this thing rather than like kind of change from within as like maybe that's 80 90% of the problem but like and no one talks about it except for us in this ad right now it's a secret that you know ex it's a it's a it's a secret they don't want you to know about the LED thing like watch this magic trick of an ad where you take the phone on slomo and you go it's actually flickering do you know how that messes with your sleep with your whatever I love all of this from a marketing I know you're a good e ethical standup guy but when I hear this stuff I think what could I use to get this across how could I if I believe that this is good for people how can I maximally uh you know get that in the hands of people totally I mean and this this is why I think this is such a big opportunity because you have the Home Services thing like the check healthy checkup for your home but once you understand that the impact that some of things have on your health you basically for many of these people they're just like yeah blank check like fix my air quality fix my water quality fix my lighting fix like the emfs in my house you know make sure I don't have mold like all these things there there's a tremendous amount of spend that people want to put into making sure that their home environment is healthy dude I had a Sam have you ever had a pest control guy come to your house there might not be a better salesman in the world than the pest control guy cuz he walk he's like hey you want you want me to just do a quick look around your house just free I'll just take take a quick look see if I see anything of concern like of course and he walks around the house hey I'd love to show you a couple things and then he takes me around the house and he says you see this and there's like a tiny screen that's moved open he's like that's that's you know that's rats and I'm like what rats he's like yeah they're under your floorboards I'm like ew under my floorboard and he shows me all these little things that he's like yeah there's my and look we just live out in like a you know a hilly area there's mice everywhere and he's like would you like me to just come around once a month and spray and fix some of these things for you as if it's be my dad yeah exactly he's like great and now I'm paying $270 a month for this guy to come and do nothing to my house I have no idea what he's doing the random guy comes and sprays but that idea of like let me diagnose the problem so I can sell you the solution is generally a good business model and of course you know like again he's not wrong like there actually was you know issues it's just I wouldn't I would not have been aware of the problem so I'm a big fan of this kind of like audit method of sales let me do a free audit for you to kind of tell you where you might have some problems and then if you'd like me to fix them I'm happy to do so yeah are there any other things so uh water filter light bulbs any other like big needle moving things uh I I think that specifically for your bedroom and places where you're spending like multiple hours um it's kind of early but I think that the EMF thing is going to be much more of a thing that people care about and it sounds very Tim foil Hatty and let me explain like why I think this might be important this is why I I like your opinion by the way you're great at this you're you're like like this is what the freaks think and this is like how it relates to a normal person and like where's the truth someh you know what I mean yeah exactly so so basically like hundred years ago we had the um we had we had a certain type of of radiation that was I believe called ionizing radiation It's that or non-ionizing I don't know this stuff well enough yet but basically it was like think of like what you know you get shot into at a dentist or something like that um nuclear Isotopes things like that things that are definitely bad and then there was this longer spectrum of like microwaves and then things that we would put like self and computers into and for many for many many years we basically were like okay microwaves everything else is fine now we think okay microwaves are bad they certainly cause some harm it's like causes thermal effects in the body let's also not expose people to microwaves at a at a high amount but this other spectrum of like cell phones and like are also definitely fine and then you kind of like get to today which is most of the FTC safety ratings uh and levels that have come up or that that are used to regulate cell phones Wi-Fi things like this um they're basically were tested in an environment on cell phones from like the early 2000s where they were assuming that people would not be exposed to these things for more than like 20 to 30 minutes a day like the the guy who came up with these rules they interviewed him uh I don't know it was like five or six years ago and he was like yeah all of the assumptions that we had around around these just assumed that you like take a phone call and you'd put it down we never thought that you'd be like walking around with this thing in your pocket and there are a Fair number of um s like articles that I think are concerning enough where people will like change the electromagnetic um fields that mice are exposed to and it'll raise or lower their blood sugar at a predictive rate seems to have like potential impact on cancer there's there's enough there that I'm like probably bad it's also I don't think as bad as everyone is like oh my God this is killing everyone and causing every Cancer known to man but I do think if you can avoid sleeping next to a Wi-Fi router or next to something that's like emitting a huge amount of MFS for 8 to 9 hours a night that's probably well worth doing by the way one thing I think we should say you're not one of these guys that's like optimized everything like I've seen you say multiple times you're like you know the just get these core four or five things right and you're like you know you need to sleep well don't e too uh too much processed foods especially seed oils you know exercise get some sunlight like you're very much a Basics kind of guy when in terms of like what's the what should I be focused on which makes me relate and trust you because I think the people that are like well you need to get you know 9 micrograms of sunlight in your eye within 10 seconds of waking up it's like all these like all these Fringe like the Thousand Fringe things you could do to like maybe move the needle when you haven't done the core foundational big things right you it seems like you're more of the get the core right first but am I am I giving you too much credit here where do you stand cuz you're currently saying things like Thomas Edison light bulbs and like the microwave is going to kill you or something where do you stand on this yeah yeah so so I actually think so one completely agree I think if you get the basics right that is like 80 to 90% of it that said I also think if you have relatively easy interventions like move a Wi-Fi router outside your bedroom and you know swap the bulbs in the rooms that you're spending 20 hours a day in like those are pretty easy interventions that are are like one time relatively low cost to no cost and could have a big impact on your health like I'm very supportive of those things I'm definitely not be like butthole sunning solves your entire health issues type of guy and there's a lot of those guys like it it' be cool if it did yeah it'd be amazing doesn't hurt to try though right wouldn't you say yeah I I actually do think this is one of the problems with the health influencer space more broadly is it's just not sexy to be like avoid Ultra processed foods get sunlight in the morning lift four days a week and you know make sure you're getting adequate sleep and so these people get they get like attention from going further out on the the the crazy like claim curve right well you can't sell that right you can't sell that advice you can't even just create content you can't become an influencer to because you'd say everything you need to say in 14 seconds and what are you going to do tomorrow what are you going to post the next day what are you going to post the next day you got you're trying to do this for years and so you have to work backwards from all the people that are trying to sell me something have to sell me something that is complex and all the people that are creating content to try to influence me um that are professional content people they have to have something that's interesting novel and like Evergreen to they have to have more and more stuff to to talk about so no nobody's incentive is to tell you the simple few things that you should focus on and get right because they'd be done you wouldn't sell me anything and you'd be done talking I was trying to find it but Bri I'm on Brian Johnson's newsletter and his subject line for his last new newsletter was Wednesday it says your boners are killing you that was the subject line and it was how the lack of getting nighttime erections is somehow correlated with uh longevity and it was like you're saying it's not sexy to sell just like well this B they got me you're you're right can we do a quick sidebar on Brian so I I like Brian a lot as a guy really nice guy I actually really like what he's doing in general but man I kind of missed the old Brian Johnson where it seemed like he was a missionary nerd trying to do this for Science and now he's like he's like dressed up like kind of modern Zuck where he's got like the chain and the oversized t-shirt and he looks cool and he's selling products and he's got like cool YouTube content he's got great subject lines for emails and he's got a great social media strategy and I get why all that's good but it does make me trust Less in a weird way because he kind of what he was doing before was so different this kind of self-funded science experiment on himself with the noble goal and Noble Mission and I don't know I kind of feel like he's detracting from that I think he he's uh I don't know am I the only one who feels that way Sam Sam what do you think um I have a lot of trust in him still I think that I think that he's done a good job of like he he sells an olive oil that's called snake oil and I think anytime someone makes fun of themselves my trust in them goes up I don't think I have the same concerns as you I think that I have to acknowledge that he's just a weirdo and that's just how he lives his life and that's cool Justin what do you think I I think he's doing an incredible service to humanity like how aggressively he's publishing everything I think that he is where I would say we differ is one I mean one he's trying to build a like longevity cult like new religion which he openly says uh I'm not trying to do that and the second thing is he he's very much a believer in this like the algorithm where like if you live by the algorithm and do everything it tells you like you'll live a longer and healthier life which I think is fair and good and I'm all for that I'm much more interested in like why are people uniquely getting sick in in today's you know environment and what in our environment is poisoning everyone I think Brian Johnson is amazing and like I think it's awesome that someone is willing to try so many risk on Gene therapies crazy peptides like all the [ __ ] that he's doing and talk about it publicly but I unfortunat like I will be very interested to see what happens to him over the next 20 years but I think 20 years of trying very like out on the risk curve therapies uh you know it's quite quite possible something like doesn't go so well yeah maybe I just have a preference for like the autistic biohacker rather than like the uh you know content creator influencer with a DDC brand underneath it I think I've Just Seen A lot of that and the the first thing he was doing felt very original um yeah let me ask you had this great phrase that I think we should bring up which is or maybe was you or it was Cali I don't remember maybe maybe it was your co-founder but the this thing where you said if you had a fish tank and then all the fish inside suddenly started getting sick you wouldn't drug the fish you'd clean the tank right you would assume that there's something that's causing the fish to get sick and for some reason we have this instinct to just drug the fish the fish is fish is sick why are all the fish getting sick I don't know just drug all the fish rather than maybe the tank is dirty maybe there's something in the tank that's causing them to get sick maybe it's what we're feeding them it's their environment and I love that metaphor of cleaning the tank yeah no you capture it perfectly and the only thing I would say is that I don't actually think we have an instinct to drug the fish I think that we have a $4.3 trillion industry that's job it is to propagandize people to think the only way to fix the fish's health problem is drugging them like that that to me is the insane thing that we're you know the insane situ situation we find ourselves in is everyone is getting sicker you know overweight everything I think I asked chat TT recently I think it was something like 60% of people have taken Pharmaceuticals in the last 12 months or like had a prescription something crazy like that it's crazy so let's do the so the first one you had was kind of the cleaning of the tank right check up for the house find find ways that you can make your home environment healthier for you and less interfering with your with your health the second one you have a modern butcher shop so this is about feeding the fish uh what is what is the modern butcher shop opportunity you see by the way Sean do you remember I told you actually last two episodes I I think my two predictions for or two of my predictions were people were going to have more plants in their homes CU it's kind of nasty and also I thought I was like for there's something about the meat at Whole Foods that I actually think is crap nowadays totally yeah yeah I'm not I'm not saying you're right or a genius but I'm not I'm not saying it either I I you know I think I've hung out with Justin before so I'm sure I've stole I stole that yeah I mean so so at a very high level this is one of the things I'm most excited about there's actually one coming in Austin in January which I'm super stoked for um but it's it's the first one that I've seen that goes as far as I would like and and basically let me like set the table through an analogy I I think that like in the 80s uh coffee was basically like folders it was like burnt there was no differentiation on sourcing it wasn't very good to there was no coffee culture and Starbucks came along there was and that was like big second wave culture um kind of coffee and now there's like craft you know Comer and like small like cool Roasters and coffee shops in every major city that you go to I basically think that meat today is where coffee was in the 80s like you go to the grocery store and you're buying meat you're buying like steak you're not no one is differentiating on uh how is this dry AED what is the cut what is the genetics of the animal you know how was it raised was it regenerative was it not was it fed you know soy was it massaged until it was killed and like did a drink ipas until its last day like all these sorts of things are actual differentiators in buying meat and buying steak and people are aware of them but the market has not caught up yet and if you have you ever bought from Snake River Farms or like heard of this company yeah I bought from Snake River what what's their store I just kind of had an instinct when I saw it was like almost because it was the only branded meat that was there it's like all the other meat the The Branding was like 80% 20% right like the the fat percentage and then there was one with like a brand name on it and it sounded like a place and I thought oh maybe this is the higher quality are they legit What do they do yeah they're super legit so they they are one of the few companies in the US that have an American like wagu and so they have a wagu line they imported I believe from Japan some point in the 70s or 80s and they've been like breeding this wagu line if you buy Whole Food's best ribey you're probably going to cost you like 20 bucks a pound or something like this or more if you buy like the best riy from um you know from Snake River it's going to be like $60 to $70 per pound and so the the kind of like skew in pricing and the amount that people are willing to pay for really really high quality meat is massive and I just think it hasn't made its way into retailers hasn't made it way into butchers um and so I think there's this massive opportunity to build like what I'm calling like the blue bottle of the modern butcher shop that caters to people that really care about sourcing flavor cut dry age you know all of these things that you're not going to be able to get at Whole Foods so this there's actually like seems like there's two opportunities one is to create the like another Snake River Farms right a brand that is you know elevated in some some way that would go sell through grocery stores and so just the way we've had you know you know you have oat Le selling oat milk you got you have all these brands that come in new brands that come into existing categories and start selling things that are niche in some way Alternatives in some way or premium in some way what you're saying is a premium meat brand there's that that that's one idea which already sounds like a big idea and I could imagine I could totally imagine somebody who takes a like um a Content approach to this so let's say you were doing this if you go on Tik Tok and Instagram and your YouTube and you're telling your story about the unique things you're doing with your the animals there and why it's premium and maybe it's how you're raising them maybe it's how you're feeding them maybe it's maybe it's like a a version where you're genetically selecting in some way the sort of Premium or you're breeding in some way the the more premium that seems like one opportunity and then the other one you had is the butcher shop which is like you said like Blue Bottle Coffee and bl Blue Bottle sold for what like 500 or 700 million 7 or 800 yeah 7 or 800 and like I don't know if anyone like how popular is blue bottle Nationwide because I had never heard of it till I moved to San Francisco this is like 10 plus years ago I think it's like a big city thing it's like it seemed like a rich guy Pet Project like all the VCS had invested in blue bottle cuz they liked having meetings at Blue Bottle Blue Bottle was cooler than Starbucks it wasn't like it was elevated above that and it just seemed like a passion project and then I see that it sells for $ 700 $800 million and and wow that that thing really worked so I'm a this is like to me this is a 10 out of 10 idea this is an amazing idea I I I agree I mean I think it's a super exciting one I also think that the reason the reason I would personally if I were to start this uh you know start with like a butcher shop or something like that is that with a butcher shop you can actually have a a a pretty wide range of pricing you can tell the story you can try like do small samplings you can talk about the aging and stuff like that if you took a $60 steak in the Whole Foods and just plopped it on the Shelf next to like a $20 one or a $15 one and there's no story ability there that thing just like won't sell unfortunately are are Quality Meats or cows I guess being grown and you just have to Source them or do you have to go and do this yourself uh no so so there are small farmers that are growing really really high Quality Meats they're selling at farmers markets they're just hard to buy from like it's hard to aggregate enough Supply that Whole Foods is like yeah put it in the 500 stores or whatever or you know it can fill up a meat case in Austin and so this really only works um where if you're a if you're a butcher you can buy probably an entire an entire herd or an entire amount of uh farmers of ranchers cattle and sell it through your store over the course of a couple months that is worth your investment from a relationship and like amount that you're going to make on that standpoint for Whole Foods it's like yeah we're never going to work with a small interesting operator that might just have 50 or 100 head of tattle leather sell and can you freeze and store like beef uh and it still be great months later yeah you can I mean the the better thing though is that you can like dry age it and this is the other thing that if if you're taking this like hyper premium approach uh you can actually just hang meat and meat lockers and stuff like that and actually cures gets like a richer flavor uh and the like the more you age it the reason that they don't obviously is like the more that you age it uh the less the less amount of like cash that you're cycling through because you're not selling it as quickly and so it doesn't work for the retail model but if you're doing a really really high-end thing uh like a a butcher shop it could actually work how big is this business you think Snake River Farms I would imagine it's in the like two to 300 million in Revenue range wow I think it's probably massive are they raising but they're raising their own beef though too I mean they have like photos of Cowboys are they like yeah yeah I mean they're they're vertically integrated they've been doing this for a long period of time as far as I understand but I think that there's enough operators like that that don't have the Snake River Farms branding that aren't shipping on dry ice all over the country but that could really like like sell into a butcher shop in Austin Nashville San Francisco LA New York that that just does really well like I'm frankly shocked that the only butcher shop that I know that is doing this is start is in Austin and you know it's opening in like a month and is he trying to just make one or he's trying to make it like a like a nationwide type of thing uh I think there's like bigger Ambitions but yeah starting with just one like let's make it work figure out the economics figure out this business this an amazing idea it's it's it is amazing it's so expensive though and a lot of this is centered around beef only um cuz like I've always wanted to get uh like healthier chicken cuz I I I just don't love eating to beef so previous like again like 80 years ago the food system had diversity there were multiple types of birds chickens things like that today 99.5% I believe of every chicken eat in the US is one genetic breed which is the Cornish cross which is breed for how quickly it puts on weight and the types of grains that it can basically eat and so it's not breed for deliciousness it's not bread for protein content it's not just bread for like any of the stuff that you or I care about is just how quickly can I pack on mass and then I can like sell it uh you know and it gets eaten I think the average life of these birds on average they they're like born to harvest is something like six weeks and so what yeah wait so it comes out of the egg and six weeks later it's big enough to eat and six weeks later it's harvested and sold yes exactly and so this is why I think this is such an interesting opportunity is many people are like I don't like chicken I don't like I don't like you know whatever and they just haven't had chickens that are actually like delicious uh and it's is funny you can read old ads like there was this one um this luxury rail line in the 20s and 30s that made a big deal about how they had they like cornered the market on this one chicken genetics and they served it only in their first Class Cars and all these people were like wow this is the best chicken I've ever had in my life like there's stories like that where it's like what is the wagu or Kobe version of chicken I've never even heard of one yeah exactly no one knows I mean there there's no one that is raising these for slaver dude that's by the way absolute sick burn to call someone a Cornish cross that's going to be my new thing anytime I see somebody that's just you're just a 99 you're just like 99% of the others you're just trying to pack on just pack on mass you're a quick flip of a chicken that's you're just a Cornish cross there's this famous ad there's a guy named Joseph sugerman who um kind of pioneered direct marketing direct response copyrighting in the 80s and he at the time a quartz movement watch was already popular like watch kind of sewers knew about that but it wasn't like impressive like it was just like a normal like table Stakes thing for any watch worth more than 50 bucks but anyway he was famous for creating these ads for this wine of line of watches and he popularized the idea of quartz movement watch as if it was like some like epic thing like and then all the watch connoisseur is like yeah dude they all we all have this but that's sort of like um what you're describing a little bit with these chickens is like you can actually like come up you can if you you can invent interest cool stories that are also true and factual but like you know I think a lot of like the health nuts like they're always like yeah this is standard we don't give our chickens this or that and you're like yeah yeah I know but like most people don't know that and so we're going to tell this amazing story about that exactly yeah and I I think like the mental model is you know you're having a dinner party and it's like pulling out a nice bottle of wine but people aren't drinking and so you're like okay this is this like crazy genetic really nice steak cut and you'll have the best steak you've ever had in your life uh like I think that is the underserved Market that that you could build a real brand around what's your food budget every month and where are you buying are you buying like all of your meat from the Snake River Farms uh no not all of it um I mean their steaks are like super fatty and marbled and everything like you wouldn't want to actually eat that every day but I I basically buy my meat and most of my food from uh local farmers around the Austin area what does that mean like you personally have relationships or you go to a farmers market or what you no so yeah go to a farmers market there's also like a food truck here where it's it's sort of this like refrigerated trailer where they act they It's a combination it's owned by three or four local farms and they just stock it up and so I just go every week and that's where I buy like all of my normal Staples are you just like not eating apples in December or whatever like you can't like I guess if there's Seasons particularly in Austin when it's mostly desert like where does that come from Whole Foods then is where I'll get like the remainder of like the produce and stuff that's not seasonal got it so you do do like some normal stuff and then you also like yeah you know go to farmers markets which is like not extreme but like you're putting a lot of effort into it that's pretty cool all right let's do the next idea so annual home check up I'm giving that a be uh this this blue bottle for uh for beef this blue bottle the modern day butcher shop I'm giving that at A+ is that you want that to exist or you want to invest or you think it's a good business I just see it dude I want it to in I I would be a customer of it I know the I know where the demand is I know a lot of people listen to this be like I'm not trying to buy a $60 steak that's fine there's a lot of people who are trying to buy stuff like that I I know a lot of people that are trying to do that and I just know that when you go into a category where there is no existing brand it is all commodity simply creating a brand in a commodity space is like a winning business formula and the coffee analogy you gave right like I don't know what a folders cost per cup of coffee but I think it's in like the cents so you the idea of going to Starbucks and paying $4 for a coffee that you can make at home for 15 cents or 10 cents or whatever you know sounded outrageous but of course people did it cuz they do it for the EXP experience they do it for a perception of quality so I just see the path of that one and if somebody has the right founder fit and you know it's you need kind of like a one-of-one entrepreneur but that is a to me that's a billion dollar opportunity uh to do that whether you do it that way or you sell into retail and like you said you know you do need to tell the story of why this thing costs more and that's why youd have to tell the story on social media and sell it through retail so you'd have to be great at content on Tik Tok and Instagram and then sell into into retail stores that way but to me that is like a that's a 12 out of 10 idea but you have another one on here calibrate for fertility what is this yeah well quick if anyone does the butcher shop thing I want to invest I think it's such an exciting interesting idea um but so calibrate for fertility you all I don't know how aware you are but basically everyone is having fertility issues right now it's getting worse um you know IVF or what's called ARP assisted reproductive or art assisted reproductive Technologies are growing like 7 to 8% a year and it's accelerating I f is the best in-class option right now and it costs like 20 to $30,000 it injects a bunch of hormones it's super invasive it's super hard you know on the on the female and it's it's just a brutal brutal thing and so I think there is this big opportunity to almost have like a lifestyle set of interventions that are geared towards helping people increase their fertility in the key window when they're trying to actually have kids and so you could think about it like a lifestyle or like a monthly subscription for some 3 to 6 month period where you get a combination of peptid supplements uh people do like an environmental review make sure that you're not wearing polyester underwear while you're trying to have a kid or you know any number of things that actually seem to have a really really big impact on How likely you are to conceive during that window and pretty much just say hey before going the 20 to $30,000 very expensive very invasive very hard IVF route do this like you know several hundred a month sort of lifestyle-based fertility approach approach uh and we're going to try and help you conceive naturally without having to go through ibf I know men can do stuff to increase their sperm count with their sperm count being down that's like a huge issue can women do the same thing yeah yeah I mean women women can improve their fertility for sure uh you know from people even talk about this all the time like stress is a big factor but they're not they're not talking about at the hormonal level like seems like progesterone helps with uh increasing odds of conception uh there's a bunch of interventions that I think are just almost Criminal underutilized Justin have you ever heard us talk about one chart businesses have you ever heard this thing we say on this pod yeah this to me is one so so look at this chart so this is search interest for IVF clinic near me and just look at it since 2018 look at the like relative search volume it's up you know to from 0 to 75 on this chart all the way to 100 on 100 scale of IVF clinic near me which is pretty wild cuz that's not a long time that's something you would expect to see like on a 30-year time Horizon not a not like a six-year time Horizon and what you're saying is there's stuff you can because IVF is obviously very hard on you know it's hard mentally physically emotionally financially hey what if there was a you know an intervention step before that you mentioned calibrate I've never heard of this company what does calibrate do yeah that's a crazy stat that you have on them as well say that yeah so so calibrate was a company uh they they got acquired somewhat recently but they basically started out by being they paired glp1 I OIC with lifestyle interventions and so their whole thing was like OIC people are meant to be on it for the rest of their lives what calib did is said we're going to prescribe you as mic we're also going to introduce coaching accountability lifestyle interventions like this whole Suite of things where the goal is to get you off of OIC at the end of a six or 12 month period like a like a n meets or kind of I mean Weight Watchers is trying to do this yeah exactly exactly and so they those companies always scale Fast N did something similar pre OIC and they were an Advertiser with my old company the hustle like within a year of launching they were spending hundreds of thousands with us this is it's I don't know how these guys grow so so big yeah I mean there's a lot of demand for this and what calib figured out is how to actually get it covered by some ins to some degree by insurers and insurers were okay with it because they're like great we're not going to have to pay 20 grand a year for OIC indefinitely uh we can actually get people off of this this drug after a six or 12 month period And so in the first two years they got to like over 100 in Revenue uh and just scaled insanely quickly it does look like calibrate kind of went went under though or something I don't know I see looking I was looking for their funding stuff but it looks like they they've got restructured private Equity but basically for 20 million they got 75% of the company now so I think it it definitely ran into some trouble some yeah but that means they could be bad operators but the demand still existed yeah yeah that that would be my contention basically is that they were doing this and they launched I think 2021 something like that uh and and I basically think that insurers went from they were like early on the OIC plus lifestyle thing and then there's been this massive record amount of lobbying spent to just keep people on OIC basically forever uh which I think probably did not do them any favors what percentage of people needing IVF you probably don't know this but of like the average age of the firsttime mother has gone up I think it's nearly 30 at this point I think it's 29 or something like that in the' 70s it was 21 um so it's gone up a lot what percentage is it just because of people waiting longer to have families versus like American food system being poisoned it's a good question I I don't know honestly but what I do know is from Reading stats it seems like uh most of the decline in birth rate it's about 70% of it comes from people that previously would have had three to four kids now having one or two and so it's not like people are deciding not to have kids they're just having fewer and I do think that the biological fertility issues are a huge huge amount of what is driving down the average number of of kids that uh you know a family or a woman has these days dude it's pretty crazy how many of my friends my male friends tell me that they're like like in in Austin we used to go to the sauna all the time and I would have so many friends that like uh I'm not going in the sauna this week we're trying to get pregnant my balls aren't working and so I'm trying to like like I can't cook them right now you know what I mean like there were so many people that I knew you and I Justin are friends and they were like uh I can't do this I can't do that I need to go do this because we're we're struggling and it's my fault it's pretty wild Sean have you had a bunch of friends that have like complained of similar stuff they're like it's my stuff ain't working you lost me at have you had a bunch of friends so no I I think it is this like under the radar thing very few people are talking about but almost everyone I know that is trying to have kids right now has some amount of fertility challenges uh and even if that's six to 12 months and then they get pregnant even still you know if you do that across like two to three kids you're basically going from you're now having one to two kids instead of like three to four if every time it takes you six to 12 more months to get pregnant so you've mentioned three kind of health related startup ideas you've started I think four kind of successful that I know of uh health health related companies can you describe this approach because I'm the kind of guy that bounces around from industry to Industry model to model I'm like I'm like a variety seeker and I don't think that's good like just when I learn about a space I get intrigued by something I'm a beginner in and I go in and I'm I stop the compounding of that so I don't think that's too smart can you describe your approach to entrepreneurship versus you know somebody like me who's just bouncing around and trying 100 different trying to solve aund different problems in a 100 different spaces with aund different business models totally yeah I I think for for me at least what has been very rewarding is basically choosing one problem which for me is the chronic disease crisis that I want to spend the rest of my career on like I I think that there's a massive amount of compounding like relationship compounding even personal brand compounding like people think of me as like into Health which pays some dividends that's probably going to you know be even more so over the next decade um you understand the space you understand the problems you understand the players and relationships like I think that if you decide this is the problem that I am the most interested in the world that I deeply care about that I read about for fun and just Orient your career around trying to start things or be involved in things that make that problem better or solve that problem like you get so many shots on goal even if they may look different like I started Kettle and fire thinking like the American food system is poison uh and there needs to be a bone broth company what did you read or consume that made you buy into that and then how long were you into it before you're like this is my thing yeah so I was going to CrossFit in San Francisco in 2015 and a bunch of crossfitters were like you should do bone broth I a ter cook I'm like almost never cook for myself and so I basically was like great I'm going to go buy some at the store and no one was selling some and so after that I was like seems like there's an interesting opportunity here and did I think it would grow to like p a n figure annual business definitely not but it was a big enough opportunity that decided to take the swing but did you get into health and wellness because you like that seems like a cool opportunity or were you're like I'm obsessed with this topic and this is like a really good way to address it uh yeah I was I was just obsessed with the topic basically like I'd been reading about paleo and reading about um you know all these sorts of things since I was basically in college like I was a weird dude in college who my senior year I went paleo and so I like wasn't drinking beer wasn't eating pizza or french fries all my friends were like the hell's wrong with you like what's going on and so I I just got very into this idea this like Secret in a sense of like why is everyone getting sick at record levels and what could be kind of underpinning that uh and so it was this deep interest and as I got deeper deeper understanding and appreciation of the problem I just really understood like this is literally I think the biggest problem in the country and I can spend the rest of my career trying to solve or take stabs at various instances of this problem whether that's starting a brand or trying to fix like the incentives through Tred um you know I basically was like I think I'm just going to try and solve or work on fixing this problem for the rest of my career so let's go back to that kettle and fire example so you you you're doing CrossFit trying to live healthier crossfitters are telling you should do broth you're like cool where do I get some of that and you go you look there's not like an easy brand that you could just pull off the shelf and buy it so you think somebody should do that now at that time you've got no experience doing that you've never built a DDC product you never built like an actual you know consumer brand can you just describe like the the three or four bullets that happened that first year to like make it happen like cuz I think you know all these ideas are cool but you got to be the type of person that can make [ __ ] happen you made [ __ ] happen at that stage can you just describe what what you made happen for Kettle and fire yeah totally so we basically we first tested a landing page put up a landing page with no product started buying ads to see like who would click on it what would they pay you had the brand name at that time we called it bone broth Co which was a horrible idea had since rebranded the kettle and fire you just made it yourself you just mocked up an ugly landing page yeah mocked up an ugly landing page on unbalanced paid someone on five or $10 to make a terrible logo and basically started selling a box at $29 9.99 and when you say started selling what Facebook ads how'd you get the traffic yeah we did Facebook ads and Facebook and adwards and then some Bing at the time because they were like there was an ARB there it's much cheaper dude bing bing clicks back then I I they were so cheap and they converted way higher I don't I know I was always like I don't know who people are but they're in what was that first few weeks or maybe month like that gave you the was were you looking for conviction or you already had conviction what what what happened in that first month for you that yeah I was I was looking for conviction so basically we' put in uh $500 we built this landing page and I think sold like a little over $2,000 worth of product inside of about of a month and so I ran the numbers and I was basically like okay we can build a business and I think just given existing traffic we can turn this into at least like a two to 300 Grand a year kind of business and based on like what I felt the margins would back into I was like that would should be about 100 Grand 150 Grand a year in profit which seemed like a worthwhile thing to take on and then what uh okay so you you do you do that and where did it get much bigger than that what what happened to make it much bigger so we validated the idea uh the next thing is we did we had to figure out how to make it and so we emailed and called over 500 different manufacturing Partners to just like please someone help us figure out how to make this product and eventually what ended up working is my brother who was 19 at the time who I co-founded the business with he emailed Mark hbin as like I'm a 19-year-old entrepreneur like please help and Mark Cuban introduced us to a manufacturing partner who we ended up working with and still work with today to make our first like version of the bone broth product and so wait wait what did you what did he your brother's like hey Mark we're entrepreneurs but we don't know how to make a product do you know any bone broth manufacturers and he said yes here's one he was like talk to my food person and then his food person introduced us to our co-actor was like yeah you should talk to this this group over here and just to clarify that those first $22,000 were the orders did you just go refund them because you didn't have a product yet I I emailed all of them and I said hey we're not going to have a product for like six to n months I can either refund you in full right now or 50% off and we'll we'll like eventually ship it and people that didn't respond I would just refund them yeah okay great so Mark hubin gets you a food uh person so that's the second thing that now now you know how to now you can get the product made yeah and so and then basically uh what I realized is the product is two-ear shelf stable I put literally every dollar of my life savings at that point I was 25 uh into doing the first run of our product they $30,000 minimum runs uh it was like 120k uh kind of run budget so I was like either this is going to work great or I'm going to eat bone broth for two years either way I'll I'll like feel pretty good uh and so we bought the first product and year one we basically did 2.8 million in sales um and after about six months of being in business one of the buyers at Whole Foods saw an influencer talking about our product reached out and was like Hey I want to bring you guys into Whole Foods and we basically we we did extraordinarily well in Whole Foods and uh got National rotation following year and that just kind of like started our our journey I think I was with you eight or 10 months after you started it in San Francisco we went bowling I don't know if you remember that and yeah you were telling me about this and I was like oh I mean it seems like you got a really good career why are you throwing it away at this like I just remember thinking of like what uh like why does he want to ruin everything yeah starting a b rooth company in SF at the height of like the tech boom was definitely not a consensus opinion my sister when she moved to San Francisco she had uh she was do working in a corporate career she worked for deoe I think uh so she was like a Management Consultant she had gotten her MBA she had gotten got an undergrad in electrical engineering got an MBA from a good business school was a Management Consultant and then she um she's like she's like I'm sick of this life I want to I need a business that I can own and not have to go to a job every day and she was so tired of like the Consulting hours were so bad that she would come home and her like her her kids would be asleep and she would just pick them up from the crib just to hold them for a few minutes cuz like she hadn't been there when they to like even play with them before before bed and like after four nights of that she's like never no I'm not doing this and never had started a business before decides to start a um an inhome daycare so she kicks me out of the apartment I'm living in and says I'm going to use that apartment which my my parents owned uh apartment they're like she's like kick you out I'm going to use that to start this business and I'm GNA she needed six kids so six kids to come to this like inhome daycare and my dad was like you have an electrical engineering degree you have a job that pays you whatever 150k a year you're a Management Consultant and you're going to change diapers and she just felt so bad you know quote unquote throwing it away and then you know fast forward now she's got like three or four schools in San Francisco and she's been able to like scale this business up she works just like a few hours a week and has like this amazing business and um a lot of the I say that because a lot of people will hit that Crucible moment where it feels like you're throwing away this known and socially accepted thing to do this kind of Fringe weird thing from scratch on your own with no safety net and I'm not saying that it always works out but every time something works it almost always has that story at the beginning of like you you're doing what and that's totally normal even though it feels abnormal in the moment feels bad in the moment totally and I Sam I'd actually love your thoughts so my experience frankly was almost every single person that I knew who was starting a business or or trying to start a business like between 22 and 25 has made it in some way shape or form like it's insane yeah so Justin and I both started roommate matching companies we were both we are both 20 and so between the ages of like 20 and 25 we were like in the same industry and so all of our SF friends uh you know are were similar age and um dude it is crazy how many I actually just tweeted about this today I was like I grew up in SF from age like 20 to 30 it's crazy how many of our are successful just because they're around you know what I mean yeah totally Nal has a great phrase where he says yes you hear the stats about startups oh 90% of businesses you know new businesses fail and he goes yeah startups fail but Founders don't and I love that phrase because he said oh basically if you just fast forward 10 years any of the founders that stayed in the game like the success rate goes from your first business success rate might be 10% but the 10-year Saga of you trying a bunch of shots on goal and getting smarter every year like the odds are now like if you just look at our coher friends right Sam we were in a mastermind together back in what was that 2013 something like that like our cohort of friends which is probably like you know 30 to 50 Founders that we used to hang out with and know regularly the hit rate's like 80 or 90% success rate you know for the people that actually stuck with it I got a couple friends that packed up their bags and moved to you know Connecticut and just said you know if I'm not doing this anymore um not you Sam sorry I just like literally I'm just thinking of like a couple of friends that did that they were just like hey like the San they're burnt out from San Francisco startup culture those people you know they didn't fully make it but all the people that stayed in the game made it we could like wrap it up with one quick story which is uh I remember gagin bie started this thing called udem me and it was like courses what this is like what Tai Lopez does and I remember um both Justin and I were like I guess we should get in on this like this seems like a really good way to like make $100 or $300 a month which would be like lifechanging and so we both did that stuff and I think that you know I I could say for Justin for sure people look up to you and me I look up to you and I admire you it's crazy how like if you look at like 8 or 10 years ago which wasn't that long ago you were doing many things that uh like you know people like well poo poo like maybe course creation or like buying a car and renting it on Toro or whatever and it's like man the people you admire start way scrappier than you think I know I for sure did yeah I mean I don't know that anyone admires me that's taken my keyboard shortcuts for Mac users udem me course but uh definitely I was hustling back to um have you ever read uh Travis colanic the guy who started Uber his his old blog he had this amazing blog that he was it called like awesomeness bro it was called like something silly like that right it was he heavily bro out um but he had this plog post was just like attending CES on the cheap or like South Southwest on the cheap and it was basically like his playbook for how to have a badass time at a conference when you have no money and he's like all right here's what you're going to do you're going to get to the airport but never never take the tag here's what you can do instead here's what you're going to do for for staying at someone's house you know here's how you're going to skip the event but still get in to the Afterparty cuz that's where the magic happens when you get there here's what you're going to say and he had this like really Scrappy approach to how to just like you know wedding crash a a major conference on a budget and he was 31 years old by the way he was 31 when he wrote that post it's not like he was a college kid and he also used to invite people to just stay at his house in San Francisco part of the magic of a city like San Francisco is like he used to say if you're and in the reverse was if you're coming to San Francisco and you got no money and but you're a Founder he called his house the jam pad and he would have like people constantly just coming and crashing on his couch and he would host people over late into the night and everyone just jamming on different ideas and he used that to kind of build his momentum his Network his energy it is pretty wild yeah so cool can we finish with this Zuck story Zuck is auctioning off his gold chain for you for your charity what what is this well I saw you tweet that uh Justin I was like is that real did you just and he totally downplayed it you said zuck's Ox oing my chain and no one like it looked like no one replied to that yeah I had a bad twitter day that day I saw people were bidding for it how much did it end up going for it's his almost 41 Grand but oh wow who won do you know uh some Anonymous person I'm not sure but we basically probably a crypto person to be honest um but yeah so a couple years ago three years ago I started something called inflection grants which which is effectively just giving small like $2 to $3,000 grants to people under the age of 24 that are high potential uh you know it's inflection grants.com if anyone wants to check it out but basically someone made an offer to me when I was in my 20s uh when I was like graduating college where he was like hey you should keep running with your startup if it doesn't work I'll just write you a check and you can use that to cover your living expenses until you find a job or whatever who did that and why it was a mentor that I had built a relationship with in Pittsburgh where I was going to school yeah I think he just knew that I wanted to be an entrepreneur also saw that I didn't come for money and I think knew at this very key time that that offer would make a big difference and how in my decision-making and he was right and so I started inflection grants three years ago since then um you know we've given out like 50 grants and long journey who one of the GPS is Ariel Zuckerberg has gotten behind it in a big way and uh so this year Ariel convinced Mark to auction off one of his already worn gold chains and then we had to make sure that was cleaned no DNA residue anything like this but uh sold you know did you really did you actually have to like for sure you get did you get to talk to him at all uh no no but yeah he gave it away and we actually offer 41 Grand which goes the charity which is great so that's 20 20 people are going to get these $2,000 grants exactly you gave us this document before we started and I think we only touched like a third of it there's so many more cool things that you have to come back and talk about like a lot of people don't know this but Sean did you know that Justin was like a co-author on the book traction with the duck duck gounder like there's like there's like there's like five or 10 other things that you have really amazing stories behind and are really insightful on and so uh thanks for coming on and doing this um I'm like literally sitting here taking notes on like incandescent bulbs and uh like farmers markets and [ __ ] like that and uh you're going to be getting a lot of uh follow-up texts on me where it's just like Justin just tell me what to do tell people where to where to follow where to get more uh yes so I'm substack justinm sub you know. substack do.com I write a monthly newsletter on health and business stuff and then also on Twitter at JW Mars and go read the Great American poisoning we didn't do it justice in this in this podcast but go read that blog post it is amazing we'll put the link at the show notes to that specific blog post all right that's it that's the pot thank you [Music] Justin for

so this Christmas tree thing is kind of crazy the story is this article that I read in curbed basically it's talking about the brutal Mafia style business of Christmas tree sales in New [Music] York and I'm just going to read you a paragraph here that just captures it it goes Christmas trees are a big business in New York a lot of people see the quaint little Shacks that appear on the side of the road just before Thanksgiving with a bunch of trees and you think oh these are probably independently owned Maybe by Jolly families of lumberjacks looking to make a few holiday bucks that's what I thought anyways in reality a few eccentric obsessed and sometimes ruthless tycoons control the sale of almost every tree in the city they call themselves tree men and they spend 11 months a year preparing for Christmas time which to them is a 30-day Sprint to grab as much cash as they can I'm in you're in right dude this needs to be a Netflix show right yeah and is this the one about this guy named Scott well there's a bunch of guys so it talks about like the different guys because they basically carved up the territor like you got Harlem this one guy gets Manhattan this other guy's got the east side and they all have different territories and they all have crazy names so it's like George Nash and Kevin hammer and it's like oh yeah Nash got Harlem he's a smooth talking hippie from ver Vermont Hammer is a Brooklyn Born Scientologist who was a powerful force in the business he's the one who shaped it Hammer is rumored to own half the tree stands in Manhattan bringing in more than a million dollars every December the lore is Hammer lives on a yacht somewhere in the Atlantic and he visits New York only at Christmas time where he HS up in a Midtown hotel room with a pile of cash on the bed and a Pitbull squatting on either side of them like is this even real what am I reading sounds fake dude if you sell a million dollars of trees in one month like with all your expenses like that's like a like a like a like a $150 $200,000 a year salary yeah way more AA yeah you might have a pull but they're a going to be piles of cash or a yacht like 50% I could see there's a world where there's like 50% margin all in well you ain't owning yachts in Manhattan when you put on 500 Grand a year doing it for like 20 years this is an old article um so I think uh yeah it's pretty crazy so then it talks about like basically one interesting thing is it talks about the history of the Christmas tree so it says 200 years ago the idea of putting a tree inside your apartment would be a bizarre decision didn't make any sense this supposed to be shelter from the outside why would you bring a tree in and it talks about how like Christmas trees or trees themselves weren't even really associated with Christmas time and then it says that started a change in 1851 there was a Dutchman named Mark Carr who was like I think I can do this what's doing this uh like selling trees to people to for the spirit of Christmas and so he goes um he's considered the father of Manhattan Christmas tree business and we don't know much about him but basically the way it describes him is he was out of work and he was he realized that he could chop up a tree from the forest bring it into the City and try to sell it to the people in the city to have like a piece of like you know nature with them and he goes and he tells his wife she's like that idea sucks this is the great story of every entrepreneur tell your wife an idea she says it sucks and you do it anyways I think that's the real American dream and so he comes in and he basically tries to associate these trees with Christmas spirit with the Jolly uh winter time and he goes and he uh he bought a got a permit for $1 to sell it inside Washington Market the which was like their wholesale Bazaar and he starts to explain to people there that these are trees that you can stand upright in your house and it signifies Christmas and he sold them out in a day and that kind of started the the trend of indoor Christmas trees again assuming this article is not fake completely and the onion my parents us to do this for a living they owned a Fruit Stand you're just sitting on that fact for 5 minutes while I'm making up [ __ ] about the Christmas trees no so to this day I've told you my father's a produce broker so basically these are madeup numbers but hypothetically he'll uh buy a million of onions from a farmer and then organize a truck to go pick them up and then sell that load of onions to Walmart for $1.1 million and hopefully make $100,000 in profit of which 50 goes to the truck or whatever you know madeup numbers uh but the way he got into that was my mom and dad owned a Fruit Stand like on the side of the road and that Fruit Stand made a lot of money every October by selling pumpkins and every Christmas selling Christmas trees and my mom would tell stories about like getting up at 5:00 a.m. in the morning in order to like flip the pumpkins cuz I guess they can't rest on one side for too long otherwise they get lopsided and they would package up these trees and they would just sell a shitload of Christmas trees and that would like make their Q4 I am fascinated by these uh kind of once a year businesses like Michael girdley came on the podcast he was talking about his fireworks business where 99% of the revenue happens the day before July 4th right like it's like July 3rd is 99% of the revenue it's like what a make or break what a like high stress but also you know kind of peak season versus offseason style of business and those kind of fascinate me we've talked about before like I think one of the great side hustles is going around the neighborhood and basically saying hey like do want us to put Christmas lights up for you we'll put Christmas lights up like I think you can make you know tens of thousands of dollars in a six-month Sprint if you just wanted to go knock on doors and and ask you know the same question over and over again and I think that uh like there's a guy in our neighborhood Who basically does that you know he hits up he gets like 50 houses to say yes to this thing each one of us pays you know I think I paid like 1,700 bucks for like a basic Christmas lights thing that took him you know and then and and the guy who was knocking on the door wasn't even the guy who put the lights up so I don't even know if he was just like a lead gen guy I don't know who he was but you know I respect the hustle all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can

if you're interested there's a link below click it and you can have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show what's this um Health startups that are have wild traction so there's a couple of Health startups that just caught my eye as um normally there's a bunch of these ideas that sound really great and then they just never work and a lot of them are like and they're all the things that you know basically a rich smart San Francisco LA New York type of person does or wants in their life and they think that everybody does and wants that and that it could be accessible to all of them but actually it's too expensive and too hard to do and too bespoke and all this stuff ideas that fall into this category were like music Discovery and then there's like let me give you a good example this was a headline of Business Insider billionaires plan to launch a media brand around the the zeit guys of Brooklyn exactly a billionaire launching a media company about how Brooklyn is where it's at that's the worst that that I'll take how to lose $50 billion for $100 Alex you know the Instagram co-founders after Instagram um their like Revenge company was this newsreading app so they basically they they got they they quit Facebook and they were like ah Facebook is kind of bastardizing Instagram they're just copying Snapchat and like all this [ __ ] and they were kind of like making these lowkey like passive aggressive remarks and then they were like we're doing it again and they they did this photo shoot of them in their like you know like in their vacation home where they get away when they want to be creative and they say they're going to like try to change the way that we consume news and make news you know less biased and more like easy to consume and all this stuff and like of course you know two years later they shut it down because that's again this kind of like smart wealthy well-meaning person trying to solve a problem that they have but that not a lot of that it's not basically it's not junk food like people want junk food people want Cheetos and they want the Cheeto dust on their fingers and anybody who's like I'm going to take the te dust off their fingers they just don't find a lot of demand typically okay so this is like what I this is like one model of the world I have and then there's but then you always pay attention to what's going to break your frame where am I too biased where have I locked in and and maybe the world is changing underneath me and so there's two Health startups and so Daniel e who is the founder of Spotify who is awesome guy but he checks a bunch of the boxes right billionaire who's you know coming off of a you know huge you know life altering you know win of a company and he's been Rich since he was 21 been Rich for a long time obviously is at that huberman phase where he's like you know what I need to like take care of my health I need to get a protocol and like I'm G to start taking these like you know I'm G to start taking drugs that nobody can pronounce and like I'm going to do all these things right and that's like a normal thing that like you know I'm biohacking and like the protocol phase of life like yeah exactly so he's in his protocol phase and so he he launches this thing called Neco health and and it even had like the other kind of like uhoh warning signs where it's like he's not really running it he's like a part of it but he's like wait you're running Spotify so how are you going to do this like oh there's like a team that's running it okay so maybe this operator model who knows we'll see what happens so you know there was some warning signs instead there's this post that came up so he posts on LinkedIn and Daniel posts over 60,000 signups in just 12 weeks it's been only 3 months since we launched Neco Health in London the response has been nothing short of incredible over 60,000 people have signed up for a scan which reflects a growing shift towards preventative Healthcare and early detection and I think it's sort of like you know maybe prenuvo ask dude that by the way I think that's [ __ ] getting 60,000 email subscribers I don't think that's particularly maybe um because like if you go to the website like it's the craziest awesomest thing you could imagine it's a $250 St uh scan right so let's just say you know the full value of this is $15 million pipeline in in three months now you're saying okay some of the people are just looky lose sure of course um so not all these people are going to convert okay fine even if it's 115th of that if they booked a million dollars in bookings for this thing in 12 weeks for a single geographic location in London that's kind of interesting to me that's not nothing right that's not like this pie in the guy thing what's it do I think what they're trying to do is they basically they're going to scan your body they're going to look for moles and they're going to look for look at your arteries and your cholesterol levels and all this stuff and they're going to be it's like a better health check okay so and it's preventative it's not like normally you know normal Healthcare System is you have symptoms we sort of tell you to take two Advils you come back you're like hey I still got the symptoms and they're like okay well uh let's check some basic things here in the office and then you're like dude I really think something's wrong like all right go get a scan right so when you're broken you get scanned and the idea where Healthcare is going is like you get scanned before you're broken to tell you where you might break or what's starting to break so that we could fix it earlier right obviously like anybody can agree with that idea but actually doing it and making it work both technically and building the brand around it and getting consumers excited about it and getting enough funding or getting enough Revenue in the door for this to be a real business it's pretty impressive to me okay so so that was the first thing that happened that that little post the second thing was I'm an investor in this this thing called superpower have you are you investor in this I think you told me about it and it looks amazing so superpower. comom so it says a new era of personal health the world's most advanced digital Clinic to help you live longer prevent disease and feel your best okay ignore all that ignore all that all it is is a 10 times better version of an annual physical okay I like that okay you're getting an annual physical anyway if you're if you if you're bought into the idea of I should get an annual physical here is a better ual physical and they're like okay what's a 10x experience of the annual physical and by the way I love that idea the Simplicity of that pitch of that of that of that uh Mission I think is really really powerful and the thing costs uh like I don't know like 400 or 500 bucks so it's like I I would be willing easily to pay dude you're on their homepage right below uh Mark Zuckerberg's uh sister and right next to the winkl Vos twins oh hold on Mark Zuckerberg's sister well okay well still pretty cool my excit went up and down you're right next to Mark Zuckerberg sister shout out to what's Ariel she's cool actually I met her I met her at a party she was she was actually very cool okay yeah me and the winkl Vos Twins and then a bunch of MDS and bology okay so okay so let me just tell you a little about this so they sent this investor update I think I'm allowed to share this so Jacob one of the founders he sends this investor update and I invested in this thing like a little while back didn't kind of hear about it they were like working on it like honestly was like all right we'll see when this thing comes out and here's what they said they go the best doctors in the world already offer this today but having a coner doctor who does this type of type of work for you can cost like 100k plus it's right it's only for rich people so our job is to make that available to everybody okay so then by the way I'm going to my concierge doctor tomorrow for my checkup and it's not $100,000 what do you pay 20K a year no maybe 5,000 a year that's it yeah yeah yeah yeah but that's okay I don't want fact have a do yeah I found him in the Yellow Pages uh no I don't want have a friend who has petera as his Doc and I think it's a quarter million dollars a year so there's a range and you're on one side of that range you're not in the middle that's the good news I'm definitely on one end of that bell curve not the good one they wrote These stats and they were like we had 3 million hits to our site during launch week wow I was like what and they said our weight list has grown to over a 100,000 people what I was like what is going on and so I emailed them and and their their product is the first product of the membership is a 10x better version of the annual physical and so basically it's like is that the language they use in their in their documentation or you just saying this is just 10x better this is this is what they said to me in an email got it um and they're like you know basically you're going to get 100 plus lab test a full body report an hourong consult with your doctor uh a limited QA with your doctor throughout the year uh additional Health uh consults and and whatever at Insider prices for 499 bucks okay I like I kind of buy this value prop right like I think that's going to work um and so I was like dude that's pretty crazy like like how can you even offer this for 500 bucks secondly did you say you had 3 million visits during launch week and 100,000 person weight list like how did you do that because yeah I tweeted your thing out but like you know as much as I love to Pat myself on the back I don't think I can I could help anywhere near that type of those type of numbers and they were like yeah like basically in the first three or four months 100,000 uh 100,000 people signed up for this thing so superpower. comom their site is beautiful uh but the way to you you can click join did you say thank you yeah yeah that's my thing noway I'm just I'm slipping in thank yous and your welcomes when people are not trying to give me compliments it's great with near 0.1% of the uh of the reason why it looks good you know like you you we are doing we have 100000 person yeah uh do is it in person so like is the checklist done or sorry is the checkup done in person no so how do they like like you know like do the thing where I like cough or I think I I don't know because I I haven't been a customer yet I'm on the wait list still but I assumed it's like those other like all tele medicine where basically let's say they they send you to a diagn like you know a quest type of thing to do the blood draw got it order your labs and then there's a doctor remote who's analyzing your Labs who does the call with you does the consult talks to you all that stuff understood okay I don't think anyways I thought that was pretty crazy traction because I was like dude if I was like let's just take the total potential value of the pipeline you're saying during launch week or during this like kind of first couple months after you just announc the company you have $49 million of potential Revenue in the in the list which of course only a fraction of a fraction is that is that going to convert but I mean still just like really impressive these so a lot of these Health startups that I thought were kind of like wishful thinking I think something has shifted in the culture where Health startups are no longer wishful thinking and people are legit willing to pay and you see this with content you see this with huberman with Peter AA with Brian Johnson I think you just I think there's a shift happening where health is cool health is in and whatever that next layer like the market you know that next segment of the bell curve that's interested in this but it's a big like sizable chunk um I feels like another part of the bell curve has gotten unlocked of people who are willing to spend what's the early adopter phase is it like like it's like Freaks and then it's like early adopters and then it's like everyone like what is it what's like the we should rename all the segments yeah yeah like like [ __ ] quacks of weirdos people you hate to talk to yeah like you know innovators that's the one you're talking about yeah all right so the Freaks and Geeks and then there's early adopters which are wannabes that's us so we we we keep an eye on what the Freaks and Geeks are doing and we start to you know half ass copy them um and then there's the early majority and the early majority is kind of like you know the smart reasonable person and then you get to late majority and and then the laggards which is like you know your your mom who still has a newspaper subscription and you know whatever else AOL email address my mom does actually um and I so I I I would say I'm early adopter sometimes I'm uh the innovator for some of these things and I think what's going to happen based off of my pattern is I think a lot of these things are oneoff stuff so I have tested so many different blood work companies just because they're the latest and greatest and it's exciting to try something new in general I've not had a huge amount of repeat purchase for uh many of them for some of them I've like for for example do you remember Forward Health mhm like I like something like that I was like oh I'm actually in or remember one medical which is um you know like popular now uh we've been pay I've been a paying customer of theirs for like 5 years so some of them I become like recurring customers but I love trying new stuff what I think is going to happen is now it's shifting to now the uh one past the early adopters they are now open to trying this stuff and so I think getting a weight list I actually think it's less challenging than it appears but making it so you come back every year is really really hard and it's going to be interesting to see who can pull that off because I've done the perovo I've done uh in you know insid tracker have you or yeah like I've done everything and they're awesome it's just a matter of like which ones do I rely on every quarter or every year as opposed to I just found some new drug and I just want to stick it in my body this one time just to see what's up and I like I'll never touch it ever again there's a lot of people like me who do that by the way yeah yeah you're in the on the fitness and health side I would say you're in the Freaks and Geeks category right you were telling me about like look dude I injected this stuff in my butt and I don't have cravings anymore and V you were talking about OIC before OIC had like a brand name you're like I read about it on a forum and it's amazing I don't eat candy anymore this is going to change the world I think I told you about that in 21 I think it was summer of I think it was summer of 21 and um or something like that maybe 22 and I remember telling you when I was like when I put this stuff in my body it feels like uh people who have alcohol and addiction issues I think that's going to go away and then actually last week uh my friend Jason went to a conference and the CEO of uh Eli Lily I think it is the guy the maker of one of the semi glti or o epic competitors he announced that it has been officially approved for alcoholics uh so like I do put weird [ __ ] in my but body just to see what's up uh and I actually texted you 8 months ago I think and I said this new one I forget what I called it it was like trip it started with a t and I was like this one this is going to be the one what was that yeah I remember thinking I should buy Eli Lily stock when you told me that because uh I was like who makes this and I'm I'm in I learned my lesson the first time ignor like kind of writing off your weird Health experiments and I was like okay I'll just blindly follow this but Eli L is already a $750 billion company so I was like okay I don't know how much like upside is left on that like even if it became A2 trillion doll company it's like I like what am I what am I really thinking is going to happen here with this thing so you know I think I missed that but if you look at like a fiveyear span Eli Lily is up you know 10x almost in the fiveyear span so 8X do you do any health stuff today that you think doesn't it show thank you the sentence was not ending do you do any health stuffff do you do any health stuff today are you trying to die do you do any elal stuff today that you think is uh considered uh a freak and will one day be the norm yeah I do two things I don't think these are like in the freak I guess they are I guess if if I took a population of a thousand people and I said how many people are doing this I think the number would probably be zero even if I went to a CrossFit type of like Health Community thousand people and I said who's doing what I'm doing I think the number is zero you I think have done one of these things but there's basically two things I do on a daily basis and have been doing now for probably 2 years um the first is breath work every morning yeah that's awesome so I do breath work every morning it only takes me 6 to 10 minutes I use the other ship app uh it's the best breath work app I think you might have invested I invested it too but this is not a shill I don't even think the app is their product anymore like the app is like their side thing they have like physical locations in New York and stuff but their app is so good for breath work so I do that the second thing I do is I work out but I don't do what most people do when they workouts so you know I would say conventional workouts are either cardio or weightlifting and then some people will do like a yoga pilates something that's flexibility pliability based and my trainer got really into something and I'm into whatever he's into cuz he's my trainer for life and he got really into something called uh functional patterns a a style of training that I think the way to describe it would be like it helps you pick up a baby when you're old right where it's like yeah it's like so it's based around core movement so like like if you like sport this will make a lot of sense to you if you don't like sport if you're just used to going to the gym and trying to get a pump then this might not make a lot of sense to you but like if you play any sport baseball tennis basketball whatever it is like the core movement in all of the sports is like let's say throwing it's a it's a Twist motion of your body yeah it's not like a a squat or a bench press where it's a linear lift weight up it's uh yeah I understand love the pronunciation of linear there that was awesome that was that was like European like I also call it personal finance yeah exactly so the curers of this are all right so so yeah so if you go to a gym everything is usually static it's rigid or even if it's like a dynamic movement if very rarely involves like torque and if you do that wrong obviously you can get really hurt but doing it right matters so functional pattern is based around moving uh in like the four kind of core movements so so run or Sprint throw which is a twisting motion uh jump and then um I don't know I think it's just like walk like your gate and so like I literally like my workout when I go downstairs is not to like I go to my gym and it's not like some like berries boot camp music blasting like go go go push push push it'll literally be like all right let's practice our gate and it's like are you putting the right amount of weight on your big toe how's your weight shift let's look at your ankle Mobility here let's try to get strong in this position it's like things that don't even look like you're doing a workout it looks like you're rehabbing from an injury but it's an injury you never had it's like to prevent all your injuries and so like I do it my mom does it he trains like NBA players with this I it's it's that type of training where it's very much for sport and it's for yeah it's it's to prevent like disease and um like breakages in your body so it's a weird it's a weird style of training but that's something that I do you know four times a week basically mine mine are I think that in 15 years we're going to look at Whole Foods sort of like a discount grocer where it's like you know however you look at like Kroger Safeway wherever your Regional like Normie brand is that's what Whole Foods is going to be I think that uh people are going to be like they're going to think it's nonsense and they're going instead they're going to want to buy their meat locally so I think is that because it's marketing smoken mirrors or it's just not the top of the top either is there's no more levels above that which one is it is it that it's not what they say it is it's kind of like it's just a marketing stick or there's there's even better it's not what they say it is and also because they were the first popular health food store we still hold them with high Prestige but in reality I don't think they're that high Prestige I think maybe it's a lot more expensive than other Alternatives but I'm not convinced that it's actually significantly different than anything else what makes you say that because if you go and look at the ingredients of the hot food bar so if you go to the hot food bar and you look at the ingredients it's [ __ ] it's not good like they got all types of crap in the in those ingredients and that like to me is like a signal that's a canary and a coal mine type of vibe gotcha um and I also when you look at the meat so when you look at the meat so I tend to buy during the summertime I have a farmers market across the street from my house so I tend to buy my meat there and the chickens are like bright yellow have you ever seen like a like a like like a chicken from a farm that you get it's like no se eggs eggs look different but they look way different they look way different they look way different it's like a bright yellow honestly it's kind of gross if you're not used to seeing it uh and so all the foods have way more color in them and you go to Whole Foods and it it's kind of weird to think that uh a company as big as Amazon can somehow get lots and lots and lots of fresh healthy stuff isn't it [ __ ] insane how in Connecticut in December I can still get a strawberry like that's ridiculous when you think about that like supply chain and there's no way that you could do that in my opinion in some type of like Safe Way like it's better to do like local inseason type of thing and I think local meat in particular is going to be a a huge Trend in the next 15 years you're seeing it a little bit like there's a lot of people in Austin who I know that were like Yuppy types not like rednecks or farmers and they would buy whole cows and You' store it in your freezer and I think that will be more common soon do you agree or disagree I do agree with that cuz you're right when I think about the Freaks and Geeks in my life a lot of them already do that it's like they have a favorite Ranch yeah you get your meat and I was like the store what are you talking about like you know I don't have a I don't like have Farms on speed dial I don't have like a personal relationship with a ranch uh but they do and they have like they'll open up their freezer and there's all these like kind of like frozen steaks basically that they have yeah you like spend $1,000 and you get like a Year's worth of beef right so like I don't know and understand that uh I also so I don't know if this is true or this was just a one-off thing but like aren't farmers markets like I I've read something that farmers markets got in trouble because the they looked into where they were getting the stuff and it wasn't like from a farm it was like they were taking this the Safeway Rejects and like stuff that was about to expire and just selling it at the farmers market as like ooh like this is this is you know straight farm to table or whatever um so I don't know how much I trust like you know even my local farmers market that's the problem with all food yeah and I agree with that what do you trust you know yeah my sister one time went to Ghana for some trip and she came back with this souvenir that she bought from some kids on the street thinking they made it and it said made China on the back and so that's basically what like this little lady selling chicken uh at my Farmers Market might be doing so yeah that definitely could be a thing I think another thing is that in the future I think a lot of people are going to have plants in their homes way more than they do now I think plants are going to be a lot more popular because it keeps the air clean and I think one of the things in 20 30 years we're going to look back and be like you had dirty ass air in your house all the time that's probably why you felt sick all the time uh I think that um here's one natural fiber clothes that's going to make a a big comeback so there's one company called uh rer r y k r i don't know these guys I just think it's cool they make all cotton workout gear workout gear in particular often times you want like some type of sweat absorbing stretchy material typically that's not natural fibers and so a lot of people are wearing shorts and shirts and underwear that has plastic in it and has forever chemicals in it and I think that natural fiber clothing is going to be uh a lot more in fashion in the next 10 to 20 years because of what we're going to learn about forever chemicals and plastic and foods and then the last one is one use Plastics I think will make a decrease I think that it's weird how much bottle water we drink um and so those are some of my predictions but the the the cotton clothing I would bet a lot that that will be a very popular Trend in the next 20 years a health trend is there like a tradeoff like quality price what's the trade-off here yeah like look the reason why Lululemon is dope is because when you put on a Lululemon pair of shorts and it has that nice stretchy feel and when you stretch it it goes right back to how it's supposed to be that is uh man-made material so like it's good in that sense it's probably cheaper as well like natural fibers I think are probably more expensive and they like have you ever had a sweater that you wear a bunch and it starts lose shape like that doesn't happen with like a what I call a swishy material what's like the rain water resistant like material for like a range like that [ __ ] doesn't happen with that uh so that there is a trade-off is that like some of these man main stuff are definitely more convenient or are better performing that's why they call like like performance wear whatever performance wear yeah it's because it is like better performance right and so there is yeah there is a trade-off but I do think it's going to be more popular uh rker is actually the only company I found that is making somewhat interesting non-toxic workout gear but that's like an interesting uh it's an interesting angle for a company like that to get started in right right okay fascinating do we want to uh wrap it there I feel inspired to be a healthier better local local eating man machine dude local eating is great man it's great I got a I got a nice old Russian Lady he makes great cheese you need you need some cheese I got a lady it's fantastic kind of want to have a I kind of want to have a guy or a gal for every food that I eat it's like I have like a hummus lady I got a chicken guy that seems like my future to have that dude I'm down um all right that's it that's a pod [Music]

Josh Wolf has this phrase where he says chips on shoulders equals chips in Pockets basically is when you meet an entrepreneur who's got an uncurable unhealable you know identity wound um that ends up being somebody who ends up doing really [Music] well let me fill you in on some things that I saw this week that I just want to get your opinion on um Sam leson so Sam Lon uh I think he was like an early Facebook employee and now he's an investor uh he's he says a lot of interesting stuff so he did this tweet where he talked about uh Revenge businesses people who have started stuff because they want to get revenge and an example of this is this guy named Parker Conrad basically he started this company called zenitz which was fast growing company it kicked ass whatever he gets fired because it was like a broy culture there was like people caught like having sex in like the stairwells like people doing drunk dumb [ __ ] uh there was also like some compliancy issues of like not everyone was like compliant and so he got fired and so we started this new company called Rippling which has taken off like a rocket and uh Sam leson I guess invested in it same with Palmer lucky guy got fired from Facebook he started Oculus now starts uh what's it called andrel yeah Andel yeah uh and so anyway Sam leson has this really cool line he says if you have in your diligence checklist is this company a form of deep Revenge the answer is yes cut the check and and the reason I'm bringing this up is because often times you'll talk to someone and they'll say hey man you got a lot of hate in your heart you got to let that you got to let that out you can't you know you can't you can't hold that in your heart you can't like live with that I've taken the opposite approach for like the last handful of years I actually think that hate if you have in your heart it's can be really useful like revenge and rage is like a very useful feeling so is shame people will be like why are you guilting someone into like doing this or that I'm like well guilt is a wonderful emotion to improve uh and I wanted get your opinion on his uh take here I mean I think it's honestly kind of Genius um and I think people don't like to say things like this but there are a bunch of puristic for investing that sound so stupid or sound inappropriate but are actually true and useful so you know for example um and you and you can frame these different ways but um I have a friend who was like you know how Paul Graham talks about he wants to invest in Fierce nerds and a fierce nerd is basically it's a nerd who's like overly competitive and also like a little bit of a [ __ ] head yeah exactly you know doesn't uh is looking to sort of break the system beat the system is is overly competitive maybe uh unrefined in certain other areas of their life but that's what you want and my friend was like yeah I look for fierce nerds who love money he's like specifically the for love who for who love money is is a is a multiplier on the fierce nerd concept and you know We've joked on this pod before about like you know if in your pitch deck I'm like okay went on a Mormon Mission or like you know grew up in you know Slavic country Eastern Europe I'm like y you know little plus points are going off in my head these are green flags in my head it's not a for sure yes but like I'm not stupid like eventually you realize goddamn these people from Utah can sell or wow these programmers from this area of the country are pretty pretty badass or um when somebody is you know it's like getting a being a Harvard Dropout is a stronger signal than being a Harvard graduate there's all these things that sound silly but actually end up being true because if you're the type of person who can get into Harvard and then has enough conviction and an idea to drop out of Harvard against the social pressures of Harvard that actually turns out to be a pretty good filter now of course these things can be gamed if people realize that these are the signals you're looking for right like people showing up to pitch pitch meetings and like acting a little extra autistic it's like okay we kind of know what you're doing here you're trying to fit some pattern that this investor is trying to match against so all all these things could be game but the it's great when you can figure out a signal that is not yet common and so this one of is this person you know is this a Revenge company is a great signal it's a green flag signal have you seen the Ted Turner documentary that recently came out in HBO no everyone should go and watch this so Ted Turner has been one of my heroes for decades uh uh because uh his biography was so good and basically his story is that he inherited a billboard business from his father and it was a great billboard company like it was in the South and it was thriving he took the money from that and he started um a local TV station he eventually bought the Braves for cheap he bought the attic Hawks for cheap then he parlayed all of that Ed all of his money in CNN and was constantly on the brink of bankruptcy not because his businesses sucked but because he was just like pushing it 100% all the time and so there was this great line it said this is about one of his employees he goes Ted had a great sense paranoia within the company a sense that we were the little guys fighting for our lives against some big unknown guys and the truth is is that we were one of the biggest billboard companies in the South one of the biggest in the country but it made we wanted to make everything seem more important than it probably was and in fact uh he insisted on taking his telephone calls outside on payones because he wanted everyone to believe that his phone was being tapped and and if and if you watch his documentary he does all these amazing things like for example he's like I had to launch CNN because Americans at the time CNN was the first ever 24-hour News Network he was like we owe it to America like Americans need to have an option to know what's going on in the world like everything had this Grand sense of like we have to do this for America or like they're trying to crush us and it's like who's they we're we're the best and that was a big takeaway from Ted that I loved and uh this post kind of reminded me the same lesson posted by them there's a a couple other things that come to mind on this one um uh Travis colanic is kind of like this so he had um he had kind of gotten screwed in his first startup literally I think by Michael Ovitz um and others basically it was like during the lime wire well the background is Travis kalanick the founder of uber before Uber he started red swoosh which was some type of lime wire competitor a file sharing service yeah peer-to-peer file sharing service and he ends up not making a lot of money from it by the way Naval same thing he his naval's first hit nal's now like you know this wise Sage you know billionaire type of dude but he was kind of like an angry vengeful dude when he started epinions back in the day the VCS kicked him out of the company I think opinions ended up going public during the do com Boomer had like a kind of a big exit he got nothing he got screwed by his own VCS he didn't make anything from that no and he ends up suing them so he he does the thing normally in silica Valley the founders are very afraid to fight back against the VCS he publicly sues his own investors and ends up creating Venture hacks which is a um a Blog dedicated to helping Founders not get screwed by VCS he's like dude I didn't know how to read these term sheets and I didn't know what these contracts meant and they just kept telling me the the dangerous words oh don't worry it's all standard and he goes there's nothing more dangerous than something that that when when a lawyer or a VC tells you this is standard don't worry about it and he goes was standard ended up getting me screwed so he starts Venture hacks a Blog um and that leads to angelist which basically took the power away from in many ways the the uh VCS and gave it to Angel Investors the founders it created a Marketplace so you know it created more transparency more liquidity more more competition in that Marketplace and angelist becomes a multi-billion dollar company Elon is on a revenge tour right now literally the Democrats were attacking him or you know demonizing him Su you know doing uh suing Tesla and SpaceX and all of his companies and adding more and more regulation and so he just flips the script goes all in on Trump goes on a revenge tour now he's basically like a you know deao president um and he's now going now he's going in with Doge trying to like rip out the guts of the the the bureaucracy right like these these Revenge tours are really really strong Josh Wolf has this phrase where he says chips on shoulders equals chips in Pockets basically is when you meet an entrepreneur who's got a deep chip on the shoulder and a sort of a an uncurable unhealable uh you know identity wound um that ends up being somebody who ends up doing really well dude that's a 10 out of 10 phrase by the way chips and shoulders of chips and Pockets yeah that's a beautiful he he knocked that one out the park it's a good one and I've actually had trouble with this I used to go the other way we would meet somebody and they would say something that just sounded like oh dude there's a part of you that's broken inside are like you're really carrying this this revenge against somebody I used to try to a convince them that that's not they they shouldn't hold that or be like this person they're not like mature they're not wise to it and I immediately missed out on several big opportunities and again in that moment my reaction is to either a judge which is gets you nowhere or distance myself and say all right this person's not as they're not like-minded they're not seeing the world the way I'm seeing it and now what I've realized is no no no I need the exact opposite reaction you go really close to that person and you hand them a check and you say can I be a part of what you're doing I'd like for your crazy psychosis to be to my financial benefit and so like I'll give you example so I'm very close to this person and they have basically made something they um they had a bankruptcy back in their 20s late 20s I think so they were doing really well got to like a $25 million net worth but were overextended they're in the real estate game were a little bit overextended they they were doing development on behalf of this person who was expanding there there's like a guy who was expanding a bunch of locations so he's like cool you're going to do 15 locations great I'm in I'll go buy these and I'll develop them for you and then that guy got in trouble that guy went to jail so now he's holding the bag on these 15 locations that could only be used for one type of business all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our

so you're saying like it was like some guy let's say it's like a fast food franchise was like I'm going to be creating like 50 locations or whatever well you you go develop them and I and I'll meet you there they did deal one it was great deal two it was great and so he goes awesome you want to do 18 more of these boes great he goes and gets them permitted for this exact thing he does exactly what he's supposed to do on the real as a real estate developer but then that guy got in trouble for tax he hadn't been paying his taxes or whatever he he can no longer do this so now he's on the hook for like whatever 18 payments for a business he can't run and he can't use for any other purpose and he can't really sell it because it's distressed and it's and this happened right in O8 when the bank crisis happens and so nobody's investing in real estate anymore so he gets like basically series of events ends up going bankrupt well he uh has a traumatic experience and he goes bankrupt not only he goes bankrupt he was I think he was engaged or just gotten married and all of a sudden he's back in his childhood bedroom with his wife uh they've had to move back to his parents bedroom he's sort of ashamed of that and he had a $25 million net worth before that yeah and know buying like a million dollar engagement ring like that kind of thing and they turn off the lights to go to bed and he's like he's telling her he's like you know I promise you I will figure out a way like I don't care what the hell I have to do I will fight back I will figure out a way to make this right give me 9 months we're going to be here for nine months in this room and like whatever and he gives her this inspiring speech this Like Gladiator speech and then he turns off the lights like oh [ __ ] he had like the stars from like his you know there like sticker stars on the ceiling the neon ones and they start glowing and they just crack up laughing and he's like oh my God where am I and so and then he starts basically his revenge tour and he in the 10 years since then has built up like a billion real estate portfolio using only his own money no outside investors probably has you know I don't know something like four or five million of his own equity in these deals and has you know really come back strong and so I for years have been looking for a good way to invest in real estate like I looked at should I buy my own property should I have some rental properties I think I think I kind of should take this internet money that I'm making like I'm all in on the internet and I think I should take like you know 10 20% of it have it in like hard rock tangible assets you can go touch and feeli that seems like a smart thing to do but I never knew how should I do it myself uh I'm a beginner and that takes time and I don't want to go fix broken toilets should I give it to one of these funds or syndicators and then you would like meet them and you realize these guys are just fee monsters they they make all their money on the buy they don't make any you can good luck on the sale they make their money on the acquisition fees and uh management fees so I didn't like them and then when I met and then when this guy was like Hey you know like do you want to do a deal with me I was like I'm all in because the chip on this guy's shoulder of pro proving his dad wrong and like coming back from that bankruptcy and all of this like even though today he's super wealthy he'll never stop if you know if you're a grown man who knows what it feels like to sleep with your wife in a twin bed like you know that that sticks with you you know like the feeling of like exposed ankles of blankets that don't cover your ankles uh stays with you if you've ever had to call top bunk with your wife yeah you've experienced a trauma that I would like to invest in yeah when we were selling the milk Road I remember talking to I think I could say this uh I remember talking to some of the potential buyers and was like wow you've been really successful and I was like what and I try to get to the root what what was the motivation like why did you even go this path was it just you had an idea and or you had you wanted to solve this problem and I talked to two people and one was like no this girl rejected me in ninth grade and I just remember thinking like after that like I'm going to become somebody I'm G to be and he's like yeah I know it sounds stupid and like it was stupid but it was effective and the other one said the same thing he's like I I was trying to uh live in a house we had six friends and we were all like hey let's live together next year and then we found this awesome house but it was a five bed house and they were like hey man um it's only five beds he's like I realized I was in the bottom of my group and I was like f those guys like every night they're having fun in that house I going to be building an empire and I remember just thinking like really first of all that was like 20 years ago 15 years ago like that still bother like that still motivates you and they're and like don't you feel kind of silly that that that bothers you so much like you know and they were like no I feel they were Silly for ever counting me out and I was like wow okay I am not wired like these people I am not fueled by the same rage and like kind of Revenge instincts and I'm I'm not saying that's the only thing that motivated them but the fact that that was there still 15 years later was very surprising to me and I've now learned to bet on it uh I think that I'm not surprised that you've never had uh issues because you're I've said this a bunch of times you're very emotionally healthy dude I use rage and like guilt and um like I want to nicotine I want and nicotine no and I want to get back against someone like there's times that I remember my big brother like saying something smart alec to me and and I still feel that like oh I'm going to prove you wrong like I still feel it uh yeah that [ __ ] runs deep but it is pretty helpful uh it it it it makes you pretty miserable at life but it makes you like fairly productive uh I'm not gonna lie I'm kind of jealous about it like I I think on the whole is probably good I don't have that but does seem kind of badass when I hear it it takes like it's crazy what happens when so you know how I hate flying I had went through like 10 years of therapy to figure out why I don't like I'm so claustrophobic it comes down to when I was like uh in second grade my brother put me in a full nelson you know like a full nelson when like your big brother and he dipped me under under water in our pool and he was like you know like teasing me but I sucked in a little bit of water and I legitimately felt like I was drowning I distinctly remember like I'm dying right now I'm about to die and he kept dunking me and I was like you [ __ ] [ __ ] like I'm dying right now and like it's crazy how little moments like since then by the way I cannot stay on elevators I don't like taking Subways you'll swim you just don't like I fly swim I don't like anything where I'm constricted and I can't escape uh that that's it's rooted in like I can't escape so if it's like a boat that like you're going to go on and you can't see the shore it's like no I'm not do the hypnotist unlocked on you or you're saying you figured this out through therapy or something else therapy and hypnotherapy yeah like I've spent so much time and money to like figure out the root cause and how to overcome this uh all from like a a 60c interaction with my brother where he was a kid too he was being innocent and just messing with me isn't that crazy how like the things that happen as a kid can like impact everything by the way does it help when you figure out the W the cause or yeah like does it go away a little bit or no uh a little bit like I guess like uh there's this like idea of like uh getting over the stuff it's called like walking to the Gallow where like when you get panicky it feels like you're dying and in order to overcome that you just got to be like [ __ ] it I'm going to go die like I'm going to like experience this thing that I'm fearful of and uh and you just have to do it and it's like it's pretty it's pretty bad and like so you have to tell yourself all these stories to help get over it and one of them is like I only feel this way because John did this to me long ago and I was fine okay I was fine I will make it through this uh and so you got to like walk to the Gallow and you got to like tell yourself all these stories and so that's like one of the many coping mechanisms but it's just all happens because of a small thing when you're a kid so it could have been like some girl said this some guy said this to you right and it like it's crazy it just shapes like 50 years of your life dude what a sick phrase walk to the Gallow wow what a what is a Gallow even is that like that's where you get hung is it from a I think it's EI is that it's where you get hung it's like the Gallow is like the structure where where you're about to get hung and so like by the way I tried to break this the other day I went on the subway for the first time uh ever in New York uh I was like deathly afraid to go to the subway and I'm like we're just going to go one stop and I was like [ __ ] it we're walking to the Gallow there's also this isn't just for business this is also like you know Revenge body is a thing and remember that that Medium post we both love how to lose weight in four easy steps and it's like portion control um you know avoid beer and then it's like have your heart broken into not just broken shattered into into a million itsy bitsy pieces it talks about basically it's the Heartbreak that's like the the fuel for the gym like and in the same way that like you know if you want Adele to go triple platinum she just needs a bad heartbreak right it's it it fuels artists it fuels Fitness it fuels business and um I think it's sort of undeniable I don't know if it's healthy but it's definitely effective Taylor Swift wouldn't write hits if she had a successful wonderful relationship well we'll see Travis Kelsey she has she hasn't had any new hits yet she she you know she's she has hits for a reason all right what else you got um all right so something a little bit happier uh I saw this on 60 Minutes uh I think two weeks ago I cannot stop thinking about this so let me fill you the fill you in on this story so there's a small country called Bhutan Bhutan is in between India and China so it's it's between these uh behemi countries and because of that a lot of people don't know about it and it's tiny half the size of Indiana it's tiny I think their stock market is 18 companies and the total market cap of their stock market is $800 million which is 170,000 the size of the US Stock Market so it's like the super small country in fact I read that in 1999 that was the first year they got TV so it's like this tiny country well in the 70s the king of Bhutan did a diplomatic trip to India and uh according to the story this Indian Reporter Goes hey king um you know we're neighbors but I don't know anything about you like What's your deal what what are you about in fact what's your gross national product like like tell me what are you guys known for he goes gross national product what what are you talking about GDP what are you saying uh in Bhutan gross national happiness is more important than gross national product and it was this like off-handed comment that he made saying their biggest export is happiness we care about happiness and that totally hit it went viral everyone was like this little country is appar they must be the happiest place on earth and the King says that they care more about gross national happiness than money and the King was like oh people like really resonate with that let's make that our thing and so over the next 5 10 years they actually implement this and make this it's their thing and so in this country bhan to this day uh and every 5 years surveyors travel the country and they asked the people about uh education level salary and material possessions so like a lot of like normal stuff but then they also say like do you have negative thoughts do you have positive thoughts how much time do you spend working how much time do you spend praying and sleeping and the dec and the data that they get is factor in uh to a lot of their um a lot of the rules and things like that that they make and I thought it was like a great story uh about how you can care about things that aren't seemingly important like happiness and I had well you know what I mean like it's like you know we care about like money yeah the touch feel yeah and there is a few critiques which is like according to the world happiness report uh Bhutan is like average like it's like not kicking ass but but like you know I don't know if that's a m matter of like different ways of measuring things like that cuz happiness is like a way like it's kind of hard to measure happiness is it like that fleeting moment that you feel like the 30 seconds after you've eaten a good meal or is it like I feel contentment whatever but I thought it was cool for three reasons one the king just said some [ __ ] and it hit and he ran with it like been there bro I feel that becomes a thing right yeah it's like wearing a certain outfit in fourth grade and you're like I guess this is my identity my high sock guy yeah like I'm a the Chade wall is my guy like I'm a Chade wall guy like that's just my thing uh cuz a teacher said that the second thing is that um I do think it's like pretty fascinating that in a culture that you and I are part of and in America's particularly because we're such hard workers uh it's all about work work work but that's not really like the point of all this it's like to be happy so I thought it was cool that they're measuring that but another third and final uh thing that this makes this interesting have you ever heard of a pairing metric yeah basically like two metrics that let's say you have uh revenue on one side but you might have profitability on the other in order to make sure that like if you optimize on just Revenue you might totally nuke your profits or if it's about uh growth you want you know NPS score make sure your customers are happy is that what you mean yeah and so when Tim Ferris invested in the hustle we I got to hang out with him for an hour or so and I was telling him about how many subscribers we were growing by he's like well you need like a pairing metric you need uh you know not just Topline like subscribers email subscribers but like are they engaging are they opening whatever you have to have a par metric otherwise uh it kind of ruins the whole thing and and that was like kind of fascinating to me I I never heard that phrase and I didn't think about having a pairing metric with like government policy or you know like anything other than business and this is like a really great example of a pairing metric where it's about GDP traditional metrics but also you know make sure that your your people are are are happy along the way so I thought it was pretty cool yeah I I love this story I think I was telling you before this I think we both somehow the odds of us both having Bhutan on our list are so weirdly low I think maybe we both saw the same thing I saw the 60 Minutes thing a few weeks ago what did you think first of all it's so funny when you watch 60 Minutes 60 Minutes looks so old dude it looks and six minutes is basically just a YouTube channel it's great though right it's great but why does it looks so old like I like literally the person on there is old the clock they use for the 60 Minutes thing is so old all of the editing is so old they don't know like what like a jump cut is it's insane I think it's a a fun fact I'm almost positive it's the only TV show without a theme song it's literally just tick tick tick tick tick tick tick tick yeah exactly it's crazy so when you watch 6 minutes it's interesting to just look at it and be like what is this dude anyways here's a couple of the things that stood out to me about this so first why do I why am I interested in a country I'm interested in a country because in the same way I'm interested in companies that are run in interesting ways or if a company had a unique Mission or business model or a unique way of doing things that'd be interesting to me countries are just big companies and I found this pretty interesting if you looked at it like a company where it was like oh what what's our main metric it's not Revenue it's happiness so it's like instead of the gmv they're looking at at how much happiness they're producing in their own economy and I like that they measure their own and like did you look at their their happiness index kind of zero to one and how that all works yeah it's like a weighted score right what what in what we all the metrics or it's basically it's a way to score then they they sort of um they ask people a bunch of questions about their uh you know psychological well-being their health their time you know their education all these different things and they end up with like you know basically they're a 7 point a 781 on their scale which is pretty good and they measure oh that's up 3.3% since last year and basically 9 and a half% of B's people are deeply happy 38% are extensively happy 45% are narrowly happy and 6.4% were unhappy according to them and um and they're what I thought was cool was that a couple of things number one it's a one of the very few cases where someone in power gives it up so they had a king and he voluntarily is like you know what this could just go to my son but we need a democracy and and the funny thing is the people there were like no no King stay King he's like no no no we need a democracy they're like democracy you see India's a democracy Pakistan's a democracy look at those places they're always at War it's violent forget democracy we don't want it we're happy and he was like well if I just keep giving this you know power down by birth this won't end well so I thought seeing somebody relinquish power in their crime is so rare yeah that you just Overlook it when you on the surface but if you actually think about that deeply that actually is like a really Noble and very cool and very unique thing how few know Biden didn't want to give up power and Trump doesn't want to give up power nobody wants to give up power power is one of the most addictive things in the world and so I just thought that was really Noble and really cool of him um to voluntarily go to democracy at a time of Peace which is which is not usually what happens usually if a democracy happens it's after a time of violence or War people need change or the Western Country comes in and helps and tries to force a democracy on them so I thought that was cool did they say that was the only time that's ever happened that way it's the only one I know of yeah they kind of referenced that that's that's never really happened before that a democracy happened in a time of Peace voluntarily also crazy that just like you know until 19 until the 70s like in 1974 there's people listen to this podcast that are born before 1974 they didn't have a currency it was barter even up until 1974 that's crazy and the crazy thing was even though there was barter they still had to pay taxes and it was like you could pay your tax with like giving them giving the government like a cow or if like oh you don't have livestock all right uh do labor then and so then they built these amazing buildings because your taxes was basically community service it's like hey I'll go donate like you know 100 hours of Labor to pay my tax for the year and then because of that they built these really cool buildings side weird note that you know our friend she friend of the Pod she uh I think he posted this thread it's a thread of him going there he like meets the king cuz he's like it sounds crazy to meet the king but like he's like I was at a bar and I was talking to this guy and that guy was the former like whatever he was the former like prime minister or whatever he's like now he's a surgeon and he's just drinking at this bar and he's like oh you want to meet the king yeah I can introduce you and so he meets the king and so he's like going he's talking about his experience there one of the crazy things he points out is like a lot of the buildings penises painted on them in like Artful ways so you know it's a little bit of super bad mixed in there I like that the other crazy thing is the Bitcoin stuff did you see their Bitcoin stuff I know they have uh the they they own more Bitcoin than the total market value of their stock stock market it's like a billion dollars in in in Bitcoin yeah they basically have made themselves wealthy for life they used their like their vast nature so like you know they use hydroelectric mining to mine Bitcoin and it's it's believed that they have a billion dollarss of Bitcoin but that was uh like I think that was reported like uh you know 8 months ago so I as as as if they have double that now you know what I mean like it's been they've had a great run the US has it because they seized the Silk Road right so they have you know the the the US has 20 billion China has 20 billion UK has 6 billion El Salvador which has been buying and holding Bitcoin um has and and and and the guy on that 60-minute show he did a great job of saying he's like we're human we still want to be rich and we want stuff and we want all this other stuff we also want to be happy and so because people were like well so if you're just about happiness why are you buying Bitcoin and all this he like well I I still want nice [ __ ] yeah yeah more prosperous we are the happier we'll be the other thing that I thought was cool you know they do free education free healthare all that good stuff uh but they also were like hey 60% of the land is going to be like dedicated to Nature and but there's no I think they don't allow mountain climbing they like have these amazing mountains cuz they're in the Himalayas yeah but you're not allowed and he said this great line he goes he goes uh nature is he goes nature is not meant to be conquered he's like man has this thirst to just conquer everything oh there's a mountain I got to climb it and put my flag on top and they just had a different attitude it's like nature is beautiful it's meant to be enjoyed meant to be it's sacred it's meant to be sort of revered and not conquered and I just thought man these people roll to a different a different beat and I respect it I'm glad that these little experiments live I had the exact same feeling which is I saw him talk and and they sort of fit a lot of the stereotypes that you would have with like a Nepal uh the do Lama like this like wise cuz and I think they're like uh they have like a national outfit or something like that and it looks like The Bu and they are Buddhists but it looks like that uh like whatever the dolly llama uh like the shaw or whatever he wears so they jeans yeah we love job yeah yeah the national sport is grinding uh they had this like Cool vibe of like wisdom and [ __ ] and it was very shocking to see that because I'm like watching this on a Sunday night as I'm gearing up to talk about money and gearing up to to get after and crush the week and then I see this guy who was like uh talk about happiness and [ __ ] and I was like this is incredibly refreshing it was pretty cool it it seems like a great country I think by the way there's all these like other downsides I think she even said he was like it's pain in the ass to get there like I don't even think they have an international air like the roads are not very developed like there's you know there's there's there's other thing when you prioritize happiness above all maybe your Ro maybe your roads kind of suck yeah so like it was pretty sick dude I I thought it was great I was very inspired so I wanted to bring up Bhutan well there is one other piece to it which I I guess a bunch of young people are leaving the country um did you you see that part I I didn't fully follow that but they they were then going to build a new city in Bhutan the mindfulness City and it was going to be like they they launched a 100100 million Bond and then they're basically trying to make it a city where it's like walking and cycling and green spaces for meditation and mindfulness based education and ecotourism like all the [ __ ] bology talks about with like a network state or like the practice guys are trying to do these gu you know Bhutan is building a new city with like a its own cultural values trying to use that to attract people to the country well you want to hear a funny story is um biy is and a lot of these crypto guys are in on this new thing called American classus it's that uh monument that they're proposing that they build in the Bay Area I don't know if it's it will never get built very likely but the same architect who's on board with that is doing their is that was the guy in the 60 Minutes episode he's the guy who's building bhutan's new city and so there is this like weird um crossover of the crypto guys and these people who are like let's what's the what would a new city look like and bhan yeah it's pretty inspiring honestly it makes you think bigger right it makes you think about things you just take for granted they just seem set in stone they seem like they were just they were already here they'll always be here it always was this way it'll always be this way and then you hear about somebody you know these people who who are trying to like shake that and you realize oh wow it's all the whole world is more malleable than you thought yeah and they also were approaching it in an interesting way with their new city I forget the quotes but he said something about how he's like we know that this is like a 50-year project like we're going to go slow because we don't want to hurt the environment and it was and the guy was like but you're going to be dead when they like do that and he was like isn't that awesome that something will like outlive me like they had a very so if you're if you're listening to this uh it's on YouTube for free so Google Bhutan 60 Minutes it was an awesome segment all right now that we talked about Bhutan and happiness and how there's more to life than money can I tell you about one of the most ruthless capitalist bloodthirsty moves that I've seen uh in a while you know how they in boxing they say steal around cuz like in the last 10 seconds that's what judges remember they don't remember the first 100 they don't remember the first 120 seconds but they remember the last 10 seconds whatever you whatever you say last is what I'm going to be most inspired by so let's we skipped sit down baton you had your moment yeah now tell me how I can go cut some [ __ ] all right this is a private Equity rollup in the education space that I I found pretty interesting all right what is what does that mean so I went to high school in Texas for the first two years and then my mom and dad came to me one day and they were like hey check this out doesn't this look like a cool house I'm like yeah it looks pretty cool and they're like we're going to live there and I was like okay we're and they're like it's in Beijing and then my family moved me to Beijing in 10th Grade and so they went too yeah yeah was just me that would have been super cool they moved me there and them they moved themselves oh they so they were like hey you know all those friends you've had like you're not going to see them anymore and so um they also lied to me and said my dog couldn't come and and told me that China doesn't allow dogs and later life found out that was a huge lie um so you know that's maybe that'll be my revenge tour dude that's it that's the thing wait so did they leave the dog yeah we sold our dog cuz oh dogs can't C to China I was like what oh my God stupid there's no Google at the time they got to this is preg Google so um so I'm I finished high school in China and I went to this school called The International School B it was actually an awesome school and it turned out to be great for me to move and all these awesome things happen to me there but as one of these things again I just I go to the school I just take it for granted there's a school here I don't know schools are part of the government they're just like from the land I don't know God put it here I don't know what puts these international schools here and now I'm like in my 30s and I'm reading up and I realize oh [ __ ] these international schools are an absolute Juggernaut of a business and so um I'd like to tell you about this rollup that happened called uh Nord Ang have you ever heard of this yeah uh my friend Anan from CB insights uh is obsessed with it and so here's what these guys did so the the founding story is back in the 70s you know things like 50 years old there was one school in the UK or there wasn't even a school it was like making materials for other schools to teach English as a foreign language to people who are trying to learn English in the UK and then they expand that into Eastern Europe whatever and then they start their own school they're like oh we'll do our own school for teaching International people and we'll teach them in a in a sort of English Second Language kind of way and over time the thing grows and it goes from one school to multiple schools and they create this like business that eventually becomes a 14 billion doll conglomerate of 80 plus International private schools can you say the name one more time Nord Anglia n o r d and then anglia's a n g l a so what do they do uh and by the way remember remember when IMG sold IMG which is like the sports Prep Academy and it sold for a billion dollars we're like wow not Anglia bought it so this bought IMG and the reason they bought IMG they're like IMG is a really cool sports focused brand but it's all in the US we are we know how to basically create international schools that the richest wealthiest or xats living overseas want their kids to go to um to be able to get into you know maybe us us uh colleges so they bought it for a billion dollars being like cool we're just going to take the IMG brand and we're going to pop it up in China and India and in all these different countries in order to to to get those types of students who are sports focused whereas their schools are more you know teaching the the the the IB curriculum which is like the the kind of international baloria the the equivalent of AP in the United States is IB so like I took the IB Program um and so and but the cool thing about this business is actually for the first 10 years it was just a slow burn and these businesses fascinate me like I don't even really fully understand how you can go from you kind of like a a consultant selling teaching materials at one point they had a daycare like a nursery built in it was like just this slow sleepy business for like 10 years was it like a family run thing yeah it was like privately owned and then they hired the CEO and then they start expand they start their own schools they start expanding then they start buying other school FR school like chain so they bought like a six School chain um that that had like a presence in let's say France and then they buy another one that has a presence in Latin America and they're just rolling up as many international schools as they can buy they buy five schools in India for $200 million um and so now they got five five international schools in India and um basically this company ended up going public a um it and then had a take private offer and now is valued at 14 billion which is pretty pretty wild and there's one PE firm this Swedish private equity firm that has just made an absolute killing it's called eqt on this entire like 20year run of this business um so you know let's say 0 here's the timeline 1970s it's teacher training language programs 1990s so now this is like you know 20 years into the business they pivot to owning and operating their own international schools 2008 now another 18 years goes by the Swedish PE firm comes in gives them a bunch of money to rapidly go expand and acquire schools 2014 they go public 2017 they go private again for 4 billion 2024 it's acquired $4.5 billion and um 2008 when they did the uh the private Equity round they were at 40 million in iida and you know about 200 million in revenue and so these things trade at like 8 and a2x uh IA basically and they only own like 10% of the International School Market still 90% of the International School Market is fragmented and and not owned by by anybody well now they do a billion in Revenue it said yeah now they do a billion in Revenue with you know hundreds of millions in EA and and actually it's I think it's even I think it it might even be even more than that but like just to give you an example here's a slide but like this is like one of their schools so they show like the profitability of a school this is one of their case studies so it's like Dubai they open an international school in Dubai they opened it in 2014 it took $7.5 million to build it and open it and then basically they break even in year uh year 2/ year three and then it's basically making 55% net you know cash on cash once it's at that mature level once they get the enrollment up to like 1400 1500 students and so you could see like the enrollment basically by year three they're at almost, 1400 students so almost at capacity how do they convince parents that they're worth it cuz like uh with school it's tradition usually is what like uh you know gets people to buy in um yeah so it's kind of the same thing so if you go look at their pitch it's basically that um you know we have we have the best run schools our kids get into top tier colleges and you know uh x per of them gra you know huge like 90 something percent of them graduate they do better than their peers on um you know the the standardized testing things like that it's basically like when Chick-fil-A started expanding to New York and all the New Yorkers were like finally you know what I mean like people like know this know this brand in Beijing the school I went to right like we probably had like 100% graduation rate like there's like no dropouts everybody graduates and then like 98% went to college so there like it's like compared to like a normal school the whole school I was going to in Houston before that probably was like 75% graduation and less than 50% would would enroll in college the next year and so and then the school I went to you know that's a that's like a first grade through 12th grade school and every year you're basically paying college tuition it was like 40 Grand a year to go there as a first grader and as a second grader and as a third grader as a fourth grader like the way my parents afforded to go there was the same way that many students did which is when companies bring you overseas cuz you know let's say you know my dad worked for a company they wanted him to relocate to like build up their business in China then the company basically pays for your kids education as part of the relocation package and that's like a really good perk that's the perk it's oh you know and so these schools basically it's kind of like us schools how they make their money is because the government will give like student loans to anybody like anybody can get a student loan so you get like you know $200,000 a day to go to the school whether you're going to be able to pay that off or not doesn't matter so the schools are like great that's why tuitions keep going up because they're like awesome the government will just keep paying for this this is amazing international schools work largely the same way which is it's either very wealthy people there who want their kids to go abroad like if you're very wealthy in Indonesia or China or India you want your kids to study in the United States and you're probably you know like very very rich and so you're you're happy to pay you know 40K a year for like elite elite education or the companies are paying for it so a beautiful business model where you're only catering to that top kind of 1% and and interestingly I think that there's actually a Blue Zone in America because when you think of a for-profit university I think of University of Phoenix yeah I I think bad I think they're the ones who let everyone in uh and they just buy all the Facebook ads and Google ads and it's slimy but for some reason when I look at these schools I think Prestige I think uh like like it can be done well do you know what I mean you know the one I want to do or like I've been very like tempted to do is the modern-day film school so like film schools exist in the states and that you know you can go to USC or UCLA these are like the famous ones that you can go to but like media and content has changed dramatically from when those schools were founded right and credentials are less important I would think and credentials are way less important and back then you know let's say you were a student in the ' 80s and you wanted to work and film someday well when you were in school you really had no shot you could go be an intern somewhere maybe hold up you know you're holding the lamp you know in the the back and you're holding the light and that's like all you would be qualified to do today let's say you want to be good at creating films or content or music or whatever you could literally be publishing on YouTube on Tik Tok on Instagram on Spotify you can be publishing everywhere and actually like you could be in the market you can be a the day you have the idea to do it you could be published that night that you could be 14 years old and be you could be the best in the world at doing twitch streams or whatever it is right like and so what and and the number one dream of young kids is to be a content creator it's the number one aspirational profession which you could judge and say that's stupid or whatever you want the dream is the dream that means there's a lot of demand for people who want to learn this why don't I go to Mr Beast why don't I go to Jimmy and say hey why don't you create with your brand a university that is the modern day like content creation skill stack so it's all the things you need to know right videography photography script writing um editing sound production you know music production all all the creative arts basically but do them in a way where it's like a two-year program it's like a like a business school so it's two years and it's all Project based so you go there and you have access to all the equipment which you normally can't afford as a young person like the best cameras the best recording studios the best editors terminals all that stuff um animators and then there's people who have different disciplines one guy wants to be an anim one guy wants to be an editor the other person wants to be a talent whatever it is and you work together on projects you create content you actually put it out on the networks and you get judged based on the number of projects you create the quality of the projects you create you're getting real feedback along the way and then you have mentors or teachers like a Mr Beast or like others who are going to like drop in and basically teach you some of the fundamentals of maybe storytelling or different things that actually you need to do and I think you if you did this I mean just the math of this stuff is pretty crazy right like you get 5,000 or 10,000 people coming to your school and it's you know 25k a year for two years that that's that one batch of kids 10,000 people in a in a in a class if they're paying 25k a year um for two years that's 500 million in Revenue What stopped you from doing this you seem pretty hyped up on it and it seems like a very logical thing um well I had the idea like four days ago so you know that's probably you've been talking about uh specifically the media thing like I've always been interested like what would you do if you did a new school I always thought of it in terms of Entrepreneurship but I actually think a more like trade school style school is better for sure for sure because you can only you know teaching entrepreneurship is hard because a there's not not a class for business really business school doesn't teach you business it teaches you management like what you think of as Harvard Business School is actually a you know middle management to Senior Management training program right that's what that is um so I think a TR when you actually learn Le a skill and learn a trade that's good the skill of business takes a lot of time and it's not one skill it's like 15 it's a bundle of like 15 skills you got to know a little bit about strategy and negotiation and marketing and building and managing and all these things so I think this trade school style is much better there's an interesting example of this by the way do you know what full sale University is yes so I'm looking up IT Tech but I'm also looking at full sale I know a few people that went to full sale and they had great things to say yeah so full sale is kind of at it's at that scale so so 25,000 undergrads it's $26,000 a year it's a private for-profit college so you just do the math by the way 25,000 undergrads 26,000 a year so that's that's like the annual revenue let's let's do some public math because big numbers are an exception that's $ 600 million $650 million a year uh of Revenue that they're generating from like a four-year cohort um my friend Chris uh have you heard of the company lenoe yeah yeah he boot and sold it for I don't know like $800 million he's he's from Nashville and I knew him when I was younger and he went to full sale and he and he's uh that's kind of how I learned about full sale but they have like if you look at you know Jason catron the founder of Discord he's one of the alums yeah and so I think they do more than just uh like I knew it as that's where you'd go to get like a uh like a if you want to become a music record engineer yeah so it was like game design was one that's why Jason went there because he wanted to build video games they have music and then they have The Dan Patrick School of sport uh sports broadcasting a TV broadcaster they had their own little program a degree a sports cter degree program just but how does it work since it's a not a normal it's a for-profit university does Dan Patrick actually get paid to use his name or can didn't donate a licensing a royalty CRA that's great that's what I'm saying for like if you're if you're Jimmy or Mr Beast like why are you selling chocolate like we should do this and we just need to find like an operator and do it with a physical campus and like do the whole thing right make the whole thing happen and there's like an enormous Talent economy that needs to be made not just for people who themselves want to be a famous YouTuber but every single company has to create content content is marketing and so any company that needs you go look at every every corporation from you know like Nestle down to your you know nearby eyebrow waxing place they're all got an Instagram they all got a Tik Tok they're all posting content on there and so every company needs media creation talents and nobody teaches you that it's today it's something you learn on your own outside of school using your own social media as a testing ground and I think that's a little bit crazy given the value of this thing and so I think you know it's the type of thing that could be built and be a you know multi-billion Dollar business within three or four years M easily you know getting 5,000 or 10,000 people to to enroll is not hard for for something like this because it has tangible value too like when you walk out not only will you have these hard skills on you know actual content creation all the the bucket of content creation skills but like you're highly employable so whether you become a Creator or you're or you go get a job like you're highly employable with a a set of skills especially if you make it Elite like don't make it University of Phoenix make it more like Harvard where it's like oh where do the talented people go right what's it like juliard it's like make it more like juliard where this is where the most talented people go and build that reputation I think that's the key to get this right this is an incredibly compelling pitch um I want to know what the downsides are uh which I don't even know if you know at the moment because uh you're 72 hours into this career transition accreditation can matter so if you want accreditation you can do that um does that matter does accreditation matter I guess it I guess it does for Optics right uh no it matters for for uh uh funding so so how do you get funding from the government how do your students get loans if you're an unaccredited school students can't get loans they got to pay for it out of pocket and and so you want accreditation so that you're eligible for loans which would let students go there you know who don't already have the money plus you know it's much easier to spend money the government gives you when you're 20 18 20 years old um so you know you want to be eligible for that but you can you can get accredited or you can buy a school with existing accreditation so that's not a blocker it's just like a thing you got to do um the hard part is actually running it and like doing it well and like actually providing quality education right you don't want to be University of Phoenix so you got to have some soul you got to have some some energy you got to have the entrepreneur energy why so why am I not personally doing this because I personally am not going to be the guy running this I want to kind of make it happen and find an operator who wants to create something like this and I can connect all the dots of how do we get the capital because this takes a lot of capital you know like Joe Londale started a school in Austin I don't know how much he how much that cost but I think it's like a I wouldn't be surprised if that's like a 50 million to100 million project of like what it called University of university of Austin Austin University that's crazy uh I mean yeah that's pretty wild and if you look at like uh so billionaires have put 200 million into funding that uh that's coool so yeah you know it's it's a big capex lift um to to do it when you have a physical campus and I wouldn't do it remote I would do it legit I would do it with a physical campus and I would just try to make it like awesome and it's same thing like we talked about the Baton thing it's a 50-year play like you want to build Prestige and Legacy like a Harvard or a Stanford where it's the reputation the reputation and the brand is the value you want the best people to pay top dollar to come to this thing and get the best education then you want all the companies who want to hire to Value the label that you have so to do that you have to assume you're going to be you you want to do something that Peaks you know like 50 years later um in terms of brand Prestige yeah that's like an interesting thing by the way so um there's like been a lot of times where uh people will sign up to for a university and the goal is that after 10 or 15 years the brand name has elevated so you bought the price before it was full you know it's just like investing in a stock and then there's other times when a a university will 30 under 30 yeah where a a university will have a protest or something will happen and it hurts the brand and you're like for example uh let's say you graduated from Columbia you're like [ __ ] like it's a controversial place right now is my I bought this brand is that now worth less than what I was anticipating and so there's this weird that that is like an interesting way to look at uh building a university brand of like I have to increase the value for you know so I can I can justify that the people buying they actually bought it when it was cheaper as opposed to what it is worth in 20 years dude did you see Bill Amman did a presentation about Harvard did you did you see this no what' he say oh my God all right I know we're supposed to wrap up but this is honestly incredible Jim Grant asked me to give a talk on Harvard buy sell or hold in the same way you would do with the stock I think the the Harvard Motto or slogan is Veritas and the title is Veritas question mark because you know he's on his like anti- Harvard Crusade right now what's veritos mean forever truth I think truth and so he breaks it down like it's a company you know the business of Hard College is private education to students and then it has like a graph it's like enrollment has been flat over the last 20 years faculty growth has been modest you know growing at half a per but Administration growth has grown by 40% in 20 years so he's like basically like oh you're not growing students but you're growing your admin your Opex on the back end right and analyzing it like a business this is amazing and the cost has grown basically the cost has doubled in say he says you're growing by increasing prices not by increasing the number of customers served exactly and then it talk and so he breaks down the p&l he breaks down where's the revenue Stream So how much is coming from donations versus tuition um how much of your faculty has diverse viewpoints I mean really obviously his agenda in this whole thing was to basically be like Harvard has gone too woke and the Administration has gone like Rogue and you're you're ruining the the brand in the mission of Harvard he say the operating margin would be a negative 40% without distributions from its endowment yeah and it says in 1643 that's how old Harvard is in 1643 Harvard's first mission was set up simply as Veritas or truth and he's got this old screenshot of like a handdrawn logo of the shield and then he reads like the the the laws Liberties and Orders of Harvard College and like this handwritten document um about you know the the goal was to encourage Harvard students to seek wisdom and he's basically saying like you know then then he shows how the mission Charter has changed so in 20120 it was instead of about seeking truth it was like it removed a bunch of references to the 1650 Charter and basically left it as more of like a Dei style Mission yeah and he's like you know paying attention to that so you know he's like what you know what happened to new ideas what happened to the truth and then he goes and and he just breaks down like fac also like even in the faculty growth he's like cool is it growth in Compu Compu science teachers or is it growth in African-American studies um which you know he basically shows that African studies grew like crazy compared to economics or computer science um but then he's looking at the number of degrees that people are getting and that's not growing so he's like you're not Mee your supply is not meeting the demand of the consumer you're just your supply is growing arbitrarily not not to match not to match demand like I think there was only uh what was it like there was one degree recipient in 2023 in African American studies and 57 faculty this is wild and do you know and and here I if you go down all the way to the last slide his verdict he says is Harvard a buy sell or hold and his verdict as of now is Harvard is a hold it still has many positive attributes it has a strong brand 400e operating history $51 billion endowment and huge real estate uh but it has many challenges the quality of the education has deteriorated there's so many competitors many talented people aren't going to traditional universities they've misallocated resources and the endowment has been a chronic underperformer this is a very interesting way to look at many many many different decisions in life that are Beyond just money how awesome is this this is the greatest this is this is a fantastic way to think yeah this is so cool is this all decisions I think I should every big decision I have in life I I need to put together a PowerPoint like this we did this with our child's name by the way we put three names in a PowerPoint and like Sarah presented them and like argued like in her favor which name we were going to choose hold on hold on what what is that what is even in the slide what do you say like so the way that we make decisions in our house often times it's uh like one person will present three options and then the other person can select the one option that they want and so if it's like uh Factory Chipotle or froz dinner so it's like uh if I'm selecting the three I will select three that I'm at least okay with and then she could select the one that is of most interest to her for baby names it was like uh she was like you uh I want to select a three and then you could select the one and so she made a PowerPoint and it explained here's the three names here's the background of the name and I had like um parameters I was like I want something somewhat traditional I prefer it be in the Bible because everyone in my family was named for someone in the Bible whatever and she's like all right here's the three uh that I like I'm cool with all of them here's the background of each name uh here's what it means here's famous people named that here's uh where it ranks on the popularity list here's trying to persuade you towards one or it's a completely neutral like pros and cons of each in that case it was neutral but yeah often times there there is an underlying persuasion bit but the if you're the person who selects the three you should select three things that you're you like uh you should CU that's like what you could do is you can select three things that that you like then I as the final decision maker will select something and you're happy no matter what it's a great way to make decisions I think and so she did this big presentation on three different names and I selected the winner uh and that's how we got our baby's name last podcast you said every month we sit down at the end of the month at our table and we review the month's budget financial decisions key financial decisions that were made we discuss unresolved issues that might be lingering I'm kind of into the par Corporation par Corp is is uh probably one of my favorite corporations to learn from and I think the way you run your marriage like a Business Partnership is both effective and hilarious we did great combo before we got married we did that by the way we said uh you know this is going great like we really love each other we like each other I it it appears as though like marriage is in the cards you know we said this like six months into dating uh write down where do you want to be in 10 years like what do you want to do like let's how do you want to raise a family where do you want to live and we like made sure that like our once in our interest like we're like all right like we disagree here but like that's okay I'm valuable there but here's like a deal breaker what do you feel about that so for hers it was like I want to raise children in the New York area so I can be around my family that's a deal breaker and I was like no that's cool I could I could I could [ __ ] with that uh and so yeah we do this type of stuff it feels cold I don't even like talking about it cuz people think because like it feels cold uh but dude this [ __ ] works these type of like discussions where it's like all right now's the period to discuss this you have the floor that stuff is so effective I think yeah yeah it's great before you guys go to bed you just shake hands instead of Kiss it's just nice like to to just keep everything you know on the up and up and uh as calculated as canete that's why I hate talking about it because people think that everything's like systematic it's like no like there's like two hours a month where like there set aside to like have these like relatively formal discussions but it's freaking awesome I think that I I think if you uh like have a lot of kids don't people do like family meetings I know I saw it in like TV shows growing up but it's not a thing uh yeah I think family media are a thing I think you guys just really uh take it to that next level you guys are the Mackenzie of family meetings right like vows. PDF before your wedding you had it all set up it's good I like it it works I suggest everyone at least try it it definitely works I think um all right I think that's uh I think that's a killer episode to be honest I feel hyped up I I have energy honest with a with a heart H that was a great episode all right that's it that's the pot [Music]

all right it's the end of the year and forget New Year's resolutions we have something much better so in the next hour Jesse ller is coming on and he has a entire process for planning a monster 2025 I don't want to play catchup I want to attack like now I'm taking control and I'm dominating the year not other people taking it away from me Jesse is a incredibly successful guy he started ziko coconut water he started a private jet company he sold to Warren Buffett he's an Emmy award-winning rapper got four kids he's an ultramarathon or he lived with David goggin if you don't want to learn from this guy something's wrong with you you're broken inside if everybody does the three things that we're going to talk about in 2025 and does everything else the same at the end of the year if they see me in an airport they're going to bear hug I saw Sean writing like I like take notes these are my golden nuggets from this episode These are you know my pen dive halfway through and now you added 20 winning habits you're Jason borne you're decent board Jesse is amazing he tells us this process that he's been doing for the past 25 30 years I'm pretty pumped about it and I think you will be [Music] too I'm glad to be back man I love your show I love that you got me back as a repeat as a repeat offender so let me just start by saying that you know I love December I think December and January is are critical months for the 11 or 12 months that follow them and as we head into the new year you know the first thing that I do like any business in America when we get to the end of the year they close out the year they have review sessions what worked what didn't work you know what was successful what wasn't successful they give thems a grade Etc and I found that um a lot of people don't do that in their own personal life so I like to take a little inventory in December and just kind of have a little review process around how the year went and and and take inventory on my own personal year but like no one taught me how to set up my life you know like no one taught me how to like deal with my emails and no one taught me how to schedule properly I never like I didn't take a class in school that like hey you're gonna have four kids you're gonna get bombarded with emails from from the school with all kinds of appointments and zoom calls that we didn't have back then and you know your calendar is going to fill up with other people's requests for your time like how do you want to deal with that so you have enough time to do things that you want to do and achieve the goals that you want to do within work and outside of work no one taught me that and then layer in children and layer in a wife that works in a business as an entrepreneur and like how do you do that so you know like I'm a product of trial and era I tried a lot of stuff I didn't grow up with a phone I was scheduling everything on a paper calendar for literally 45 years of my life um you know and um and I had a figure out like what as my life ebol how to grow with it so I have a pretty cool system I'm happy to share it with you guys it's worked really well it's allowed me to to balance a lot of things and get a lot of things done and I think it's pretty simple and I will preface it by saying that um you know as you get older how old are you guys 35 and 36 right yeah six all right so you got another maybe decade before this hits but it will hit and it's inevitable as you get older creating newness becomes really hard because you live in routine you know and like it gets very comfortable to be to live in routine and really I found that the only way to really guarantee that you create newness and newness is important it's important to relationships it's important to your momentum and your enthusiasm and your success and your excitement towards thing and your growth the only way to create newness I found is the planet and or leave room to be spontaneous so I become a really aggressive planner and I feel like a lot of us played um life on defense our calendars fill up with other people's requests for time like I mentioned Zoom calls weddings appointments school stuff and at the end of the year like you don't have a lot to show for it what are the categories I do Family Fitness Finance fun do you have like your own like cute acronym uh for your categories well I do my own individual personal audits for business with my teams but then from my personal thing Adventure is a category for me I try to look through like what kind of Adventures did I have like I said and we'll get into this in a minute you know you want to have something to show for all your hard work at the end of the year not your Zoom calls I'm not like yes in October I lit it up on Zoom I'm not doing that I'm like oh just I just took a one-on-one trip with my daughter to New York City I just got back so stuff like that I'm like really taking inventory on how much time did I spend with my kids you know what did I do well what I do what I have to work on in my like I really really do do that and then I try to close out the year and I have a system for closing out the year I'll share it with you guys really quickly and like the overall theme of closing out a year and I think everyone should take a couple hours to do this I think it builds momentum and I think it gives you a little closure around the year whether you had a great year or a bad year it gives you a fresh start for 2025 which I think is is really really important and um the theme is I want to come into the new year light I want to feel light and I want to get rid of all the email baggage all the to-do list all this I don't want to have a lot of carryover going into the new year I want to kind of clean my hands and just be light now this might sound ridiculous it starts in my closet I go through my closet I look at all the stuff that's been hanging there for 12 months that I've never worn you know and I donate it I get a big bag if if anything is a 5050 do I want to keep it or don't want to keep it I just say someone needs this more than me it goes in the Donate box and I start to organize my closet so when I walk in I don't have a ton of decisions you might see me wearing very a shirts very similar to this because I don't have a lot of options you know I keep what I like I get rid of what I don't like and I get super clean my desk I get rid of all the Clutter on my desk I want I don't want to walk in and I got stacks of things I got to go through and bills and stuff I get super clean on my desk my emails I'm a big hit delete and explode them all at the end of the year guy um but before I do that I put things in files I respond to the things that I owe an answer to I delete the stuff that I don't need everything else goes into a folder and I try to go in Net Zero into 2025 that's really important I don't want to come back back from my vacation January 1 and be sitting with an inbox with 700 emails and just like you know just feel like I have to play catchup the first 30 days of the year I don't want to play catchup I want to attack I want to attack so I come in I come in naked on my emails I unsubscribe I go through all the stuff that I have subscriptions to I unsubscribe I un I delete all the apps that I use again just trying to get light you know I get rid of all clear out all the apps I clear out my cars make sure that you know have no clutter in there and um I create files for 20125 where you know maybe I I'm still a paper guy so I keep records of my medical files I know people have them on digitally but I keep a paper file I still get my bills paper I put them in files so but again I I have a system so I'm not like playing catchup and um so I come I get super light on all that stuff and then I can't recommend this enough I write handwritten letters to the 20 to 30 people that really impacted me or helped me even you guys man having me on you know you might get a thank you note thank there 8 billion people in the world guys thank you too for having me on your podcast like you thought of me thank you I write I write in you know a handwritten letter to my suppliers my contractors maybe a teacher my son's coaches for football I want to thank them this year you know um with no purpose other than really giving like a thank you I've been doing this about that for 30 years when I was 23 years old and I had no money and I was sleeping on 18 different couches my entire marketing strategy was I wrote 10 handwritten letters a day and I mailed I wrote 3,000 letters I'm not even kidding and I still to this day do that because it breaks through the Clutter people remember it people read their mail they might not read their DMS text slacks and all that stuff but they read their letters that come in the mail and there's a different intention I took the time I wrote it I licked the envelope I went to the mailbox I put a stamp on it I put it in there like it comes with a lot of love man is a lot different than hitting send on an email are you still doing are you still doing all that or I'm not gonna talk about anything I don't do no what I meant is uh I've like wanted to send email uh letters to a lot of people and then I'll be like but is there a service where I can just type it out and they mail it out for me yeah it doesn't work that way he's like are you listening no I I the audio coming through I do it by the way I send letters as well but then I like have a stack I have like um a few years ago I got some stationary and it like feels good to like write letters to people but every once in a while I'm like I don't feel like writing this is there a service and then I'm like what the hell am I doing and so I wasn't sure you're doing yeah you can't Outsource it you can't Outsource it you know um as a business owner like I've realized that you can't Outsource Soul you know and the DNA of a business is the soul of the business the heartbeat of a business you can't Outsource that and customers feel soul and your friends feel soul and when you start Outsourcing things that you know for hundreds of years humans have been doing themselves it loses a little bit and I found that that twoh hour investment how about this let's do an experiment for your listeners take 10 envelopes 10 take 10 pieces of paper and take 20 minutes and write a thank you note or to your parents to your kids teachers whoever saying hey this year I just want to thank you for investing so much time with my kids or whatever you want to write lick the stamp put in an envelope and watch the return on investment watch the return on investment and I found that um there's nothing like quite like it now that might sound ridiculous hokey but I've been do it for 30 years and people still thank me no one gets a letter from you like that and doesn't remember or hit you back uh there was a guy who came on by the way and he held up he was he does the same thing uh this guy gu spear he's value investor and he held up he goes I do this but he's like why did I start because I went to um The Berkshire hathway Summit and I went to this event and then he goes afterwards here's what I got in the mail it was a letter Warren Buffett had written him a letter it was two seconds it was guy thank you for coming really appreciate you being there sign Warren and he goes if Warren Buffett is doing this I can do this too I get one from Coach K I know you're a Duke guy I get one from Coach K every year check this out look at this let show you guys something this all of these letters all of these letters and there's I have boxes of these all of these letters check this out these are all letters that I got this year I've read them all I keep them all in this box and at the end of the year it's going in a thing and then I'm starting a new box that's gonna say 2025 because I've been talking about this for a long time and um you know I'm in a really unique spot I'm in a business where people write me letters you want to talk about finding your mission imagine waking up going to your mailbox and and and to to letters of people thanking you for you know sharing best practices or you know helping whatever it is what a what a gift right what a freaking gift if if everybody does the three things that we're GNA talk about in the next 20 minutes in 2025 and does everything else the same that they did in 2024 at the end of the year if they see me in an airport they're going to be hug me because they're going to be like that was so easy and I can't believe how much better my life just got that's what we're going to cover hey guys so a huge part of the growth of this podcast is thanks to our presence on YouTube and without YouTube I don't think we'd be as big as we are now and it's all because of you guys for watching we see you in the comments even the negative ones it def really bothers me but I read all of them and we see how powerful this platform is for growing an audience well if you're planning for the next year and you're thinking about investing in a YouTube strategy for your business then you have to check out this new guide from HubSpot it covers everything you need so building a Content strategy it covers understanding the YouTube algorithm and how to leverage SEO tactics and then it also talks about the different content types and examples to create engaging content so don't miss out grab the guide and set yourself up for success next year now let's get back to the episode so the first thing is is closing out the year getting light doing all those things you know to get light writing handwritten letters and then the the other thing that I do is I I try to identify like what I want to fix going into next year because you know like everybody wants to be a 10 out of 10 no one signed up to be an 8 out of 10 the 80 you know a B minus everybody wants to be as close to they a 10 out of 10 but if you have certain things that are broken even if you make a bazillion dollars and your business goes up 50% and your crazy growth you're never going to be a 10 out of 10 if like the marriage is broken you know something is wrong whatever so what I always tell people to do is imagine you guys had you guys can do this right now imagine you had a big blender and in the blender you put all the buckets Sam that you were just talking about all the buckets in your life into the blender your finances your health your weight your relationships where you live like everything going on in your life put it in a blender shake it up and then on a one to 10 with 10 being like the ultimate in happiness and one being Rock Bottom like again what's your number your weight your relationships your work your finances you put it all in your shake are you a seven are you a five you don't have to tell me are you an eight are you what like what are you now what I love about that exercise is immediately your brain goes to a 10 and then the two or three things that are bothering you pop in your head like crystal clear and take that number down so maybe it was like oh my finances aren't there or like I hate my job or things aren't great in my whatever came into your head those are the things you got to work on they're not going to magically get better like you don't just like oh you know like my my relationship stinks it just like magically get better you got to work on it and did anything pop into your guys head right away yeah so I I put it all in the blender I got to an eight and a half and right away you're you're right I started at a 10: because I'm I'm happy right and then I said well I do the weight's got to come down a little bit all right the weight's got to come down a little bit so that's that's a point off you're not I want to have healthy habits that I'm proud of and then the second one was um you know I I think I'm really good at this content thing I love making content but I'm still spending way too much of my time in my business is and I I really want to make that shift from operator to Creator and i' i' made I've made good progress but I'm not all the way where I want to be there I had a six I had a daughter and I'm loving being a father and she's fantastic that's a 10 finances I did really well that's a 10 but I'm bombarded with inbound messages and I don't have a system to where I'm saying no to 10 minutes at a time uh the 10-minute time requests and contact switching is ruining my life it feels like I can't get in the flow so I'm going to give my give it a six okay a six overall yeah because the context switching it like I get so much joy being in the flow of something and I both a combination of lack of system and addiction to social media and text and all that [ __ ] it's brought me down a whole bunch you know two thoughts one when you're doing the exercise there's no comparison against anybody else so like you know if you are comfortable with the money you're making or whatever you're not comparing yourself to Buffet it's like you know I'm comfortable where I am you're never going to win the comparison game because there's always gonna be someone so that's one thing just to think about and then you know not to knock you at all Sam I think that was super honest of you but like for anybody out there that was a six if like if my son comes home with a 60 on a test it's an F yeah no but I'm agreeing with you like it it it brought me down a lot but the good thing is it's all fixable and you have to identify it and like look I'm not here to be a therapist or preach all I'm saying is knowing what those things that are that need a little bit of help and if it's your weight you know then just in 2025 be like you know what man everything's clicking I'm gonna address this I'm just GNA be a little that's all you know so but but you have to my point is for the listener like you got to identify it because if you don't it just keeps compounding and and then you're playing it's just harder to like catch up when it's compounding so you close out the year you get light you clean the closet clean the desk clean the cars you email bankruptcy you get the files you write the handwritten letters you give thanks you do the blender exercise you identify the two or three shifts I'm trying to make that is that clo is that how you close out the year or is there anything else to that a personal review and just to make it super practical are you like writing this down are you just thinking about it do you say it out loud do you do this with somebody else do you look at your calendar how do you even go back through the could you just give us like if I wanted to say down an hour after this cuz I'm so pumped after this episode I wanted to go do this can you just give me the like kind of the a little more detailed instruction on how I would do it well I get really excited about getting light like you know so I don't have to write anything down to clean up clean my closet and my desk and my emails like that's all just something that like you know you feel accomplished when you do that and we're doing all the other stuff anyway we're we're we have businesses we're doing all this but you just feel really good about yourself as far as like handwritten letters I do make a list I keep it every year of like kind of just man I just think about like what podcast were I on for me was I on who really went above and beyond for me this year or my kids or my family you know I had a I went on a trip to to Africa we had a great tour guide um I had a gentleman in Kenya that ran with me every day to to like chaperon me through the jungle I'm GNA understand him and like just that kind of stuff and I don't want anything for it just makes me feel good and I know it probably makes them feel good so I do all that and then I and then like again you just took that exercise took 30 seconds to identify what we got to work on and then I just make a me a mental note about it like you know I want to get better at it this whole process we're talking about it's like super fast all right so that's the first thing the second thing I do is I have a planning system that I've been using that I I swear by it's there's three steps and this is what I was talking about if you do these three things you going to bear hug me very simple so the first thing that I do is um there's an old Japanese ritual called the misogi and we took we took the liberty to tweak the exact definition of it it but but the way we look at it is that the the concept around a misogi is every year you do one big year defining thing so again at the end of the the year even though you're busy with all this stuff you have one year defining thing thing that to really show for your time over the 365 so for example like two years ago and this is big I rode my bike Across America last year I did rim to rim to rim with some friends in 2015 I launched a book living with the seal 2017 I launched a company called 2929 like every year going back literally like you know 20 years ago I can name like the one thing that I did that was really really year Define so at the beginning of the year I just I might not have that idea and that could be like I'm going to launch a podcast I'm going to quit smoking I'm going to run my first marathon you know but like what is that one thing that you're gonna look back to someone says was your I was unbelievable man I roll my freaking bike across the country I ran the New York Marathon this year you know I think that's really really important now a it's important because like you want to have somebody to show for it but D um I find when you have something on the calendar a goal something like that you're something that you're working towards um that's challenging you you show up at work and at home completely different you show up completely different a if I'm running a New York Marathon Sam I now have to say no to the things that that I don't have the time to give people because I got to train I'm adding you know hours of training in so not now you have a vehicle to say no to things but B you know have something that you're looking forward to one of the books that I read this last year I think it was Michael something uh Easter maybe uh the Comfort crisis and he talked about the misogi I had one it was a 50- mile race and the the the Mogi was uh you have a 50% chance of failing uh I ended up uh uh hurting my achilles really badly and I was like [ __ ] so I I failed uh and it was awesome though have something look forward I'm picking a new one now um yeah but you didn't fail Sam you just didn't finish yeah yeah yeah yeah but but it was hard ass work and it was awesome it felt great to have that on the calendar yeah but what you did was amazing you're saying I'm gonna go double the longest run I've ever done in my life okay I'm gonna do an ultramarathon on top of everything I I have going on I'm gonna challenge myself it may or may not work that that's not an F I mean that's an a an adventure you just didn't finish it I mean not everything we do is going to work I've had businesses that have failed races that I have dnfs but I love that you put it on your calendar look my kids I have four kids 15 10 10 and nine all right you know what they're talking about right now they're talking about that we're going skiing in two weeks so they're going to school and I'm like guys two more weeks of school then we're going skiing because that's on their calendar it's helping them go through school focused lock in because they know they're going to get this reward winter vacation coming up adults are the same way like I'm willing to go work really hard if I know I have a vacation coming up or a race that I'm gonna do or something that I'm excited about so having one big year defining thing really important do you know what yours is going to be for 25 I don't I don't and that's okay but I know that I'm gonna have one and what it does is it also like opens up my mind to Adventure which Mogi do you look back out on most fondly uh if you look back you know 10 years or so I did a race called Ultram man which is a 6.2 mile Open Water Swim a 275 mile bike and a 52 mile run and I I I was insanely I was going to defer to the following year two weeks before the race because I didn't I had swam at all I I didn't I didn't have a wet suit and the water was 57 degree so I called it my friend who's a coach and I'm like you know listen I haven't been training at all zero and there's no I don't think I can do this and I'm thinking about deferring thinking he's going to be like of course defer train so you don't get hurt and he was like absolutely not the challenge is going to be you know if you train for a year you're gonna be able to do it you have no idea if you're going to do it dude a six a six mile swim alone would take like three and a half hours right or if you're a bad swimmer like me five but yeah and also like 57 degree Waters is I I did a a marathon 57 degre it was horrible or Tron it was awful Sam I showed up at the event and I jumped into the water the day before and my I I literally like my face hit the water and it was like you're like I'm out out I'm done it's like it's like it's like getting punched in the nose like for the first time when you want a box you're like this sucks dude I don't I don't to do this but I finished it I finished it and um you know when I was going through this event those th those kind of challenges it's really important to break things into digestible bikes if you're starting a business you want to put things into digestible bikes so when I started Marquee jaet if they would have said you need FAA approval Department of Transportation approval build a sales team raise my I like I'm was a kidy pool attendant for you what are you talking about I mean what what did you say the first thing I needed was FAA approval well there's got to be a lawyer that does that specializes in that let me get got that guy got what was the second thing we need like so it was the same thing here I got to swim 10 six miles impossible can I swim to that to the next to the buoy yes can I swim buoy to buoy yes so let me just break this down into 40 buoy to buoy swins because I can let me break the I can run for seven minutes forever so let me run for seven minutes walk for three and just repeat that cycle and that that's sort of how I attacked it in any event we pick a Mogi all right so I don't know what mine is yet Sean for next year but I know I'm gonna have one and just for the listeners you know just the notion of like yeah you know what I want to have something on my calendar now you like you've like reprogrammed your brain to just be aware of Adventure and that's already a step in the right direction if you're head down in work the second thing I do is something that I've named after my friend Kevin I call it Kevin's rule Kevin and I were took our our children his daughter and my son my son was eight at the time I think his daughter was nine to Mount Washington in the winter it was it was like minus 30 with the windshield and we have a minus 40 sleeping bag we're sleeping in the snow it's insane and we're camping out overnight and I'm like Kevin he's a police officer in New York I'm like there's eight billion people in the world we're the only four people in the middle of Mount Washington man this is amazing I'm like you know how often do you do stuff like this and he lights up he's like oh he's like every other month I do something one day or one weekend that I normally wouldn't have done I'm like what are you talking about he's like oh instead of like watching the Georgia football game I'll take my kids fishing I'll come to Mt one house go visit my my college friends I'm like well why he goes well if I can't take one day every eight weeks to do something like my work life is is at is out of balance but if I do that I'll have six little Min Adventures a year I'm like yeah he's like well how H how old are you well if you're 35 Sean you live to be let's say you live to be 85 that's 50 years if you do those two things I just said you'll have 50 year defining things and 300 mini Adventures that's an insane life that's an insane life at the end of the day if I have 50 Ultram man kind of things and 300 mini Adventures just because I managed my clock right like I won life do your mini adventures and your M like do they stack to where it's like well I already did the Ultra Man what's like the ultra Ultra Man like are you trying to one up them each time not at all I'm just looking for things that that excite me um so this actually this year I do have a it's not challenging enough for me to consider it like a misogi but I'm going on a a tour of the world's best saas in Finland with 12 friends so we're going for 10 days we're hitting 30 30 plus saunas over the course of 12 Days in in in Finland and you know so that is my a big thing for 2025 hey real quick if you're liking this episode with Jesse you got to listen to the first one we did with him it's a story of how he built his fortune his first business how he failed and then ultimately a mentor stepped in and gave him some some tough love let's say and turned his life around uh he tells a story about how he started a private jet company ended up selling that to Warren Buffett there's a Matt Damon cameo in it crazy stories from this guy he also brainstormed business ideas of what he would do if he was young and needed to build a fortune from scratch again so go check that out it's episode number 504 you can either Google it or in the show notes below we're going to put a link to it and also at the end of this episode we are giving away a few thousand dolls of his big ass calendar the one that he uses to plan his 2025 we say the code at the end of this episode so listen to that and then you can go and get one of those for free all right back to the episode so if I'm getting this right the misogi is more of a challenge something that excites you something that it's a big adventure it's year defining and you have the you'll get the fun of progress along the way as you make progress you'll get the anticipation and then you'll get the year defining a sense of accomplishment whether you win or just you did it um and then the adventures are more about is that just more about non- routine so just kind of making sure you are not just every Saturday we go here every Sunday we do this with my kids and just shaking up the routine with something fun it doesn't have to be super challenging but is that the right way to think about those absolutely it's it's non routine it's planning Adventure planning newness it's prioritizing yourself and it's not it's it's playing life on offense it's not letting your calendar fill up you know look if we just sit back it's going to be weddings meetings conferences appointments and just like what are we do what are we doing how many of those things are uh Jessie by himself or with buddies or Jessie like the family um I love I love to do things with with my friends I love to do things with my family I treat my family stuff differently so I also plan family trips but you know um I have the luxury of time you know people talk about rich and and the first thing that comes into your head is like money obviously and that is important and clearly that's an important part of being rich but there are so many buckets of Rich are you spiritually Rich are you time Rich I'm insanely Tim Rich right now which I think is the most important thing especially in your 50s I'm insanely Tim Rich so I can I have the luxury of doing things spontaneously when I want Etc I'm spiritually Rich I'm socially Rich if we did a little sidebar here because the three of us are all lucky to be in a a position where we don't have to work we could all we could just spend all year training for you know an MMA fight an amateur MMA fight or whatever it is but I think a lot of people who listen to that you know may not be at that you know they still have the job they still have whatever the the you know the day-to-day responsibilities so could you take you know 30 seconds to sort of speak to like how you would maybe is there any difference in how you would approach it you know the Mogi or the adventures if somebody's not like you know financially free where their their calendar is Theirs to do whatever they want with listen I have been doing this since my journey was insane it was crazy my 20s were were spent on couches friends Apartments you know um just trying to like figure it out pay my rent you know all that stuff but I was still so rich with Adventure every year I would go to the Coney Island Polar Plunge on New Year's you know what it cost a subway token subway token you know what it cost to do the trip to Mount Washington with my kids $18 to park we live in a country that offers the most insane rivers mountains national parks oceans hikes strings I mean conferences like you could fill up your life with Adventure I should write a book filling up your life on adventure you know for under $400 a year because you can do it now so you know I I understand that obviously M can be bigger and it's easier for me and that's true but you know I've been doing these things for for a long time I just took my son to the Polar Plunge at Lake laner here in Georgia um you know um there's just so much stuff that you could do that again is outside of the norm right you know people think like you don't have to climb Mount Everest to feel like you've accomplished something you have to just get out there and do something that makes you proud of you you know there's a there's a great story uh you do you know ber Brown so she she has this great story she tells about like her daughter going to like a swim meat and she was scared to do like the swim swim beat she was like I'm not going to do well you know I'm scared I'm scared to even just swim blah blah blah and she she talks about how you know her daughter after the swim meat you know she lost the race she maybe got like you know whatever she wasn't didn't do so well she got out she was feeling kind of bummed and BR Brown's quote is like you know winning isn't winning isn't always about getting first place sometimes winning is just getting off the block and getting wet and uh like you know you jumped off the blocks and you got wet like that's a huge win you you you have become a more Brave person by having done that and I think there's uh there's something to that cuz you know when I hear about the Ultramar uh Ultraman races and stuff like that I'm like ah yeah that's a so far from where I am but at the same time when I heard this ber Brown quote about sometimes winning is just getting off the block and getting wet that changed my perspective I started doing a lot more stuff cuz I changed what winning meant also so Sean like I think a lot of people listen to this stuff and they're like oh Jesse's into fitness [ __ ] and you know I'm also into uh I like weightlifting things like that and I think they like say like well I need to go and do a marathon or a long race that's not true I think that you can do things that fit your interest significantly more because like he's got a hat that says all day running running is your passion like I don't think you have to necessarily do something that falls into that endurance category or whatever is popular I want to this year Sam I want to go to one of those silent Retreats where you sit in a dark room for two or three days but listen we're going into a new year all right and I'm giving suggestions and I recognize that everyone is in a different has a different Dynamic time is different finances are different but I what what I love to get out of this call is I just want to fire people up for the opportunity that we all have to have an incredible 2025 you know go Master something go learn a language you know go learn a certain skill go volunteer you know do something that makes you proud of yourself at the end of 2025 do something that makes you feel accomplished and proud of yourself at 2025 now I'm not saying go ride your bike Across America just because I did that no not at all but do something that you look back on the Year and be like this was this was amazing you know and I'm just saying that there's a lot of things that don't cost money if you're intentional if you schedule it which we'll get to in a second and you play a little bit of offense so misoji Kevin's rule the third thing that I do is very simple you know I found this works a lot better for me than New Year's resolutions and maybe maybe different for other people but rather than doing all these goals and stuff which I never accomplish um I very simply every quarter I add a winning habit in my life for so for example like I I don't drink enough water I'm going to drink 100 ounces of water you know um as a new habit I'm never GNA be late to a meeting I'm gonna add a 10- minute a day meditation practice you know I I I don't know but like what habit did you add last quarter this is crazy but like I'm so inflexible and I found uh something on YouTube that was like physically inflexible I can't even touch my knees you know so I found something that's like five extra exercises you should do before you have a cup of coffee like first thing you do when you wake up so I've been doing these five stretches it takes six minutes pretty much every day and um I could send you guys the link they're really easy so that but but my point is we we are a product of winning habits winning routines and a winning mindset that's what we all want we want to have winning routines winning habits and a winning mindset and by layering in imagine if you do that let's let's just say we took a fiveyear look on life my life's going to radically change in five years I have a 15-year-old son he'll be at College my my kid my little boys now they're going to be in high school like I like to look at things in fiveyear Windows because you like if your parents are in the are elderly they might not be here in five years like mine mine were five years ago mine aren't now like your life changes freaking like this got to think about this stuff and imagine in five years you just did the three things that I said you had five insane experiences you added 30 manyi Adventures that you wouldn't have had by taking a you know six days of 365 a year I mean come on man and now you added you know you added 20 winning habits you're [ __ ] Jason Bourne you're Jason B and like this is not difficult well so uh all this stuff I'm like this is badass okay tell me how you plan it and how you actually put it in practice you're saying like you're a you're a product of your habits and things like that what's the habit of planning and like thinking of these things and actually getting them on the calendar or whatever so I don't know you know people listening this audio or video but this is my entire 2025 if you're not on YouTube he's holding up the big ass calendar so so I as soon as I know I have something I for me I put it on my on my calendar on paper I write it down now there's a lot of research around writing it down versus putting it in your phone goals that are written down versus you know there's a ton of research around that but as soon as I have any of these trips I put it down I put all my big events for the year down immediately last day of school first day of school if you have kids first day of camp if they go to Camp last day of camp famp spring break trips date nights with my wife every um I take a a quarterly um station or trip with my wife my wife and I have our own little system we have a date night once a week Wednesdays and then every quarter we try to plan something together could be a like we're going to New York next week but it could be just we're gonna have an overnight station here but we try to make sure we have four year date nights as much as we can family dinners and then the rest is just family trips dude you travel a lot I travel a lot but I put it on my calendar because once it's in my calendar now I have permission to say no uh wish I could go to dinner with you guys but I'm actually um I'm camping out with my kids that weekend like now I'm taking control and I'm dominating the year not other people taking it away from me right well you can laugh about it but I'm dead serious I'm laughing because I think it's cool you know that experiment where they take a jar and they're like all right you have these rocks in these sand F put them in the put as much as you can in the jar and basically if you put the sand in first you can't put any of the rocks in right cuz all the little meetings and appointments and zoom calls and everything else takes up all the space versus if you put the rocks in first and then you could pour as much sand will fit all the way around it that's basically kind of like the the model of what you're doing you're basically saying I'm going to put all the [ __ ] I really want to be intentional about the life experiences I'm going to remember with the people I care about I'm going to put those on the calendar first and then I'll let all the little knick-knack appointments fill in around that where there's still space and if I do it the other way like most people do where you say yeah yeah like when I have time then I'm going to do something great and then they never have time and nothing ever happens rocks never get in exactly and the reason why guys I like to have this on one big visual like look at all 365 days on one page the reason why I like to do that is a I'm visual like I need to see it you know we're all we all kind of think in pictures and we think visually but now two two things one I can see where my gaps are I can see where my gaps are where I have more time available and not two I can track towards my goals so much better than versus like if they live you know in my phone and I use my phone for my appointment Zoom calls and all that stuff but I don't like scrolling through it to be like oh my marathon and I'm scrolling all the way to November I like to see it like oh I have this many days it's like the road map is visual so for you know to have it all on one big calendar is is really helpful and I'm super spontaneous you know I know that I look if you don't plan it it probably won't happen so knowing that after being on Earth for five and a half decades what do I do I want to plan as much as I can I want to get in front of it so I sit with my wife We sync up all of our stuff you know in 2025 we're going to like I said I'm going to Finland we have a trip to Japan we're going to Greece you know we we have put all this down on our C my 2025 is already mapped out and it's insane all I have to do is follow the script now yours might not be as as you know wild as mine um but the point is you can troll it and you can map out this incredible year do you but do are you picking those quarterly habits as well as those mini Adventures I'm not I'm not because I'm open I'm always listening to people and and when I was when I had Marquee jet which is a company that I had I started with my partner when I was I don't know 29 30 years old um my dad owned the plumbing supply house I had no relationship with money we never talked about it I had no business experience I didn't know [ __ ] and all of a sudden I had this private jet company we're flying 3,000 of the who who of Pop Culture CEOs top CEOs athletes entertainers and I'm getting access to these people and I'm really curious I'm 30 years years old and anytime I had a minute with anybody at the airport if I was visiting a customer client I would say to them like I want to know how they live the rich like you mentioned people here might not be well they might be one day who's going to tell them how to do where do you vacation what do you do with your money what time do you go to bed how many newspapers do you read I want to know it all I want to know the best habits and routines and mindset from the best people on the planet and I became sponge and I remember asking this guy sitting down with this guy I'm not gonna say his first name is James he was insanely wealthy I'm 30 I'm like nothing and I I asked him I said James how do you live rich and he's like he sent to me I read and he you walk me through his through his day and where he vacations and what he does with his money and how much gold he has buried in his backyard and all this [ __ ] never forgot it one thing that he said to me one thing he said to me he goes and I take three hours a day for myself and I'm I can never do that there don't no it's cumulative I'm like well what does that look like you James he like I might take a 30 minute son in the morning I might take a little time at lunch to read go for a walk work out da d da the end of the day it's about three hours a day for myself and I I was like since then I'm like and I was like why and he was like well you know if you check the ubbox you show up as a parent husband been CEO boss employee so much better you don't resent your wife or your husband or your partner for taking away time of the things you want to do all this stuff long story short I started taking two or three hours a day right after that me I'm like they worked for him I'm not gonna wait till I have a bazillion dollars I'm gonna do it now so time Rich something that we talked about earlier doesn't mean you have to be rich to be Tim Rich you have to be organized scheduled and allocated to prioritize you and that's all I'm saying for 2025 you might say Jesse this is Hokey Pokey fine but all I'm telling you is carve out time for you to give you Adventure make you feel com work's always going to be there it's always gonna be there on a week toe basis do do you make a list of your to-dos for the week before yeah so um I look at my week on Sunday night I take it from my calendar and from my phone and I put it on paper I use a planner but you can also just write a piece of paper and I write down my day it's like I can move things around and then I can prepare better I know it's I like to have a weak at a glance view of everything and then and then the last thing I would say this is L like a little bonus thought for people is remember when you were a kid and I don't know if your parents gave you vitamins did they give you vitamins when you were a kid like four School Flintstones Vitamins for sure yeah Flintstones right I Flintstones Vitamins as a kid anti Flinstone vitamins but that's that's that'll be podcast number three the the the the vitamins were like you know you take one vitamin and it had like you 500% of everything you needed in every category in like one little pill and I that's unbelievable but you know you took your daily vitamins and it checked all the boxes so I have my own version of this that I do Sam um and Sean that that works really well so like if you made a list imagine you all the time in the world you could do whatever you wanted to do every day what how would you spend your day well I know exactly what I would want to do I love saunas I love coal plunges I love running biking swimming and exercise I love doing breath work I love taking walks with my wife I love playing with my kids like I'm very clear on what it is by the way no where I say do I say I love buying art but I don't those are the things I love to do they're very simple I inherited that from a very simple man my dad the let's say I have 10 of those things on my list okay those are my vitamins those are the things that make me strong that I need every day I try to do two take two or three of those vitamins I can't do them all but I I try to do two or three so today it's we're recording this now it's one o'clock but I've already gone for an hour run and I've taken an hour sauna so of the three hours I allocate for myself I've already done about two of them so like my day is good and I've taken two of my vitamins so now when I show up for you guys I'm all in I'm not Outsourcing like we talked about I'm all in you know because I checked me I'm showing up so much better that is so fraking important and that's every day for me this is amazing um this is awesome is there before I ask you my my kind of I have one burning question before I ask you my burning question is there anything else in the planning how to make a kickass defining 2025 is there anything else we miss before we do that uh do that or were those the big ones I think at like a high level trying to get people to rethink how they approach the new year I think that you know just get started on those things I mean you might not have it all laid out I don't have it all laid out yet but put the stuff you want to do down first on a calendar or wherever you want to put it and build a year that you're super proud of because let me let me just say this Sean we don't get a lot of years we don't get a lot of years and we don't know how many years we're going to get so shame on you if you waste 2025 because you want to like oh I'll just do it NE the following year don't like time doesn't work like that you don't have the luxury of like you don't dictate the pace sometimes the pace dictates you and circumstances change and like you know everyone thinks like I guarantee you everybody here knows they're gon to die that's listening to this but I guarantee less than 1% of our listeners have their graveyard plot picked out because they don't think they're gonna die anytime soon they don't think that like your life could change like that my life's been turned upside down I have people that my friends are getting diagnosed with [ __ ] you know like it changes man you can go outside and someone could be texting and you get smacked it just it could go like that you don't know so you know I'm 56 years old the average American lives to be 78 I don't know I'm not really good at math but that's 22 years if I'm average and you know I was on a lake this summer I didn't see a lot of 78y old guys weight boarding like the the years that you have to do an Ultram man what do they say um I was just listening to something they said what 63 is the shelf life of like healthy years or something you know like it's insane so you it's also insane that you plan these you like well I'll get to it when I'm older but then when you're older it's like I don't want to [ __ ] do that you know what I mean like uh you know I've always criticized actually waren Buffett where he talks about like delayed gratification and things like this and I'm like dude you you've been the man for years like you enjoy it enjoy that [ __ ] now like sometimes p time rich man you don't have to be rich to be time Rich that book that went kind of viral this this year last year die with zero talks about some of these principles but he has this great story about one of them that he was talking about when he was in his 20s and he was on his career ladder climb and he was at some Investment Bank and his buddy we worked with him they were kind of both 23 years old or whatever was like hey dude what if we just go to Europe backpacking for like you know six weeks he's like how are you going to get six weeks off he's like I'm not I got to quit and like I hope I'll be able to get the job when I come back but like I'm going to do this and he was like dude you're crazy that's like irresponsible I'm going to do the responsible thing and he didn't do that and he's he told himself he would do it you know maybe next year or the year after that maybe some some reason he'd be able to do it in the future so you know he's like as soon as he sh came back after six weeks he didn't have the job back but he he met up with the guy he's like from the glow on this dude's face I realized then I made a mistake he talks about how when he was 33 then 10 years later he finally like took a career break and he's like went to Europe he's like it's not so cool sleeping in a hostel when you're 33 um you know it's a different he's like I learned that some things you can't even just it's not even just doing them later is worse he's like it's just not the same thing like that's a 23y old trip I didn't do it when I was 23 I did it when I was 33 or 34 and I had to have a whole different experience there was no going back to that I think it's really important to say yes to Adventure and um it's never the right time you know like it's never going to be like oh I have eight days that are clean you have to make it you have to create that you know I think that's really important message like it's never the right time you're always I'm going to miss the basketball game you know there's always a sacrifice but if you don't do it just you know you have regret you just regret it you just don't get it back well you said yes to an Adventure you're coming to our basketball camp with Mr Beast so we'll be seeing you in January for one of those Jesse thanks for coming on and if you're listening to this you made it to the end you're fired up like I am we're giving away a few thousand of these calendars so go to Jesse what's the site where people buy the calendar I have the code here but it's just jesse.com I think you get it on my on my website so go to jesse.com and then use the code win 2025 so win 2025 first 100 people that go through go there from this podcast will will get a free big ass calendar but if you didn't just buy the thing and start planning your year uh if you're not convinced at this point something's wrong with you I had so much fun on the first go around you know Sam gave me a little put me put me under the uh the microscope a little bit I loved it I loved it that's his job and I get it and um you guys are awesome man like I always get a lot of DMS about our our first episode so um to get an invitation back was meant a lot to me man so so you'll get a handwritten letter from me I think people don't realize because I mean we host a lot of these and I think um people forget this but like I saw Sean writing like I like take notes uh I like just these are my golden nuggets from this episode These are you know my pen died halfway through we appreciate you doing this thank you very much until round three Jesse thank you thank you [Music]

this is the first AI agent thing that has like been a mind-blowing moment for me where I am not a programmer I am not a coder but I can now create software well that's insane there are apps built on repet agent that otherwise would take probably $100,000 of developer time and you can build it like in you know $25 pay to repin it's pretty wild how fast these companies are scaling I don't think in the history of Silicon Valley we've seen anything like that even in the like Web 2.0 Arrow so what is like a fast ramp for an AI company what's impressive that kind of broke the frame of what how long things would take so I I would say reaching 10 million in 3 to 4 months ARR oh my God that's wild can I ask a blunt crude question how can I use your software to become a billionaire I would say building [Music] okay so uh how do we want to start this so omj you um you're awesome so you have you're today in a position that I think a lot of people want to be in you have you're doing the Silicon Valley dream you had this idea you go through YC you've now raised hundreds of millions of dollars you're valued at a you know billion dollar valuation so that's today but then the cool thing about your story is that that didn't seem likely you know 10 years ago is a very likely success story and yeah you went through YC but you were rejected a bunch of times like yeah you're in Silicon Valley now but you started off coding in an internet cafe in Jordan that's what's interesting to me and we asked you beforehand we're like hey what killer stories could you come on the podcast and tell and you go you wrote this so I'm going to read it word for word and then I want you to tell us the story you go rejected four times and Rick Rolling into YC raising tons of money and meeting amazing billionaire so let's do the first part rejected four times and Rick Rolling into YC can you tell the story yeah so I left my uh job at at Facebook in uh 20 2016 and you know repet has been a side project for a while and it's been it's been growing I've been working on it like nights and weekends it grew to to a point where the like server cost was meaningful and I was like okay you know I have to I guess I have to start a company around it and so I went to my manager at Facebook and I was like look I have the side project can we make it like somehow a project at at Facebook Facebook and we looked into that I sent Zuck an email at the time and he he ignored me like okay I guess I guess I have to start I guess I have to start a company and so yeah I quit I quit my job um applied to YC the first time we did the whole thing we did the the form and the video and and all of that and we didn't even get a get a call or anything like that it was it was just like we got the rejection uh letter and so I was like okay you know I have to this uh Facebook stock some savings I sold the Facebook Stock I put like half of it in Bitcoin and then half of it into into the company or like just just for us to kind of live and how much money was that was like 70k or or something like that what was the original uh product for of repet so it was basically an editor and a console you could type code there and you can run it you can switch a language and that's it by the way Sam have you ever used I was using it today before this it's magical and also your tweets describing what it is like for example your doctor saying you know he wants me to track my sleep so I just uploaded the PDF that he wanted me to fill up fill out into repet and it made an application so I can upload it much easier yeah it's like pretty magical Sean are you able to use it it's definitely out of my league still both me and Sam have joked around because we both uh have maybe five or six times fall started of like I'm going to learn to code this summer it's like a New Year's resolution thing where you just keep saying you're going to do it you you do 20% of it 30% of it and you give up uh you know we buy the the Udi course Learn Python the Hard Way then you start doing it and nothing really ever stuck and one of the biggest problems was that nobody really talks about this you think learning to code is like learning Spanish it's like learning a language you're like okay so how do I need to say the thing but before you can even do that it's like oh I'm supposed to download this program so I need to download an editor and then I need to download all these packages to be able to use St and then you need to and it's like just setting up the environment is so goddamn confusing to a beginner that you don't even get to do the the part where you actually write the code and be able to and then it's like oh how do I run the code I got to host it somewhere now I got to learn how to do hosting and ser like what is that and so there's all these things around it that were confusing repet solved all of that which was amazing and I actually did your like 100 days of learning to code like it's actually made it really easy you know if I didn't have kids I would just be doing a lot more because it's you you solved that problem for me and I know I'm asking you about the YC rejection I want to come back to that but to give Sam maybe a little more of context I think correct me if I'm wrong maybe I'm making this up I think the reason you wanted to have this kind of like online editor online environment where it's all hosted there was because when you were younger you were living in Jordan and I guess you used to go try to learn to code out of an Internet or go try to code out of an Internet cafe but that means every time you go you have to set everything up for the first time because it's not your it's not your home base not your home computer where you set it up once and it's there is that true is that why you have you felt the problem like x what a normal person would feel yeah basically like every time I wanted to do a little homework I have to like spend an hour setting up the environment at the time the web was moving so fast until we had Google Docs and we had Gmail we had this you know client side JavaScript application sort of Revolution uh and I'm like okay you know why can't I type code into the browser and run it and I started looking around and turns out like nobody solved this problem there were some experiments and it it was kind of crazy to me because uh it was almost like you know finding a $100 bill in uh New York Grand Central Station right like it's like oh I found an idea that nobody's paying attention to and is that true cuz cuz it's kind of crazy you know the world is Big a lot there's a lot of programmer that seems like an obvious thing I mean I'm a total Outsider so my question is like was there some technical challenge to that cuz that seems like I I I guess it's easy to say things that are successful are obvious ideas looking back but like yeah prob two things right there's the technical challenge of being able to make this all work in a browser right that that was that was not obvious but then this seems like the second thing was I keep going back to the internet cafe thing because it's sort of like the hardship made the problem like unavoidable to you whereas anybody else who learns to code if you're just doing it at home in America and your your you might do that setting up once maybe have a a little bit of the problem but you're not running into it face first every every day as if you were if you were working out of internet cafe yeah absolutely right I mean you know Paul Graham talks about it all the time it's like you know the best startups are you know solving your your own problem and I felt that problem really deeply and I started working on it I discovered why it's hard well it's it's hard to run different languages in the browser you can run JavaScript but you can run python for example so we started writing interpreters uh writing compilers to to to run on on JavaScript and then in you know it took us a couple years had like few languages running it was like pretty rough prototype but people started using it my friends and people at school and I'm like okay this idea has lags and so let me work on it more and then 201 uh had a breakthrough and the Breakthrough was we were the first to compile python Ruby a bunch of languages to JavaScript and run them straight in the into the browser and that went super viral like so we open sourced it we put it up uh and like on Hacker News and that was my first experience of like going viral on the internet which is I I was like oh my God this is this is like an amazing rush and I still feel that Rush can you put that in context for a non non-engineer is the thing you guys did is it on a scale of like one to Satoshi Nakamoto solving the like double spin problem like how hard of an invention was that that was like the nerdiest analogy you ever could have came up with that's what I'm here for so like was it was it genius or was it just that nobody had taken as much time as it would take to do that like where was that breakthrough how do how would you describe that breakthrough uh it it's definitely not on the order of like the double double spend problem where it's like a fundamental in invention it was like you know pushing like a a huge Rock bolt like uper uper Mountain it took so much grit and and and just Obsession to be able to hack the browser in order to run things that the browser wasn't uh uh supposed to run wasn't designed to run and so I would say it is solving hundreds of problems as opposed to solving like you know one one invention uh which double yeah so you you're working on it as a side project for a number of years that's a long time by the way Sean can you imagine like having a side project that's a hobby that takes three hours a night with little I mean two doing that for two years is kind of a long time no dude the only two things I've ever done that with is this podcast and my kids and there's really no way out of the kids thing so you know and the podcast was a hit right away the podcast yeah gave me results right away so it actually doesn't count you were doing this without the kind of like Financial Rewards or fame Rewards or any other major rewards during that time how many years did you do the side project thing and what kept it going you know 2009 was the original idea 2011 was the Breakthrough and you know went viral on on on Hacker News and and the internet and I I think that was the first time I felt like a little bit of of Fame a little bit of uh return on investment uh like I remember Brendan Ike the inventor of JavaScript and was the CTO ad mosella like tweeting about it I was like wow this is amazing like you know you know kid and Jordan like made this like fundamental breakthrough and like you know browser Tech and like I'm getting this recognition that's pretty cool and also some articles I wrote about it it was people talked about it in conferences and so all that was evidence for my 01 visa to come to the states basically my entire adults life I'm working in this uh which is crazy right like was I am uh 36 wow I think uh and uh you know well you've been working on this since you're uh 20 21 I think uh yeah 21 yeah that's that's a while that's your whole life your whole adult life and you know it continued to like you know incrementally improve my life so it wasn't it wasn't this you know working in a in a room for 11 years and and nothing happen so I get this visa to the United States uh and I go work at COD Academy and they use the open source work that that that we did right and a bunch of companies in the US there was like this boom and like uh if you remember that Udacity chera whatever and a lot of them used the open- source version of repet to create interactive courses right um and and suddenly like the the world open up open up to me I'm getting job offers uh all over the place and I and have choices where to go and and so we decided to go to New York all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went to them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think nval has this great quote where he says uh people always asking him about like you know how to build a great Network or networking what are your tips for networking and he he's like my only tip for networking is do something great and watch your network will appear overnight people will immediately come to you because you've done something great right you didn't go try to get a coffee with Brendan Ike you build something really cool that the creator of JavaScript and Mozilla browser was like hey that's awesome I want to reach out and get to know you and I think that's actually how you back to the YC thing I think that's how you ended up getting into YC later was Paul Graham actually just thought what you were doing was cool but like let's go to the YC part so you you quit the Facebook job half the money in Bitcoin half the money in your startup appli to YC rejected that was the first rejection what were the other rejections um yeah VCS kind of wouldn't wouldn't talk to us or you know we we'd get meetings with VCS some of them are like yawning and and I think one of them slept um and it it was just like not interesting to them dude I had that happen one time as well like a guy a guy literally fell it was like he he he was literally 80 and it was Friday at 4: and it was warm in the office and he like fell asleep mid mid pitch like it was it was warm yeah it was like a cold day and it was warm inside so I was like yeah I mean like I like you deserve this but dude what what what did they not see in you because like it's so easy to be to look back in the past but like you seem like you got the it Factor this seems like such an obvious idea you worked on it for two years smart people are talking about it like what were you what were you missing what was the case against it well I I I think you know Silicon Valley is like probably the most meritocratic place in the world but it is also status driven at least then it was very status driven like if you look at the white you know people who got into YC like with Stanford drop Hots and and things like that and I think since then YC has has has improved and you know gets international people and all of that but but you know my background wasn't wasn't really interesting to to them you know I didn't have any fancy colleges or or any of that also uh being married uh couple was was somehow like something that that they thought it was a disadvantage you you you didn't match the patterns you didn't match the Stanford pattern you didn't match the uh co-founder relationship pattern you didn't match the uh the trend of of what categories have big exits you weren't on Trend at that time right yeah and so continue to apply to YC every season of YC we'll we'll send in the the application and you know our thesis developed more and we felt like um we had started making some money some people started paying for our service we had an API at the time that people paid for a lot of Educators and and people learning the code started to to pay pay for repet what was the revenue when you got in like maybe 10 Grandad a month M it it was enough to sustain us at that at that point it was like the ramen profitability um but before YC that the person who who actually uh the first one to toet on us was Roy bahad from Bloomberg beta so I knew him from my Cod Academy days and and it was such a the meeting with him was so refreshing like he he was like just a straight shooter he he would tell me like he here's where I think you know the idea or the category is is hard you know here is where I think the valuation should be and it was like the first meeting he just gave me everything he was thinking about he didn't obscure anything and I was I was feeling really good about it and so yeah he gave us 500 uh uh, on a on a 6 million uh valuation so that was the first check uh we got nice and and then how did the how did you eventually get into YC so uh basically um you know we're grinding and and and and the product was getting better every every week and I started writing articles about what we're solving so because we're solving pretty hard problems and so this articles kept going in Hacker News um and Hacker News was really excited about what we're doing and pulgram reads Hacker News a lot probably still to this day and one day like December 2017 I wake up there's a DM uh on on my phone and it is Sam Alman and he's like hey I run YC and we're interested in what you're doing I'm like dude I know who you are you have to tell me run YC and he's like okay let's let's meet you know come to this address and it wasn't the YC address I was like a little confused and so I I go there and it was the openai office in the in the mission uh and so I I meet him there and and you know we're talking a little bit and then he's like he turns his computer around he's like this is uh this is Paul's email uh he emailed Sam and told him this this company is very important you should reach out to them and he's like okay talk to to PG I'm going to give you his email talk to him and then uh maybe you can maybe we can work on something to get you into YC so I started this email relationship with with Paul which was really fascinating I mean he he he's a great writer right and so we talked about uh we talked about repad we talked about the the the problems of setting up an environment the problems of hosting an application and turns out after he sold uh via web he started working on on something like repet he started working on like an editor you write some lisp of course cuz he like likes this this very obscure program languages and but by the way Paul Graham is the founder of YC at the time he was starting to to retire and and Sam was was running YC and uh and so you know we had this email relationship where he wrote me as is essentially on on on the problem we're solving by the way were you were you intimidated you know Paul Graham writing essays to you privately uh are you like is that high stakes replies there for you yes like I I would spend hours uh kind of crafting the the emails and uh and trying to like be as good of a writer as as I can um but you know one thing about me is like I was never like nervous about meeting like famous and established people and I think that helped me uh over time because like you know I can be myself and I like can talk to them at the same level as supposed to like being a fanboy or or yeah why why was that what what were you just oblivious to it or you just had a different mindset about it what was the reason yeah I I I felt like my life was was taking on this trajectory that was not to be too superstitious but like it was this Force um and I felt like like everything's going to be great and you know it's going to be hard but you know I'm meeting all these people uh things are opening up to us and um and so when when I go and and and meet people my mindset is like uh I want to impress them and I want to be able to you know get money from them or like I have a goal and I think having a goal when you're when you're meeting someone actually puts you in a very different mindset than than again like fanboying and and um and just being very excited about the meeting dude have you guys seen that uh do you guys know the director guy Richie he's uh that like British director he's got this great story he was on some podcast I Joe Rogan and he was like you know I just want to be the director of of my own life and I want to live my life like a movie and what you're describing is sort of like that where you're like I just I am destined for greatness and like we are taking on this amazing uh problem and like we are going to do wonderful things and it will be hard but we will Triumph and I think that's a that's actually great that's a great story to tell yourself and I think it's very motivating and it it it it makes life more exciting I think that's really cool yeah so I I actually uh wrote a a blog post the title is do what makes the best story uh and and the idea is like when you're faced with decisions where there's no obvious answer like the a fork in the road where the pros and cons are sort of the same theistic I use in my life is like what is a more interesting story and obviously like Elon talks about this like the most uh the most entertaining outcome is is most likely uh yeah I wasn't thinking about it in terms of entertaining but in terms of like what makes the story interesting if if my life was a movie what would what would be exciting about about that story for example when when I was in college I was like coding all the time and I wasn't really going to class and so uh so I was failing a lot not because I was failing the exam because you know they would bar me from the exam because I wasn't showing up and and I decided to to hack the university to change my grades and we're not talking like metaphorically like a life you actually hacked into the servers and changed your grade is that what happened yeah I I went into into the basement I spent like two weeks I did the what's his name the famous inventor Michelangelo or something like that I did his sleep polyphasic sleep where work 4 hours and then you sleep 15 minutes and it was it was sort of like I was writing on the wall I was like it was like a full-on Insanity were you angry why did you decide to act them I know so many smart people who work so much harder to cheat or get around the thing than just doing the thing and and there's like a 50% of the time they end up being like losers and then 50% of the time they are in fact like the greatest they're on this podcast yeah well I I think it is like some ADHD right like you can't sit you can't sit in class but if you're interested in something you're going to like hack and like work on it a ton right and I almost got away with it but the servers at the uh at the University crashed uh and it crashed on my record so the one of the administrators there gave me a call and he he said um look there's like this there's some an anomaly in your in the in the record uh of your exam in in school and it's crashing our databases do you know anything about it and I was like what's the anomaly and he's like you know there there's a field in the database that says you're barred from the exam and your grade should be uh should be 35 that's that's the default grade of of failing the exam and instead my grades were like you know 75 90 whatever um that's the that's what I entered into there and I didn't understand that there was another field by the way that you know that that's not good good design for for a database um and so so since then I I you know I had um there was a fork in the road I I could lie and I think I could get get away with it and you know and and just say like that's a bug on your side and but I was like what's the most interesting story um is they they catch me and it becomes a story that people talk about and and I was like okay I'm just G to I'm just going to like come clean and just tell them what I did uh so you're like better better than getting the grade would be getting the reputation yes exactly so you tell them and then what happened they kick you out no so um you know I I'm kind of a convincing person so I um I go the next day and it's like all the Deans there and they're discussing my case they're like trying to find out what what I did and and they're all computer science Deans so I went in there and I changed the subject to technical aspects of the hack and I drew on the Whiteboard and show them what I did and and all of that and they were very impressed it's like a Goodwill Hunting moment yeah and like my interpretation back then is like I'm I'm a loser I'm failing all everything right I don't show up to class and and it is it is kind of like Goodwill Hunting and then um you know they say okay you have to go talk to the president because I think he he's going to make the final call so I I go uh to the president and uh and he's a very intellectual person and we talk and I you know I tell him like look you know I I have this talent and I feel like it was undiscovered and I feel like I was treated unfairly and and I I Ed the the you know I used the university as my sandbox like I didn't like you know I came clean I didn't uh you know mean to to do anything anything bad and and and and he gave me the Spider-Man line he's like with great power comes great responsibility and it it actually affected me and I was like okay you know you know I think uh you know I you know I I I need to do something in order to to to to kind of pay back and I I told them I'm going to work uh this summer for free to to make sure I secure your your databases and so they they let me off the hook and they're like awesome yeah what a great story dude that is an amazing story Sam by the way would you ever want to compete with AMJ at anything no this is like this mentality this is uh it's scary like yeah I would not want to you're like excuse me Dean have you heard of the word prodigy uh yeah you're like you're like I my talents haven't been used well at this University I accept your apology you're fall dude it's like why are you failing me yes yes that's so good okay so I love the principal do what makes the best story I love the hack story that's that's amazing where we how did we get here we were talking about um YC YC okay sorry let's get to the story YC because that's where we started okay so Sam's like yeah you should do YC actually the batch starts tomorrow why don't you fill an application it's just a just a you know process uh you have to do and we can do a later interview tomorrow and I'm like [ __ ] I'm going to fill the application again like you made me do do it like four times like I don't want to do it again and so you know I I kind of do a Bare Bones application about about ret and then there's the video I'm like yeah man I don't want to I don't want to do the video so so I I pasted a a YouTube link and and we go the next day hi and I by the way for people who don't know the YC application is like one page it's like six or seven questions but then they say upload a video two or three minutes you talking about your startup so that's the video part and then the interview is 10 minutes where they just rapid fire so you have like 10 minutes and it's like this make or break thing it's less than a lunch you know like there less than a job interview it's more intense so you're waiting around for that yeah I mean my view was they recruited us to YC like why are you making us do do do the stuff right and and so yeah I was going to ask that like they're ask they're acting like you know Paul Graham's like you know maybe I could pull some strings it's like I know a guy yeah like you're the guy so I don't understand what they're uh what what they're bullshitting I don't get it well I I think they they wanted to to just like go through the process it's like the process applies to everyone and I I respect that so uh you know the uh they call us to to the interview um and and I walk in and and there was uh Jared and Adora and and and all these amazing voicey partners and there was Michael he was the CEO at the time and I shake their hand and I shake Michael's hand and and I felt like his grip was was a little too hard I was like okay that's fine and then I I go sit down on the chair and and the moment I sit down Michael looks at me why did you recall us oh my God and and I'm like you know we we applied several times and and I thought it'd be fun to do and and you know I thought this this interview was just uh was just you know formality and and and he's like that's it's not how you get into YC and he was he was very very angry Well turns out when we're sitting outside they were getting red inside right say say imagine their mindset looking at the application and and and getting the the the rroll song and uh and then they give us a very tough interview in that moment did you it's like and that's when I realized I [ __ ] up like did you realize like yes how I'm coming across like what was your mindset there like they must be thinking I was nervous I was very nervous and I was regretful uh immediately because you probably it's like oh here's this entitled just another just another tech entitled guy when they don't know you're like immigrant from Jordan who's like scraped his way here right they don't reality and how you were coming across weren't connected in that moment no they weren't at all and uh and so uh and so I you know we go outside and and I tell ha okay this is done let's let's call an Uber and get back to work like we don't have we don't need to get into YC so I call an Uber and uh just before I arrive I receive a call and and I I take the call and it's like hey it's Adora uh you got in come back uh the the kickoff is about to start and I was like what are you sure she's like yeah come back sign sign the paperwork and get started so I was stunned the whole day like it was you know we start we go to the dinner and I'm like you know you know phased out and and all but but like it was really exciting and you know people who who who's never been to the YC office and and Mountain View it's all orange like bright orange and and the lights and everything it feels like a cult-like environment and like is it like I think I've seen the inside isn't it like a like a they they have like a steeple or is in like one of the rooms it like is a a triangle like a church almost yeah yeah exactly and sound gets up and tells us what what the experience is going to be it's like this is the hardest time you're going to work you know you better tell your friends and family that you're going to go away for three months you can't help them move or or all of that you just got to be focused on on work so ha and I like took it very seriously okay I was like okay this these three months are are are very important for for the success of the company and we transformed the product in these three months it went from a simple sort of editor output to a place where you can host applications and built real things and all in three months and we're working you know 12 hour 13 hour day days and um and and it was it was only uh three of us at the time um our first employee actually was um was sort of a runaway kid he grew up in California uh little down down south and uh and he didn't want to go to school and so he leaves his uh his home he goes to hack reactor and uh and he becomes he becomes a programmer and he was 18 he was looking for a job I knew the guys that hacker actor they used ret and I'm like send me your best programmer and he's like look this kid is a little awkward but he's the best and so he comes in he Nails our interview music to my ears yeah and basically I like him CU you know it it mirrors kind of my life story a little bit where's this guy now but we got him we got him some liquidity after six years of working uh I felt that's the right thing to do and because he was kind of burnt out and didn't want to continue so I I called my I called my brother in Jordan I'm like look you got to you got to come out here when YC you need to and he's a program I taught him programming when he was a kid and I was like you got to you got to come come help us and he's still with us today and I called my friend from Cod Academy Moody he's still with us today as well I'm like you got you got to help us like uh like you know you could do it remotely and so we assembled like a team of five people essentially and so we we go really hard and we were like one of the hottest uh companies in YC at the time and uh can you give some sense of the scale of it now like you know um I invested in it pro a year ago or two years ago something like that I don't know when um but the numbers were off you had user growth first your graph looked like a hockey stick because you zoom out and you you you it ignores all of the little like years where nothing was really going on but you have this crazy growth but the crazy thing about it is that your growth was developers so it's like you know one developer user is worth I don't know 10 20 times just like a normal internet user but you have this crazy hockey stick growth of developers can you talk about can you just say a couple of like permission to brag can you say a couple of brag worthy stats that would impress us yeah so so repet was very easy to get started with and so people would start uh start in using it in college or or high school and continue using it for many years and so it was sticky for especially Junior developers when they're starting out um and uh and it was it was spreading on its own like Word of Mouth uh you know there was a viral component to it people can share URL and then suddenly you're in the same environment as them right like and then we have this like multiplier coding experience and so people were collaborating and um and also uh covid was really great for us because we were I think the only collaborative editor experience on the web at the time and so a lot of people were remote and and needed something to work with with each other and so uh repet was adopted at the time and so the growth uh was was off the chart and the servers were going down and the marginal user any web app is sort of like zero zero cost but for us it was uh you know we we Tred to optimize it a lot but it was still on the order of like $1 to5 like a month and you know the growth was off the charts but I I you know I have to admit it was hard to monetize at the time because uh developers are actually not used to pay for things now they kind of are paying for things because of AI but at the time they they weren't uh they weren't paying and then um you know as as we added limits and things like that they felt like they they can like move on and set up their own developer environment and so it to took a lot of you know creative thinking to figure out how to charge for people and ultimately AI was the thing that that people are paying for and the reason is like the productivity benefit of AI is like uh is like obvious um and people was like okay this saves me time and makes me a better developer and so people are paying for it right now well can you give any indication on how many users or how many um how much revenue the business does you know signups we we have like more than 30 million I think 35 million uh users right now in terms of active users it kind of fluctuates but you know three uh you know two to three million a month probably 100,000 uh apps hosted hosted on repad um because you can build an app and and and deploy it all in in one environment um in terms of Revenue I can't share right now but like uh especially this year it's been like exponential growth Sam check this out this agent thing I got to show you this so you you haven't used this right Sam no all right so so watch this so yesterday I was like I'm I'm gonna mess around I was doing research for this but I was like I just got like sucked into repet and I started doing that stopped doing research so I go and I I go repl and it's changed cuz now when you before when you would go it would be like here's a coding screen with a blinking cursor and it's like write some code and I'd be like oh cool I don't really write code so I don't know how to use this product exactly maybe I could learn the code maybe I could uh you know pay somebody to to build something on here but whatever I was stuck so now you open up rep replit and it just it's like chat GPT it just goes so what would you like me to create and so I go on there watch this so I go I'll give you the exact prompt I said build me an app that will text me every morning asking how I ate yesterday let me answer via text messages and then track the results on a monthly calendar grid if texting doesn't work you could also use WhatsApp or something else okay so basically on the right here is just like the chat and it just goes absolutely let me propose what we'll build and then it just kind of like explains to me like a project manager it goes I'm going to help you create a food tracking app through SMS messaging with a calendar visualizations we'll start with the SMS later we can add WhatsApp as an alternative it's like okay okay prioritizing things that's interesting and then it goes the Apple send daily messages blah blah blah and then it goes how would you like me to proceed and it's like there was like you know add more features change the instructions or like go ahead and build the Prototype so I clicked build the initial prototype and then literally I don't know if you can see this but like it starts like Auto scrolling as it's writing code like this is all just a code it's generating so like you know like I'm not doing anything I'm literally sitting back with popcorn while this is happening so it's like here's your calendar grid and it's like uh hey I need I'm going to use twilio for the SMS it decides I'll use twio for the SMS can you go to twilio and give me your account and your phone number so that it will we like we use toio for sending sms so I go to too I give it my SMS and then it's like it's made it literally made the thing exactly how I want so this works now yeah I actually got stuck on the twilio step because twilio has to verify my phone number so it like it hasn't verified it yet but I can go into I in I see it tries to send me the message and it's just as awaiting toio verification to like be able to use this um so I'm like a little bit stuck there which is like a common thing with agents I feel it's like almost absolutely incredible and then kind of frustrating at some point where you have to like you know fight through some walls well I think I'm just tweeted I think he said I want people to be able to build an app faster than they can just Google the answer to a question and that's exactly what happened here well that's insane so this screenshot uh is the agent looking at the result is trying to verify they so this this is not do running app if you click run you can H that running says top took a screenshot and then it shows it to me it's like hey is this how you want it and I was like oh cuz before it had it where it was like not the right month on top I go oh put the month on top like don't say monthly food tracking right December and then it also said like hey would you like any other style improvements I can make it broader I can change the color scheme and I'm like dude this is literally better than an employee right like first it's instantaneous uh second I could you know I don't have to pay pay somebody to sit in desk to sit around waiting for me to do something I had a w idea on a whim go to rep and did the thing with the agent this was a like there's been a few like mindblowing moments for me in my like Tech Career you know like I graduated 2010 so I'll start at that point where it's like the first time I took an Uber I was like holy [ __ ] that was amazing I pushed a button a car showed up the guy got in I didn't even have to pay for like it just paid through my phone that was magic and I could see it I could see him on an app getting closer and closer to the restaurant that was like one of them you know chat GPT for sure was another where I could just you know tell it to make something and would write something it would write it for me this is another one of them this is the first AI agent thing that has like been a mind-blowing moment for me where um I am not a programmer I not a coder but I can now create software this is like amazing can I ask a blunt crude question how can I use your software to become a billionaire because like I see this and I'm like you you you know like the the the ridiculous analogy that I use is I'm like uh I feel like an artist sometimes where like I feel like I have the ability to conceptualize certain things but I can't paint it's like I can't [ __ ] paint what I want to paint that's in my head like because I literally don't have that skill set sometimes and so like I'll be working on stuff and like dude I want this to do this but I got to go talk to this developer and I don't want to have this conversation and that's just like a pain in the ass and so like you basically are making it so I can finally express myself easily I like how you're on the first date you're like how can I get you to take the clothes off what you're like how do I use your thing to get really rich yeah I mean that's basically like like and you had on the document you're like uh here's just here's the opportunities just use repet to do X Y and Z and I want to go through that because this is like amazing this is actually you know there's like there's like a viral clip on YouTube or Twitter like a bunch of places where it's like the the headline which we probably have used which is like billion dooll oneperson companies or something like this you're the closest person to this probably uh to that question to answer that question yeah so there are apps uh built on repa agent that otherwise would take probably $100,000 of of developer uh time and and you can build it like in you know $25 paid to paid to repet I will say that there there's limitations right it it is not it is not perfect this is like the worst it's it's it's going to be it it sometimes gets stuck with problems you can you need to have some skill and prompting to co-ax it to like uh figure it out and it sort of like teaches you over time because it tells you what it's doing as it's editing the code and so over time you're learning how to use you're actually learning how code Works you're learning how maybe you're not learning how to exactly type code but you're learning the different components in where things could go wrong you're learning about database we have like a database you can go in and look at the tables and look what's happening and so you know the vision for this is that that's all you need that's all you need to build an entire uh startup and you know every day we're inching towards that you know and I I talked about like pushing the boulder up up the hill and I think that's one of my one of my talents is like okay what are the problems that you can make progress on every day and every week such that you know in a year time you have this exponential progress and the product is is so much better the other thing is we're writing this wave of the foundation model is getting better so every time they get better we plug in a New Foundation model and the product is is suddenly better so you're writing this you know two exponential curves which is like the engineering we're doing but also the underlying models and infrastructure is is is getting better so I I think in a in a year's time it's going to be really mind-blowing in a couple years time I think we're going to see stories uh like someone getting super rich uh making an app and repet that that sort of goes spiral and so we're adding stripe integration right now you can you can already use kind of stripe on on repet but we're adding integration that makes it super easy to start monetizing your app so so Sam said how do I get rich and you're like disclaimer it's not fully there yet but now you still have to answer the question I mean the question is like what kind of applications it's like what are the ideas what kind of applications you can build I would say AI applications are are growing really fast like the revenue in some of those AI applications it's kind of crazy can you can you tell the story of Magic School I thought this was really interesting yeah so magic school is like an AI application for educators it's it's basically like helping them use Foundation models and llms to do their work to do assignments for for kids to have an interactive like AI experience and so it's like a full Suite of AI for educators the guy who created it is a was a teacher right the guy who created was a teacher he took some time during Co to to learn how to code and he started using repet and him and and I think another person uh built the initial uh thing totally un repet and because you can go from an idea all the way to deployment and and it immediately started growing like um you know people these AI apps like when when the adoption starts happening it goes Super viral you don't need a ton of Market kidding and the revenue ramp was was one of the craziest ones I've seen especially for Education yeah it was like a known thing it was like hardest thing you could do sell in into schools into teachers they're overworked they're underpaid that they don't have the time to like figure out your new tool but this thing is great so if you if you go to it it's basically like because teacher spends a lot of their time not in the classroom it's after after school is done they have to grade papers they have to create the lesson plan for the next day they have to create the quizzes or the multiple choice tests and they have to like so have to constantly do these and there was these platforms like teacher pay teachers where I could just if I don't want to make it myself cuz I'm tired after the school day I might be able to go buy one for nine bucks from another teacher who teaches fifth grade science in some other state and I would take that and I would I would buy it that way what magic school did was it was like cool generate a you just say like I want to I teach you know fifth grade biology I want to do a pop quiz about you know how this how mitosis works and then it'll basically create either a lesson plan or a quiz or you know um a a student like interactive like you know workbook that they need to create or whatever and so it lets a teacher not have to spend you know four hours a night creating the materials that they need just to teach class because AI can do it for them and this thing looks I I don't know these guys I don't know anything about them but it says you know over four million educators are using this which four million Educators and their students which I don't I don't know if they're counting well if you go on similar web they have millions of monthly uniques so that's like a they raised like 20 million bucks too off so I mean that's like a pretty huge signal so they they launched in uh like I want to say July 2023 so they are like a little over over a year and do you know these like SAS metrics are like how long to get to whatever like uh 100 million or whatever the AI apps and I would say magic SCH is on that trajectory is like just like that you know the curve is like you know all the way straight up this is kind of weird but maybe this is like a feature of yours that you helped this company become potentially one of the faster growing companies of all the time and you only earn $20 a month from that yeah so so so repet had you know always a problem of of value capture partly that's why like VC struggled with it for a long time so that there's some Logic for why why it is hard to monetize these things and like capture some of the value uh I will say you know I invested in magic school so there's some of that um and uh with AI I think we're going to be able to you know uh you know capture at least a little bit more of that value if people are monetizing these apps on repet Via the agent uh there's a way I think where we can uh potentially take a a cut out of that especially if we make it like super simple to start monetizing an app and also like if once we reach scale you know it is like Chad like you don't need a lot of skill to do that and it's going to get easier and easier once we reach scale and you have you know millions of people paying for this and it's not just like 20 bucks you're going to pay incremental uh after you finish your credits so we give you CR monthly credits and then afterwards if you want to continue you can like buy more credits are there other companies like magic school like cool companies like that you've seen that maybe we haven't heard of that are using AI yes so um you know I'm very excited about agents right now and uh you I I think I I predicted uh earlier this year on a on a podcast that you know this this is going to be the year where like agents are born and next year is like where agents are are going to scale um so there's uh this company called 11x and 11x creates AI sdrs uh and so basically you don't need to hire sdrs like there are some companies that feel like they you know they can they can boost trp their sales without Sr you can have like one AE and then a account executive is like running these like tens of AI sdrs um and and the revenue ramp on 11x was also crazy it it it's pretty wild how fast these companies are scaling I don't think in the history of silic and value we've seen anything like that even in the like Web 2.0 era so what is like a fast ramp for AI for maybe not 11x specifically but just for an AI company what's like what's imp what's impressive that kind of broke the frame of what how long things would take but you've seen it now yeah so I I would say reaching 10 million in 3 to four months R oh my God that's wild yeah we I invested in uh Jasper which was like one of the early kind of chat GPT rapper type of companies where there was like Hey like marketing you know you need to write a blog post you need to write a a description for a product or whatever and so you could use it for writing any kind of marketing copy and they're graph was I'd never seen it was like in 10 months or 11 months they scaled like 50 million in annual recurring Revenue it was like I've never seen anything even remotely close to that it was it brought up a question like is this sustainable is this like what is happening here like this is I just doesn't compute but it definitely broke my frame of what is possible because I'd been working you know in Silicon Valley since you know 2011 11 12 and uh that just that wasn't a thing you you would never see a graph like that what if some companies that got into that like 10ish or uh 10ish million or similar trajectory in 3mon type of businesses yeah so this is I I wanted to kind of give a dis you know sort of a disclaimer about this which is the big question in the investor Community right now is like the the Moes question uh and that that started around the time that g Chad GPT kind of came out and there was these GPT rappers uh sort of this condescending way of looking at a lot of these companies it's like ah if you can create gpg rapper you know in in in a month then you know a lot of other people will create gpg rappers in a month and you're going to be competing on price and the margins uh go down and yes the AR is great but you're but anthropic is capturing or or or openi is capturing most of the are not you you're kind of a you're kind of like a middleman and you're going to have like a hard time having having margins and and I think it's it's totally a valid question um now I think you know mod develop over time uh through uh strategy and Technical Excellence so I mean some of these companies can go down pretty fast and they're examples of that uh right now um but uh but I think if you you know you can have you can start building technical like with repet again this like idea of like pushing a bull up up a hell you know we have this runtime environment we have like this infrastructure we have the deployment we have databases we have all these Integrations I mean it's the only one in the world that is like an end to-end environment to to make software and like to catch up with that it's going to take years right but technical Advantage is also not a long-term moat and so again it's a big question I don't think it's answered yet you know there there's strategic things you could do if you reach scale if the switching costs are high you know that that may be like a way to to to have sustainable modes but but it is definitely a big question you know what's crazy Sean like for the long I I hate using the dword democratize I think that's like such an overused like Silicon Val do it don't do it but this is actually one of those F few examples where like for the longest time uh building a website or a web app like you just literally couldn't and so now you are making the technology that everyone can do it and so what I think is like guys like Shawn and me or People Like Us who have an audience it's like why don't we just why aren't we like constantly launching like companies using this technology because like our ability to get users cuz we just get on the microphone and talk about it that's like actually a competitive Advantage whereas being technical is no longer it's still an advantage but it's not uh as much as before it's like getting customers now is actually the only hard part which is still hard but it's way easier if you're popular yeah so so you know the Playbook uh I would use is like I would go into some inefficient uh Market industry so a deal from from Magic School went into this hugely inefficient um you know industry which is uh which is uh you know schools and education uh and by way by the way another product is synthesis tutor which is which is also going going viral right now and and and and they they they they have also this Revenue ramp that's kind of crazy both Sean and I invested in in that company think all did yeah yeah and for a while they they had like this this thing where like you know they had they had Educators on the payroll and and whatever they replaced all of that with AI now like you know the kids sit in front of the the iPad and they're talking to the AI and like learning really fast and it's much better than the previous product right so B basically like find an industry where you're familiar with and just like build the DD rapper to like automate some of the work there and like you you could do it like a hundred times and one of them will take off yeah it's the era of the idea guy now it's our turn it's our turn to shine right cuz now the limits and the the kind of the value creation is do you understand a problem well enough to know how to take this really powerful magic wand and point it at that problem and be able to make that more efficient and then of course do all of the other hard things go get customers make it sustainable build a good team you know like do all the the normal entrepreneurship stuff but it seems like more than ever having a great idea is the kind of like key unlock to to doing these things because building has become easier and I'll give you kind of my my personal Epiphany that I had while I was doing this so I invested in rep mostly when I just thought you seemed really smart and I saw a growth curve of developers using it and I thought oh cool like I've experienced this problem before like a One-Stop place where I can come in write the code host it all all the all the stuff you talked about like don't have to download Java don't have to do any of that [ __ ] that that appealed to me at the time I think actually in the same way that synthesis like took Ai and actually almost like really like 10x the value prop of the business um I think you guys doing the same so here's my my Quick Pitch which is now that I think of repet as um like basically what Shopify was for creating you know like online stores I think repet is that for creating software so to me you guys are dude eyes just brightened when you Shopify for software so like I'll give you my example I recently celebrated a milestone that was both I was proud of it and really embarrassed also so um a few years ago I started a e-commerce brand and we just crossed 50 million in Revenue like kind of like cumulative lifetime Revenue half of it was like you know this year but but 50 million total and I was like wow like 50 million that's great like that's I had never created a business I had done 50 million in Revenue so that was like a personal Pride point and at the same time uh I was telling it to to to a friend of mine who's not an entrepreneur he's like yeah man I would love to learn how to you know like make websites and like make products manufacturing and I was like oh I don't know how to do any of that like I was I was like this this brand that is on 50 million in revenue for me I don't I just stacked Alibaba times Shopify I've never manufactured a product in my life still don't know how to and I've never made a website that's like you know actually used by customers still don't know how to but I was able to I was able to skip all the work and get to the brand part like do the thing where we created a product that people liked and you know it's a successful company now and I thought wow rep's going to do that for the software space and I was like it used to be that the job was software engineer and now it's going to be software creator it's like I can be a creator of software without being a programmer myself that little shift is a big shift because the way I think about it I don't know how many developers there are I think GitHub has like 100 million or 200 million accounts so I'll just use that like there's 200 million let's say developers you know software engineers in the world um well now there's going to be 200 two billion people that can create software cuz if you got the internet you got your phone you can create software now you can just tell the agent make me an app that does this make a tool that does this and so you 10x the number of people that can create software in the same way that Shopify and Alibaba 10x or more the number of people who could create products and go sell them like hard Goods uh that's how I see what you're doing yeah so so you know even at the start of repet uh uh you know there's our initial seed deck and the deck kind of has this IL musk style like you know master plan plan and it was like we we build a you know we build a platform we grow it and then AI is going to make the thing a lot more accessible because our mission was uh make programming accessible then we updated our mission was uh create a billion programmers and then so the moment that you know you know even gpt3 came out I was like this is this is the thing and I wrote This Thread on Twitter about how AI agents will just change how programmers work this is the deck so 2015 this is I don't even know if open AI was a research lab at that time maybe uh definitely you know there was no chat GPT but this is your master plan deck so we're going to grow by building tools for teachers and students we're going to build a simple Network and AI assisted interface that blurs the distinction between learning and building evolve into a platform where people can learn build explore and host applications like talking about AI back in 2015 in your in your actual pitch deck dude it's also clear how uh code academy was highly influential to you because I remember years ago Sean said everyone tries to learn how to code I used code academy and it was a pretty cool interface and it's very similar to what you're describing you know I at some point I kind of lost hope in in courses um because like you know we have 100 days of code we're telling users that to use our application you need you need to invest 100 days that's kind of crazy like there there isn't any like successful company in the world where you need 100 days to learn it and and so that's when I kind of changed my mindset and I said okay it needs to be chat GPT like it needs to be just a prompt um and we started building that uh earlier this year and and now that's all we're focused on we want to create new programmers you know existing developers great they have a lot of tools but we want to we want to go after the citizen developer right everyone is a developer and I think that's you know that's what what you're talking about you go from like 100 million developers in the world well I think it it overstates the number it's probably more 30 million and then you 10x that and so what what does the world look like when anyone with an idea could could make something and one of my favorite books is uh the sovereign individual the thing I really was excited about is this idea of ideas become wealth and so no longer have the bottleneck of making something that's where we're headed and this is what you're talking about Sean is is like the uh the it's it's the time for idea guy and like maybe that's you know tongue and cheek and like maybe the way to to talk about it in more precise terms is that people who confined these gaps in in markets people who have expertise in certain areas that they can tell that there's in efficiency and they can like create an AI application that can immediately plug that like I saw this video on Twitter the other day it was of a snake that got its head chopped off and it like floated around and bit the T bit like the tail of its own body and then like the body like reacted your employees are they thinking that this they're sort of doing that to themselves where they're like like when you make jokes or like when you're when you like talk like you know like you don't need to hire all these programmers to do all this stuff are they like sitting there with their hands in their pocket like uh like does that mean us you know I I always wanted the company to be super lean and so um for a long time we're like 10 people but but like now we're like 70 people that's still nothing yeah so so I I I'd rather not hire a lot more people because I think that again the efficiency uh for programmers so look citizen developers are going to go from zero to like say 10x but also existing software engineer are going to go from 10x to 100x right and so and so they're going to be become more and more productive the moment we uh we automate all of software engineering I think that's sort of like the moment of AI so I think it's like a little far away and the reason I say this is because once you automate software then the agents can rebuild themselves and you go into this into this Loop of you know increase intelligence every version builds its next version builds its next version and so this is what they call intelligence explosion that would lead to the singularity right so it's like a pretty crazy time when we automate all of software engineering and so I I think I think it's coming I don't know if it's 10 years or 15 years but I think that's the time where the world really radically changes have you met um anybody in kind of the tech industry that blew you away either person personally or maybe read about them maybe met a friend of a friend told you a story cuz I saw a picture of you with Jensen uh you know you've met Paul Graham I know that you're like connected in the AI circles you met Sam Sam Alman in addition to building the tech I love the characters and I love the stories is why every you know Elon snippet of how he runs his companies goes viral and [ __ ] like that what are your favorite kind of inspiring stories or crazy stories that you you've either experienced directly or or red yeah you one of the Curious story when we're um raising from a16z Mark invites me to to breakfast at like 10:00 a.m. at his house and so so I go there and I expect like I'm going to talk about the business and so we we spend like two or three hours talking about politics and the world and like all sorts of things that are interesting to to him and I felt like this guy is like is like more than just a technologist he's like a philosopher and so right now he's he's going out and he's talking about this stuff like his Joe Rogan interview went super viral and he's been always have like these interesting ideas about about the world and the interesting thing about a16z is his partner Ben is is sort of like the executor sort of the executive right he wrote the hard thing about hard things where like he teaches you like about what it means to run a company it's painful it's hard and what it means to hire executiv what it means to scale a company and so so you have this this Duo of like the doer and the like the philosopher uh and I think uh I think that's really amazing and and I think they're they're they have really big plans uh and anded I would just hate the philosopher be like are you gonna do anything what are what are you talking about politics for right now it's got to be the worst to be the doer in the doer philosopher relationship right you know I I think uh I think Sam is is uh it was interesting to to kind of meet him talk to him because he's very effective like he like the first time I met I met him or like maybe not the first time but like he was on his computer as as I'm talking and so I'm talking I was like yeah we're fundraising I went uh to talk to you know a6z I'm like really big fan of of Mark and he was typing in his computer okay I introduce you to Mark um and and and then you know when you send Sam emails it's like pretty quickly replies with with like a you know a couple words like a couple sentences so I saw how effective and fast you can be and that that really I'm I'm not like that you know I'm trying to be more like that but I'm someone who really values the the quietness like to think about ideas and to think about strategy and things like that so I'm not always in top of communication it actually makes me like a little you know it's overwhelming um but but uh but I think I think seeing these people at least you know inspired me to be a little more like that you uh you tweeted out the story that I loved about um you said the most G gster story in Silicon Valley is Steve Jobs buying Pixar for 5 million investing 50 million and operating at a loss for a decade so much so that he had to cut personal checks to make payroll and somehow turning it around to A7 billion doll exit why why did you like that story you know uh I there are people who are overrated in Sil Valley and I think there are people who are underrated like I think people think about Steve Jobs in terms of like yeah the flashy things the iPhone iPod you know coming in stage and and doing that the thing I like about the Steve Jobs story is when he was lost in the desert for 10 years so he left uh he was fired from Apple and then he created two companies that were failing the whole time like next Computing NeXT computers and Pixar were L literally failing like they didn't do anything you they weren't selling he was just like investing more and more of his money uh like I think he was goingon to go broke if but he kept going for 10 years like how do you do that uh and you know I'm a person who like we talked about in my story where I want to be able to go the distance I think Going the Distance is is is an advantage for for entrepreneurs and Pixar became this hugely valuable company uh and it goes from making no Revenue to to making billions of dollars and going public over over a couple years um and next next next computers saved apple apple was having a a problem with OS like Intel you know they had the chip before I don't know they made it internally or something like that and then everyone was moving to Intel and intel was the best Computing chip and they wanted their computers to be fast and so they need a new operating system and they tried to buy they went to the market they triy to acquire company they couldn't find a great operating system and next Computing had the had had a great operating system and that became Mac OS so they they bought I didn't know that I thought next was just a failure I didn't I didn't even realize it actually contri I thought they just bought Steve back Aqua hire but it wasn't an aqua it wasn't just aquire no I mean Objective C for example you know next Computing was really obsessed with this idea of object orani programming and they innovated a lot on what that means and you know it is based on Unix but it has a lot of interesting features on top of that so app they it saved Apple because Apple was otherwise not going to be competitive without the new Chips right well dude I know we kept you half an hour over I apologize for that uh but this was amazing this was one of my favorite episodes in a long time and I'm not just saying that you can go check all the other episodes I don't say that at the end so uh this was awesome thanks so much for coming on uh where should people Twitter is the best place to follow you yeah Twitter uh Amad on Twitter um and and the repet handle on Twitter as well just just RL dude thank you very much you're the best of course uh of course my my pleasure [Music]

so I think the theme of this episode is Rich guys crazy or genius we've got the Bitcoin guy who's doing the treasure hunt and he's either crazy or he's a genius right is he crazy or is he awesome Ralph luren crazy or genius looks like he came down on the side of Genius I have another one for [Music] you dude have you heard about this guy who's doing the $2 million treasure hunt no I have no idea what you're talking about okay well can I interest you in a treasure hunt story yeah $2 million that sounds good to me there's this guy named John Collins black and there's not a lot of info about this guy but he has basically hidden somewhere between two and three million do Across America right now in different Treasure Chest so he's got five treasure chests out there each with a bunch of treasure inside and this specifically it's not just like cash it's things that are valuable so he spent the last five years buying valuable kind of artifacts so one of them has you know rare Pokemon cards a 2002 holographic Charizard card he's got one with George Washington's jelly glass that he bought out of an auction there's things from from old shipwrecks and in total the stuff is worth two to three million dollars he split it between five treasure chest and he's hidden it in physical locations across America and then he released a book that that's called there's a it's called there's a treasure or something like that I buried a treasure there's a treasure yeah and it's basically just Clues to find his treasure and so there's maps and clues and you can buy this book right now and go find this treasure dude wait hold on it's a this is it's even funnier it's on Amazon it's a book on Amazon called there's a treasure inside and the book is $35 so he's going to recoup a little bit of his a little bit of it a little bit of it but probably not as much so he's got like you know a hidden a Colombian green emerald and all all kinds of stuff inside and I find this kind of fascinating so this guy's story is interesting he was like a musician in LA and that didn't really work out and then he was like okay he started creating uh websites for helping people find jobs and that started going good he used that to buy Bitcoin earlier earlyish on and he I guess the story is he's a Bitcoin multi-millionaire who was also fascinated by adventure and so there's this thing called the fen treasure have you ever heard of this okay yeah Fen treasure it's a cache of gold and jewels uh that Forest Fen an art dealer uh hid in the Rocky Mountains yes I actually do think I've heard of this I believe Zach Crockett Zachary Crockett who used to work for me at the hustle wrote a big article where he spent a week trying to find this treasure how did he do I don't think anyone has found it so so five people died trying to find this treasure cuz he it was like is it up in the mountains whatever so they're climbing so five confirmed deaths chasing the treasure then he announces somebody found it I think this was in 2020 is 2022 he says that um somebody found it and then he dies months later it was revealed that former journalist and medical student Jack Stu found it and then he auctioned it off for what uh for a total of $1.3 million of what he found and so this guy John or whatever colins black was searching for that in 2020 and so he was like during covid he had he had searched for the treasure he thought this was really cool and when he when we were all in lockdown he decided I'm going to do one of two things he either was like gonna create a children's book publisher or create a treasure hunt he did both and so he created this he started accumulating assets for this uh treasure hunt I have a friend named chip fory chip forsight is a crazy person I've been friends with him for 10 years his brother is AJ fory who started ick if you remember ick yeah and Chip will go out he's friends with these guys who raise funding to go find shipwrecks that they think have well I guess some of them are valuable just because they're shipwrecks but some of them are valuable because they were like ships that had gold or other like valuable stuff in the in the ship and they raise money to go out and find these shipwrecks and he tells me all about it and it's like the type of story where the people who are into this it's the only drug that fills that need do you know what I mean yes like it's it's like it is an intoxicating thing to find this like romantic there's a romantic idea about a treasure hunt right yeah like it's awesome and so like I understand why it's not my obsession but I understand why it is other people's Obsession the other thing I think is interesting is choosing to release a book for this I feel like there's a missed opportunity I feel like he should have done something with Tik Tok or social media where I feel like there was a more viral way to release the clues or to let people unlock the clues or search for this thing together like a weekly or monthly announcement yeah you know I don't know if you've seen there's these things that go really really viral on Tik Tok it'll be like some woman say telling this 39p part story of how her husband cheated on her and these things just a it's like a true crime they amass like tens of millions of followers that are trying to just follow them they wait for that next piece of the story to drop and I do think that there was a way to do this that somebody could do which would be to let do a bit of a treasure hunt but use use social media use Tik Tok as a way to uncover the clues as they go um and then people go in the real world using those Clues rather than a book Steve Bartlett who's the podcast host of uh what's it called Diary of a CEO before that he had a like a Ad Agency or whatever before that he worked for me back when he was maybe 19 20 years old 21 years old something like that he was just like like a young guy that we had that was like a growth marketer and his job was to come up with great growth ideas one of the things that he did at the time that I remember was he grew his Twitter and Instagram accounts like crazy by doing a very simple thing he was doing these like cash drops where he'd put just 200 bucks in an envelope and he would say at a college town I think it was he'd be like we've dropped it here he would post a video of him hiding it and then there would be videos of people going trying to search for it and they'd be basically they would tweet where hit it um in some way and then they would tweet people going and finding them but I don't remember if it was him that did this or somebody else that was doing this effective strategy that's a great idea it was a great idea and it was like 200 bucks it wasn't even that much money that they were doing and they were doing these mystery cash drops as a way to just generate hype but the genius of it was the content that they created kind of before the drop and then after the drop of people searching it made it feel like a big deal and then they would do the next one and the next one I think it was just an account called like mystery cash drop that was doing this that was working that's getting really big this was like 10 years ago so I'm trying to remember the guy who ran that account messaged me he listens to the pot like it's you never heard of this guy mystery cash drop uh he me was before we even started the podcast this a long time ago no but he still does it like oh yeah it was hidden cash I think that Cas one one of these guys just messaged us you don't remember this and uh what for some reason it came into our world where I I forget what happened someone tagged us on his Twitter thing and he was like I love those guys and then he dm'd me and just said hey something like that so maybe I got this wrong maybe Steve wasn't the guy doing it maybe Steve showed me this and we were going to like copy this strategy I don't remember the link Steve definitely put me onto this because it was happening both in the in San Francisco and also in the UK the account now is suspended for hidden cash which I remember happened back then it got suspended I'm not 100% sure but why but let me just read this article this was back in 2014 so this is literally 10 years ago it says an an benefactor has been leaving cash hidden not across San Francisco inviting strangers to find it via a series of Clues they left money under chairs in public parks in stairways or in public bathrooms and they basically post a picture of them holding the cash and then like a zoomed in thing of where they put it like it's like under a toilet but you don't know which toilet and then they they their quote was I've made millions of dollars the last few years more than I could ever imagine and yet many friends of mine cannot afford to buy a home in the Bay Area this has caused me quite a bit of reflection and I'm determined to give away some of the money I make to charity and and to do fun creative things like this and that uh he or she will leave it once or twice a week did somebody should just do this again this is it would work today I think this is awesome uh I think I'm G to start doing this the the other day the other day it's like a hobby it's like running we just were jogging we're talking about like I think I'll I think I'll pick up this hobby it's like I want to play real life Willy Wonka like I just want to like start I just want to like start controlling people's lives $100 at a time and just seeing like if I can like make all the monkeys dance that's kind of like what this is it's like you're just like want to be a puppeteer $100 at a time a little bit but it is like kind of fun hey guys so a huge part of the growth of this podcast is thanks to our presence on YouTube and without YouTube I don't think we'd be as big as we are now and it's all because of you guys for watching we see you in the comments even the negative ones it definitely bothers me but I read all of them and we see how powerful this platform is for growing an audience well if you're planning for the next year and you're thinking about investing in a YouTube strategy for your business then you have to check out this new guide from HubSpot it covers everything you need so building a Content strategy it covers understanding the YouTube algorithm and how to leverage SEO tactics and then it also talks about the different content types and examples to create engaging content so don't miss out grab the guide and set yourself up for Success next year now let's get back to the episode I think one of the problems is like you get that initial hit of like excitement and attention and everyone loves it and then it's going to fade away and then you're going to keep hiding the cash but you're not going to get that same hit so you're gonna have to it's like an addict you have to do more in order to get that so then you're like um you know it'd be a shame if somebody got hurt finding it but that would make for a whole another news cycle around this and then you sort of EX you just keep escalating the prizes and the D after a while it's like hey Willy Wonka why do you have a chocolate River and invite children over all the time this is just dangerous do you know like at some point it's be like hey could you can we go TCH to dinner and you not like hide $200 while walking into the restaurant the funny thing is we're so old that like everybody who's listening to this that's like under the age of 25 is like yeah you know this is how every YouTuber you know tries to get famous is doing this exact same thing yeah they're like what are you going to do Dex go give like a homeless guy $100 and film yourself like giving him a haircut like that classic stick exactly I think maybe the takeaway is uh you know what's old is new uh for some of these things like the what the hidden cashes guy was doing it's not really all that different than what Mr Beast does and uh has done to great effect all right can I tell you a story about a different way to look at Adventure about someone who's like obsessed over a little bit and I think you know this person you know of them and I think I'll I'll tell you a few facts that kind of like shock you but also I think you're going to be into this person more than before so the story is about a guy named Ralph lifshitz he was a Jewish kid from New York city grew up I believe in the 30s and the story is basically that he wanted to be an actor he grew up poor but he loved like seeing all these movie stars uh on TV and he was like you know I love that you can dress up and pretend to be another person and if you pretend hard enough people kind of start treating you seriously and start treating you like that person and I love that I love that and I also love the idea that you can write a story and make it movie and I can live my life through that lens that that the lens of that movie and it gives me hope so he was like Intoxicated by this but he sucks at acting and so he's like I can't go to Hollywood I can't become an actor however what I can do is I can shape these movies and direct these movies not with a camera but with clothing and so we get super into clothing what kind of leap of faith was that I can shape these movies not through writing or acting but through clothing that's a pretty ridiculous statement No it's not I'll give you an example so he was like he's got this quot where he was like I love how like these actors like I like you could dress up as like a military person and you kind of feel a little bit tougher sometimes or I could dress up like a farmer and like I actually want to go outside and like get dirty a little bit I could dress up like a cowboy and I want to go and like do Cowboy [ __ ] like if you dress up with a suit people kind of take you seriously and I think that's cool that you can like pretend but it kind of like what's the difference between pretending and reality if you do it long enough like it kind of becomes like same thing and so he was like I can't really act but like I can dress up like these characters and I kind of a little bit start actually feeling like these characters and eventually Ralph lift shits he got made fun of a lot because his name even like the Jewish kids were like dude your name has the word [ __ ] in it like that's like like you dork and so he changed his name to Ralph Lauren and so he starts um that is Ralph Lauren the clothing company he starts selling clothes for Brooks Brothers like in their store and then eventually at the the age of 28 he starts uh his own business and he's like my first thing that I'm going to sell is ties he lik ties and he goes and he pitches something like um Bloomingdales and he's like hey can you guys sell my ties and and the guy's like these are great ties I would love to sell them but it has this name Ralph luren on the back of the tie like no one wants that [ __ ] dude like no one knows who you are I don't give a [ __ ] about Ralph Lauren you got to take that off there and he had it kind of a Sylvester Stallone moment where he was like look I'm a nobody but I need my name to be on these ties like this is this a deal breaker and bloing Dales is like all right well no we're not going to do this deal and So eventually he keeps on hustling and he gets his ties into like Macy's or something like that in the first year of business he does like half a million dollars in Revenue which is a home run uh he did this in the 60s that's the equivalent of like three and a half million dollars today home run after year three or four he starts coming up with different ideas and he comes up with this idea of Polo so the polo brand the college shirt that used to everywhere and he parlay by the way what's what's the backstory of that what was his inso do you know for the shirt like the inso was basically like I said he grew up as this poor Jewish kid in New York but what he loved was this idea of like class and old money uh this idea of like was even though he's not a was he like loved the idea of like sophistication and to to him the sport of Polo that like screamed like both utility because it's a sport but also like sophistication because it's like supposed to be like a rich people who play it and the collar that Polo players wear they would always wear a collar and in particular they would button down the collar so an Oxford button- down cloth shirt that's comes from the the sport of Polo and so do like certain style boots certain style pants and so there was a little bit where it was like already considered like a fashionable Sport and so he says like I'm gonna name my brand Polo and so he builds Polo and this [ __ ] over like the course of a handful of years it takes off so now Ralph luren he's worth something like $10 billion he still owns I think 80% of the company and he's a great businessman but that's not what I actually am impressed by him what I'm impressed by him is two things the first he has this idea of like you are the director of your own life and your life is basically a movie and he has this idea where he was like I would wear clothes that would I almost I think Tony Robbins said this or you told me that Tony Robbins said this where he was like if I want to act tough or confident I make my body tough or confident so what do you call that thing where you like like flexing power posing where you like flex your chest when you're not feeling comfortable and you put your body into like a confident position and your brain kind of follows your body he sort of is saying the same thing but with clothing where he was like you know if I wanted to feel a little bit more sophisticated than I actually felt at the moment I would dress a certain way and like my brain would follow and I find that to be like a really cool idea and the the second thing that he did that was really interesting is I don't know if you remember this because we were kids but do you remember Ralph Lauren advertisements do do you remember any of those like the photos and magazines no what was it what was interesting is that what he would do is he would he had he used a lot of the same models and the models oftentimes were not professional models but what he would do is if he wanted to like he would set the stage so basically he would act like he's filming an entire movie and so they would rent a home in the Hamptons let's say it's like uh the ad is for some type of summer summer wear for the beach he would rent to Hampton's house and he would be like well if I'm a like a wealthy family in the Hamptons who has this like beautiful home like how what would you guys be doing right now like maybe you'd be playing football maybe you'd all be sitting on uh in the parents' bed in the morning as if like the kids just like woke you up but he would create these like elaborate sets where he would like make you live like you in a movie on set and so he's like we're going to all like pretend that this is like real and they would do this whole elaborate thing just for a handful of photos but if you look at a lot of the ads they're really like indepth and it made me start thinking a lot about like with startups and what you and I do we sometimes are just reactive to like to like whatever like customers are saying not more so like how do we set the stage for what what do we want the world to be and I think Amazon used to do this small thing where they're like before we launch any product I want you to write the press release like tell me what do you want a customer to feel about this or how do you want this to be described when it's all said and done right and because the internet has such a low barrier entry and it's really easy to adapt and change things rarely do we sort of think ahead and like this is like my vision for the world and at least everyone in my small world how I want them to feel how I want my customers to think how I want them to uh appreciate us I do think there's something cool about I'm looking up vintage Ralph luren ads and I see what you're saying which is like a really heavy lean into yeah like true lifestyle shoots rather than Studio or sort of framed um you know just like let's go here let's get this single shot you in front of the water boom yeah let Turn and Burn it's like well this is somebody's house in the Hamptons wearing these clothes doing what they do with all of the little you know family photos in the background and whatnot like it's it looks a lot more authentic and this is one of those things that's interesting because as a business person it never pencils out on a spreadsheet to do this right like up up front there is no way to sit here and justify this but then there's things in your gut and there's the the people who do who actually do make the BET and do pull it off and then in retrospect it sounds obvious you know I'll give you an example there is a brand um uh e-commerce brand and they were talking about influencers it was like well what's the what's they're talking about an influencer campaign they were going to spend a million dollar on an influencer campaign with these Instagram moms I said what's the return on ads spend of that you put a million dollars in how much you going to get back directly and they're like uh it might be you know 50% meaning we might put a dollar we might get 50 c back uh that's not the way to do it what's your face what's your Facebook ads return on ad spent and and they're like it's like you know a140 put a dollar in get a140 out like why are you spending a million dollars on these influencers and uh are you are you able to measure the halo effect I'm like using all this jargon and he goes uh hey does your wife like does she follow like any of these people and I show my wife and she's like yeah all of these people he goes ask him like a couple of questions about these people like hey do you know like how many kids they have what's their names what products do they use what's the last product you bought that you heard them mention and like my wife could just rattle these from memory and my wife's memory is like I could you know we watch all of Game of Thrones if I asked her today what's a Lannister she'd have no idea she thinks it's part of a staircase and so I'm like she's knows exactly what's going on with these influencers and he goes That's we're spending a million dollars with influencers and um I was like okay you know there's these things that if the result is not easy to measure but it is true right it's got to be both it's got to be actually actually work and not be easy to measure those things are usually pretty uh mispriced meaning that not as many people are willing to do them because most of us want the safety and comfort of things that are proven measurable and I can spreadsheet my way to conviction well it's basically all rooted in can I just justify this if I'm about to get fired yeah or just even my own self-doubt right even like my companies I'm not always thinking I'm going to get fired who's gonna fire me I own the company but I don't want to be an idiot and I don't want to lose and I don't want to fail and I don't want to lose money and it takes courage to make bets and courage is easier when you can when you when the logic when you can logic your way there when you can spreadsheet your way there do you do any of these courageous bets that are nons spreadsheet because I think you I think part of the reason you idolized these is that you didn't typically do those I didn't typically do that and I and I still struggle with it but I have to like when I watch some of these things like uh we talked about Martha Stewart recently now we're talking about raap Lauren like when you talk like and when you talk about some of these like culture changing brands or companies or people are us internet or startup e people there's like we think we are above the fold where we're like logical and we are like well it's easy you put this much money in you get this much money out like why would anyone do anything otherwise but then there's one step above that which is it's the right thing because it's the right thing like right you know what I mean like it's like it's um like uh you know I can't measure this thing but like I know it's awesome right do it because it's awesome yeah and so there's like we try to act like we are some like savante internet nerds where it's like the math says X Y and Z but there's always there's one above that which is yeah but it's it just makes sense and so and Peter teal who's like the savonus of savants has said like there's this fifth tent pole of this equation which is called brand and he goes I don't understand brand though uh but like I know it exists but I don't understand it and that's what we're talking about here which is like it just feels right yeah yeah exactly so so long story short I don't do this but I I respect it and I know that it's necessary and I want to do more of it are you doing any of it with Hampton like is there one you could think of that you do yeah like we have we own this podcast called MoneyWise and like it like the only way that we think that it returns an Roi is if someone joins and they said they heard about it through us but that's not that's like the low end of the totem pole of like is it easily trackable right um but then no no like I don't do enough but I I do need to do certain things like this the the the problem with this is you get caught in the day-to-day and you also get caught in the bills and there's also a lot of stories of Ralph Lauren where like he almost lost the company many many many times where he like just didn't pay attention and in one you need a Visionary who doesn't pay attention to the profit because sometimes the [ __ ] that makes the most profit doesn't make sense right off the bat right so I think the theme of this episode is Rich guys crazy or genius we've got the Bitcoin guy who's doing the treasure hunt and he's either crazy or he's a genius right is he crazy or is he awesome Ralph luren crazy or genius looks like he came down on the side of Genius I have another one for you all right and it's Michael sailor have you seen what Michael sailor is currently doing with the market and and Bitcoin and his stock I don't understand it exactly but I understand that he's always up to something uh like like I I always I know that he's like the Barry Bonds of business where like there's always an asteris next to everything he does yeah that's a good explanation um okay so can I explain what's going on micro strategy is a software company they sell uh sof you know at the time they were selling software products and the software business might make like 75 million a year of profit it was like a small cap stock it had been doing great for like ever like it was a great like he'd been Rich for a long time right yeah the the business had been he I think he's the longest 10ed CEO of a public company mean he's been the CEO of this company for like 24 plus years or something like that and um but the stock had been flat if you look go if you just zoom out on the chart it looks like a very flat line and when he came on the podcast it was because at the time he was doing something very interesting he had taken his company's cash reserves like their treasury which normally you either keep in cash maybe treasury bills or you use it to buy back the stock and instead he used it to buy Bitcoin so basically micro strategy was a software company the software company had hundreds of millions of dollars in their bank account which they're supposed to just hold in case they need it and his plan was I'm going to invest that money in Bitcoin yeah we're going to switch our treasury strategy to being Bitcoin so September 14th 2020 bitcoin's priced at $10,000 a coin and he buys $175 Million worth of it and then a month later or so he buys another $250 million of it which looking back at it that sounds great yeah at $10,000 $111,000 a coin and he has since been buying uh more and more Bitcoin he now holds $ 37 billion of Bitcoin micro strategy mic strategy does he himself also I think personally owns like hundreds of millions if not a billion dollars of Bitcoin wow they are up $15 billion under their Bitcoin position in four years so he's generated for 15 billion dollar of value doing this strategy so it starts out by saying I'm going to convert my you know step one convert our company's idle cash into Bitcoin okay did that but now the company doesn't generate and the idea was every year when we generate more few cash flow we're going to do the same we're going to you know we make million bucks we're going to buy more but over time he starts doing more aggressive bets so what he starts doing is he starts issuing these convertible bonds and now so he goes to the market he says hey uh our here's a corporate bond you can buy the bond we're going to take the proceeds from the bond sale and we're going to go buy Bitcoin and he does that over and over and over again and on top of that if you look at micro strategy stock today so when he was last on the podcast well let's just actually say this in March of 20 the stock was $10 in March of 21 the stock was $78 and today it's $410 correct and it is so it's up in the Last 5 Years by 2600% okay so it's shot up it's uh if you compare it to even Nvidia stock this year it's outperformed Nvidia which is pretty insane and so what is going on here um this you know his company is now worth 80 billion do as of you know as of today and how much Vue and profit does the actual business the actual software business is declining 10% a year and is something like a couple hundred million in revenue and under a 100 million of net income so it is a rounding error it is not it is no longer relevant to the stock price and does he have employees who like work there yeah they still have employees that just keep running that software business but the stated strategy is her job is to uh acquire Bitcoin in the most effective ways possible and hold forever that's what he want to do that's a influ uh that's a that's a like an inspiring um talk every Friday at your all heads right like that's a bitcoin price is up great job everybody we did our job and uh you know to his credit he's been buying throughout all the dips so like you know bitcoin price went up to 60,000 then it goes down to 16,000 and even during that process you know Bitcoin in December 2022 Bitcoin price is 177,000 he buys another 50 million he buys another 14 million he buys another 150 million he has continued to buy throughout the whole process and bitcoin's at an all-time high and uh as of today he just bought another 5.4 billion dollars of Bitcoin at the uh you know sort of all-time high prices how did he have the money to do that again he's raising money in these bonds and so there's here okay so what's interesting about this here's what I want to talk about is genius or crazy I guess like I hesitated to even bring this up because a this is outside of my zone of competence meaning like I don't know corporate bond strategies I don't know why um I don't know how options Traders look at this I don't know what the bond market is like that is not something that I've spent 20 years of my career in I'm a startup guy okay so on one hand unqualified to talk about this on the other hand I've been a crypto holder and believer since far before M Michael sailor and have seen throughout each cycle how new players come in with new strategies and build you know massive profiles and success on the upswing and I've seen things go very very badly um you know last cycle there was Z bankman freed with FTX there was dquan there was three Aros Capital there were several people that for a moment in time looked like absolute Geniuses they were hailed by everybody they were on the cover of magazines you know Sequoia investing in in FTX and everything looks incredible and uh then it all comes Crashing Down either due to bad acting or bad risk management I don't know anything about crypto and I can give you an example of a red flag that was on air on our podcast so I don't remember exactly I think it was 30 or 45 minutes in I asked him a question I go so Michael you're buying all this Bitcoin with your company's money cool what are the downsides um because like it's appears as though like one of the downsides could potentially be your losing focus on your main money-making software um but and I think you think that's worth it but what are some other downsides and his answer was there are no downsides and I was like well I mean like every decision has a downside like the downside of being healthy is that you have to go to bed early when you want to go and hang out with your friends like but it's worth it like there there are downsides and he kept insisting there are no downsides and in my head I thought if you can't be honest to me about this like pretty straightforward thing are is there anything else that you're being dishonest about yeah there are no downsides said every charlatan ever right that is a it is can be red flag that doesn't mean it's damning no let me it does not mean it's damning but it was a red flag let me give you the generous interpretation of this so I actually agree with Michael sailor in one weird way when he said there's no downsides which is that for him personally there were really no downsides at the time at that time that if you go back and you listen carefully to Michael sailor's interviews most of the interviews he just talks about how he had the Epiphany and he realized that Bitcoin is the way and he started doing it the true story is that there's one like precursor to that Epiphany which was that he was stuck between a rock and a hard place he had this software business that was successful it was profitable and I think at the time it was even you know had shown growth or had been showing growth over the last 10 years and he was getting zero Credit in the stock market for it and he's like what am I supposed to do like we're a successful company we've been operating successfully for you know 15 plus years and the market is basically saying give us back the cash we don't we will not value you for any of the cash you have on hand you should just give it back to us we were going to give you no stock credit for how you might invest it how you might use that cash how you might grow your business we're going to give you zero credit for it and so he had this problem which was no matter what he did with his company at the time he couldn't get the stock price to go up he couldn't increase shareholder value and so he had in some ways nothing to lose because he was stuck and he had been stuck in this Plateau for so long and the market he had said he says some interviews like the market was giving me a very clear message we don't believe that you can invest this cash in any way that's going to grow your business well then he's like well screw that why don't I just do something else with it if I can't grow micro strategy with it maybe I can grow it through investment and he went and he looked at real estate he looked at Gold he looked at all the different ways that he could do it and he basically at that point deduced that Bitcoin was his best bet to invest the money to actually grow the stock and was he like a crypto guy so 2020 for a lot of the hardcores was late in the game for crypto was he like he was he was skeptical he he did not believe in Bitcoin somebody had told him about it he didn't believe so he wasn't one of these like early ha he went watched a bunch of Pomp's interviews and he started reading about it he started learning about it the other thing that was true was that he looked at the amount of uh inflation and he realized that the kind of stated goal of two or 3% inflation was misleading that it didn't count a bunch of other things it also didn't take into account the fact that if you were an investor you just put the money in the S&P 500 it was growing at you know 10 15% a year and he was like look if I can't beat that there's really no reason to invest in my company if I don't have the ability to beat that rate and so what he wanted to do was you know like most Bitcoin maximalists they just at the end of the day they look at fiat currency and they believe that here you have a um a weak currency and if you can ever if you could borrow a weak currency at 0% interest rate and use it to buy a hard currency like Bitcoin that's a good trade so that's the the two things that he wanted to do was he wanted to get out of Fiat because he didn't like the direction that Fiat was going with inflation and um and secondly he knew his stock was stuck okay so that was that part back then but at that time he wasn't doing this thing where he's borrowing billions of dollars to buy Bitcoin and so let me just like kind of walk you through the model of what he's doing now okay so basically micro strategy issues debt they use that that convertible Bond corporate bond and so that like today they just did A5 billion whatever corporate bond offer they raise it from uh Bond buyers the bond market so there's trillions of dollars that get invested in bonds and one of the things you know you might say why does why do why are people buying a micro strategy bond is it because of the underlying business and it was versus just buying Bitcoin themselves or just buy Bitcoin themselves the re the Arbitrage is that he realized there's you know a trillion dollar Plus Market of people of people who buy bonds that because of their structure they're not allowed to buy security so they can't buy buy stocks they can't buy real estate they can't buy uh Bitcoin directly they can't buy the Bitcoin ETF so the bond market cannot access Bitcoin unless they access it through a bond got it that's interesting the Mandate of those funds is that they can only buy bonds that's why people gave them the money was you're going to buy bonds it's a 0% uh interest rate but it can you can convert the bond into micr strategy stock at a certain price at 300400500 $600 a share higher than the current price of the thing so it's like a long longterm call option on micro strategy okay so if you were in the bond market and you wanted access to bitcoin but your bylaws and your mandate does not allow you to buy Bitcoin directly then crazy loophole that's a crazy loophole Supply demand so he's the only Supply on the market to absorb this this demand that's there to to get access to bitcoin type of yield by by issuing these these things okay so that's the first part so then he buys Bitcoin and he goes and he tells the whole Market I'm I'm a forever buyer of Bitcoin I will increase increasingly be buying billions and billions of dollars of Bitcoin I'm doing it at the market price and I will continue doing that that instills a bunch of confidence in the Bitcoin Market because Bitcoin says wow there's this whale who says I don't give a damn I'm doing this I'm deep pocketed and I'm gonna keep doing this and so he takes Supply off the market he signals to the market that I'm a forever holder and he says I'm going to keep buying bigger and bigger amounts as we go so the Bitcoin price goes up so now bitcoin price goes up which then causes his stock to go up because his stock is based on the fact that they have $30 billion of Bitcoin sitting there and the stock goes up and then he sells more Equity at a premium and he buys even more Bitcoin now he's selling sh Equity shares to buy Bitcoin rinse and repeat is he selling any of his equity in the company um I don't know I'm not sure and is he liable for any of these uh convertible bonds or these bonds no it's not like a personal guarantee no it's a corporate bond if this goes south and this collapses then his you know net worth which is highly based on his Holdings of micro strategy are going to go down right and his reputation and everything else and what's his net worth now how much of micro strategy does he own he owns 99.9% of micro strategy so as of today just off micro strategy he's worth uh $8 billion okay in 2020 the company was worth 1.4 billion so he was worth am measly $140 million so he's grown from $140 million net worth assuming that is his only money money which it probably isn't all the way up to close to 10 billion so it definitely had asymmetric upside versus downside for him right like uh hitching his wagon to the Bitcoin rocket ship represented a way for him to like you know go explode up in a good way in a way that he was never going to be able to do with just micro strategy the declining software business at the same time you know there obviously is reputational risk and there's Capital risk now okay so how is it going they've basically acquired almost 400,000 Bitcoin um they've outperformed every company in the SP 500 and last week alone it saw $1 136 billion dollar of trading volume to put that in perspective even GameStop during the GameStop GameStop never saw this so he's basically created he's intentionally turned him turned micro strategy into a mem stock meaning he's detached it from the underlying business in the way that GameStop did and and created a product that the option Traders want that the bond Traders want that the Bitcoin maximalists want that the Bitcoin Skeptics hate and want to go short now what what could go wrong let's go to let's go to there um and by the way let's also say the craziness of not only doing this but then spending the last four years just on tour being a Bitcoin evangelist is also like a really extreme step to take right like there were no half measures in what he did this is a you know sort of Elon Musk style Allin reputationally Allin financially Allin and he has that personal he's got the typ I don't know him other than the 60 minutes we spent virtually with him but he seemed like he had the personality where he's super high IQ super low like emotional normal human emotions where he's like right but it makes sense the math says this therefore I do that even if that is a ridiculous thing to most people's standards high IQ High T count yeah yeah like he he ponies up okay so now what's the you know at the same time maybe I'm just uh like a a pts Deed from past crypto Cycles but like I mentioned every crypto cycle this happens somebody gets Uber aggressive they're seen as a genius they overextend or they commit malpractice and they come crashing down when the cycle you know inevitably these things are all cyclical when it goes down last cycle it was FTX it was dquan it was three Eros Capital these were multi-billion dollar vehicles were created very quickly they they burned bright and then they fizzled out um due to one of those two reasons so I'm on the lookout right now bitcoin's at an all-time high instead of just Jubilation I'm just keeping an eye out you know fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me type of thing so I'm just keeping an eye on what might what might it be the cycle on the other side he's made a couple of Genius calls so back in I want to say when was it 2007 is time frame there's a bunch of interviews of Michael sailor talking about Apple maybe 2012 and he basically talking about he he's on a thing and he's like Apple's going to go to $2,000 a share and he's like you don't understand what's happening apple is in and he the same way that he's talking about Bitcoin how Bitcoin is this you know the greatest invention ever how it's going to be millions of dollars of coin he was talking about Apple the same way he's like you have a super supercomputer in your pocket do you understand what this means you know you know that four billion people are going to be carrying this thing around and that Apple's going to be making X all the numbers just sounded insane to people at the time and when he was talking about it and it's all come true like his his entire bed on Apple he's like he's like I don't know why you would own any stock besides apple and like if you had listened to Michael seller at that time always he's always had this like you all are stupid this is obvious and he's right sometimes yeah I mean I don't know these are over over simplifications but yeah like I guess the guy's fascinating he is a fascinating guy I think you described him well with he's extremely high IQ he's extremely high hes and when he gets conviction on something he sounds insane and so okay you know I think the the main thing is uh where does this go wrong so I think the way M place it goes wrong obviously if bitcoin's price starts to crash the problem will be if for whatever reason micro strategy stock which today trades at like a two and a half times multiple of nav you know nav is the net asset value so like the the underlying asset that it holds right it owns $33 billion of Bitcoin so the question is why is it a $83 billion company which is what you think it should be it should if you own it should be like a $35 billion company it should be it should be whatever the asset is plus like the multiple of profit for software it's a Bitcoin holding and acquisition company and so maybe you say okay here's its Holdings great and then on top of that maybe there's some premium for the fact that it's able to acquire them on Leverage it could do things that a Bitcoin ETF can't right so a Bitcoin ETF can issue a bond it is different but the question is is 2 and 12x the right multiple yeah that's crazy the question is the down spiral looks like this the UN looks like this which is micro strategy for whatever reason either because Bitcoin price goes down or the stock market just changes its tune on it starts to not trade at such a premium to the nav and now all this money that it's borrowed these bonds expire 2027 2028 2029 if those were to convert he would be forced into selling Bitcoin and once he becomes a forced seller now the whole Market the whole Bitcoin Market will start to crash because it'll say oh my God micro strategy is gonna have to unwind its entire Bitcoin position that's going to be $35 billion or more of Bitcoin hitting the market how much is Bitcoin worth like how much what percentage uh of a player is he he owns about 1% of the Bitcoin float today and he's trying to get you know 2% basically dude this guy's intense yeah this gu I I guess my short story is I don't know what's gonna happen I I guess my disclaimer is this I do not know what's going to happen more than that I'm a a novice when it comes to this however I've been in a few crypto Cycles before and I've seen in every every single crypto cycle when crypto goes up somebody starts being very aggressive acquiring uh buying bit buying crypto using leverage like he's doing right now it hasn't ended well in previous cycles and right now everybody is calling this the infinite money glitch you go on YouTube you search micro strategy infinite money glitch he's a God he's the best and it always makes you wonder what is the scenario where this unravels and do I believe that that could come true here there is no strategy that is risk-free there is no free lunch and I think that right now the entire narrative is about how this is a free lunch how this is a free money glitch and I don't believe that I don't know enough to know the specifics about this but my spidey sense is tingling who's the um the most conservative Bitcoin per so uh conservative being um like they're rational and they could explain the pros and the cons without being overly emotional who who's that in the coin world so that's a good question who do I trust the most to have a rational opinion about Bitcoin a great question yeah who could so there's there's this a guy like Andreas Antonopoulos who I believe is that but he's a technologist so you don't you you listen to him about how Bitcoin as a technology um has uh has great potential so you know you read his book which is called um the internet of money and he's extremely rational and he's a good faith actor who's who's the person that's like you know if we all buy into this and if it works you know the upside is this but if we don't the downside is this and this is and like who just says like like here's all the potential I think a lot of people say that I think a lot of people understand this like a lot of people say like look Bitcoin has these properties it could become X it could become the next gold actually most people fall into the bucket of they don't price that as 100% certainty right they say it's possible and there's a potential for that that's why I own some of it but I don't put my entire net worth in it and it is also possible that it doesn't doesn't get adopted or that there's a technical flaw or that governments beat it down in these ways or that it becomes uh unpopular for these reasons and that's the risk in this right like this that feel that those vocal thought leader rationalists what do they say about Michael sailor they don't take a position like right now even as I'm saying this I'm thinking to myself yeah I'm going to go cut this and post because why take a position what's the upside the the upside is I might be right a few years from now you're going to look good by like predicting things um and there's also the upside of like just doing what's right and telling everyone don't waste your [ __ ] money on this thing yeah but I guess it's uh you have to be a smart enough to understand it B you have to have the desire to like look right by putting your neck on the line with a prediction yeah the Bitcoin community Community has doesn't seem like it typically has the like the moral fiber no no I wasn't going to say that I was going to say uh they don't mind expressing they don't they're very vocal they you know if someone thinks you're full of it they also very Wishful about their bags right that's I think that's goes back to your question of who could you trust to not speak just hopefully about their bag right they just they want it to be true so much that they convince themselves it's true and risk free what I'm trying to get at is who's the person who I can trust to find out what the opinion uh of Michael sailor is I have searched long and hard because before this podcast I did research to say can and I literally tweeted this out so if you think I'm an idiot I I I also think I'm an idiot my tweet today was can someone with a better brain than me explain what sailor is doing a no strategies is without risk what are the risk what is the math if Bitcoin drops to X dollars it becomes a problem and B why is the stock trading at such a premium to nav that post has you know maybe 100 plus replies I read every single one of them I read other threads that people have put out about this if there was one great explanation I would have just pointed you to it and I would have read it out loud I have not found one myself that doesn't mean it doesn't exist I have not found one myself that I can read and I could say oh in simple terms I understand why he's doing this why it's working today what the risks are how it would unravel if it unraveled I'm only recently at the age where I don't trust everyone uh like like like up until recently like my logic was constantly like well the institutions are buying into this therefore it must be safe or like you know like whoever's raising the money for this guy like surely they know what they're talking about so now I'm I I've just two years ago got to the age where it's like you know they're flawed humans just like me and so I don't know who to trust with any with these types of situations because I'm so uneducated on the topic but I have uh my spidey sense is tingling I wouldn't I with my own money I wouldn't touch any of this yeah yeah I would say I have I have no proof uh other than it just it doesn't feel good do you know what the uh I think I think the Supreme Court or someone like that like defined pornography at like they said like you know when you see it it's hard to they're like it's hard to Define but you know it when you see it you know what's the difference between pornography and like nudity in a National Geographic TV show you know it when you see it I don't exactly know it when I see it in this situation with him but I know that something doesn't feel right and I can't explain why okay so here here's my commitment um I brought this up today Half Baked and I admit that um I'm going to go and try to find the smartest people I can to explain this to me until I am satisfied with a simple explanation of what's going on and then I'll share that if I leave this in I'm saying that as a bookmark to say let's hold opinions till part two I might just take this whole part out because I'm uncomfortable with the uh level of half informed speculation that was in the section uh I think it's interesting I think it's interesting but you know that like shockingly people look to you for like this like you are so like I asked you that question uh of like who's rational that people look to there are many people who would say Sean I am rational but you had two criteria who's rational and intelligent second one that I fall a little short on in terms of these things right and I think I think that you V like VOC like like I'm still working through this problem uh I think that's actually quite valuable yeah I guess I'm just like only 10% of the way working through it and I'm just thinking maybe I should have gone to 50% before coming on the pot and talking about it but I will say this a lot of bit a lot of the uh people have done well with Bitcoin and the people who understand Bitcoin it is the midwit meme like they they look at Bitcoin and they look at all the information and then they reduce it down into a very simple way of looking at things and the you know the way simple way of looking at things which is either um this is uh it's a better version of gold and so it'll be you know it's a it's a tech Improvement on gold um there's people who reduce it down and basically just say uh would I rather have would I rather have hard money or soft money meaning would I rather save wealth in a would rather store wealth in a currency that can't inflate mathematically or a currency that will inflate and if you just Whittle things down like that to a level of Simplicity you can be right without even knowing all the details and so I think one of the challenges with your question of who are the smart intelligent people is that the smartest most rational people I know about Bitcoin a long time ago you know eight years ago told me a very simple thing bought it put it in cold cold storage and moved on with their life um and they don't follow all the twists and turns and they don't try to hop on the next way in the next Trend they don't do crazy options trading or 100x leverage they don't do any of those things and they made a simple opinion based on a very simple assessment um and they' proven to be right and not over complicating it this has been the signal of who's actually intelligent about this versus somebody who's every day on the news has an opinion on every single thing is trying to outsmart everybody those tend to not be the people that I actually you know trust their opinion on this stuff have you seen that show love on the Spectrum yeah I have actually a show about autistic people dating right yeah and there's this one episode where these two guys dating this girl and he was like do you like tacos and she goes yeah I like chicken and cheese and he was like I don't have anything else to say but I want to let you know I'm having a good time and I want to normalize that on in both dating and on this podcast which is um and that's sort of how I feel right now which is I don't have anything else to say but I want to let you know I really enjoy this topic that's it that's the that's [Music] the e

the most important thing in life is how long does something take to double if you look at someone like Warren Buffett he started his compounding Journey when he was 7 years he's going to be 94 this year that's a 87e Runway so far the thing is that if you have a really long Runway then a low rate of compounding would still get you a big number or if you have a shorter Runway and a higher rate would again get you the same result it's very important in life to start that engine early but

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
you've had a good quarter HubSpot stock I think hit an all-time high you sold a domain to open AI you came with a pod you know I don't care what they say about you dmes you're doing okay I'm doing okay I'm doing okay uh thank you okay it's my first million how do we use the hour so that it's your first million if all you do is spend 100% of your time converting your labor into value and do not increase your leverage you're not going to get anywhere okay so what were the things you invest in that had maybe the highest return for you that did actually make you more High leverage never in my mind has it been easier to get to that first million than right now there was no good way to squeeze this and but I can't not say it I'm going to I know I'm going to Reg [Music] okay let's start with opening remarks the first is what I'll call an unhidden agenda and my unhidden agenda so I have a picture of vend diagram I love vend diagrams Circle number one I want to talk about things that I think I have useful things to say in some expertise uh so we'll definitely talk about Ai and agents and things like that but the other circle is things that I think are borderline guaranteed to increase the probability of you the audience making your first million thing number two is that in order to do that uh you know we have at HubSpot we have a culture of uh humility that's one of the core five values at HubSpot and I said this particular line uh to employees at HubSpot I don't think I've ever said it outside of HubSpot but I'm going to uh solve for utility over humility so if there's a way to say something that's going to be more useful as a result of and but in order to do that I'm going to have to say something that's non-h humble I'm going to go and say it even though it's non- humble because it increases the utility of it and there will be a couple of moments um that are completely non-utility and non-h humble as well so that's uh a couple of twist in there okay so we have to start with this which is you're coming on as a guest but you're coming on as the most prepared guest we've ever had we did a preall we discussed a bunch of things then you uh then I sent you some notes and I try to make it light I'm like just maybe one or two things to think about before the episode because I never know how much work somebody wants to put in you then send back a whole another doc that's like hey here's a bunch of stories ideas I have some opening remarks you have a whole bunch of stuff there you went back and you watched your old episodes which are some of the most popular episodes we've had you read all the comments you Incorporated the feedback is this just how you do everything not not everything um so confession on this particular in this particular case not only did I watch my prior episodes read through the comments but in the process of that I saw the leaderboard on my first million YouTube channel and I'm number five and you don't know this about me yet but you will it's like I've never met a leaderboard that I didn't want to get on the top of right it's like okay what what happened here by the way Sam that's what when we I was like so are you coming on what do you want to talk about AI That's obviously an area you know a lot about and he was like yes but through the frame of okay it's my first million that's the name of the podcast how do we use the hour so that you it's it's your first milon so if you're listening to this that I he's like I can't guarantee you're going to do it but I can increase whatever that probability was can I in one hour tell you things that will increase your probability that's a promise to make someone in the YouTube comments on a recent episode we had someone on and Sean and I both sat like this for like eight minutes and uh someone was like dude Sean and Sam are just flirting they're just stared they're at awe I have a feeling we're going to be getting a lot of a lot of these yeah I'm get my hands ready all right so where should we start dsh so let's and I'm not going to give you an auto by Al what I'm going to do though is I'm going to take us back in time a little bit because in order to kind of understand some of the lessons that I thought now in hindsight were sort of the most valuable for me I didn't know this at the time I was living it because we often can't pick that up but I think will be useful so I'm going to go back to where I first immigrated the US I was in my early 20s um and I was here just on a a visit to my parents who were living there I was in Indiana and applied for a job at Pizza Hut rejected applied for a job at Big Lots rejected applied for a job at Red Roof in and because I was Indian and my parents were actually running like they automatically assumed that I like I I'd known things I'd like only been in the country for like three and a half days Indians are are famous not hoteliers but like Motel years yes motel and that's exactly what we had we had a motel like yes um and it was not even like a franchise Motel it was one of those anyway um and so this was for the night shift right so that might be partly why I got it so it's like 11:00 p.m. to 7:00 a.m. and that's the only thing that would work for me because I was taking classes uh during the day and uh so a couple things out of that particular experience and this I think will relate for a lot of folks so in the early parts of most people's career um you're working retail you're working some sort of job um and you have a what I call your currency and your currency is what's the kind of time value of your time it's like oh you're making $365 an hour which is what I was making the kind of early early periods um and you're taking that kind of currency value multiplying it by how much time you how much labor you expend how much time you spend doing whatever it is that people are paying you money for and that's pretty much the production value that's how you create you know create some money in the in those early years so mathematically in that particular equation there's only two ways to make more money one is work more hours and the other one is to raise the currency raise the price that people are willing to pay for your time okay great and that time I was looking for all the hours I could get it's like I I want to work more hours and if someone cancels someone like I will be there just give me the hours like put me in coach um can't believe I made a sports reference I don't do sportsball but anyway um it worked so so here's sort of the kind of the lessons like you start there and you're going to end up spending a large part of the early part of your life let's so call it the first half converting time into money in various shapes and flavors that's effectively what you're going to be doing and then you're going to spend the latter half of your life approximately desperately trying to convert money back into time that's that's what happens that's that's life um and so we go back to the Y I'm converting time into money expending the currency there's going to be um this automatic increase that happens in your currency simply as a result of tenure as it turns out companies pay more for experience than they were so even if you're the same job doing roughly the same thing you're going to get some marginal increase not much but it's going to go up now my argument here is that in order to really kind of break into like you're going to start to have to kind of acrew money if you're in debt you're going to have to get out of that first um but you're going to need to get some sort of Leverage leverage says okay what can I then not leverage in the kind leverage buyout but leverage in the kind of Archy sense uh the guy quote Ares quote is the give me a lever long enough and a full chome out which to place it and I will move the world or I shall move the world and it what's interesting about that that quote particularly and that's a physics thing I love uh math and physics e things is that okay so that full is actually very very necessary you need a point on which the the lever is going to Pivot um and the degree of kind of amplification you get for your Force that's what leverage creates is how far you are from the fulcrum so the kind of the lesson is as you're spending your time if all you do is spend 100% of your time converting your labor into value and do not increase your leverage you're not going to get anywhere so what you have to do is you have to allocate some percentage of your time to say even though someone's not paying for this particular time I'm going to go read a book I'm going to go do this I'm going to do a seminar I'm going to meet a friend whatever it happens to be you have to kind of make that investment you have to carve it out otherwise you never get the leverage necessary in order to make it that first million that's like the number one lesson and the thing that I did that was uh very very useful that I still carry to this day is that you sort of have to carve out literally some amount of uh dollars for yourself and time and money are equal to me back then it's like and what I mean by that is like I'm to take 10% of all the money that's coming in right now I'm going to spend it on books on things or whatever that's going to kind of improve my value it's funny because even in my first job and we'll talk about this in a little bit is like they wouldn't get me like a fast enough computer wouldn't get a it's like I don't care I'm not looking for approval from anyone or whatever like if something's in the way that I think will improve like who I am and increase my currency I will spend that money I won't expense it I don't I don't care what were the things you you invest in that had the maybe the highest return for you that did actually make you more more High leverage that did make you more valuable increase your rate what what were the top Investments you made books were the highest cany um and I read uh which book roughly so there was um there was a author called Harvey McCay who wrote some very kind of pedestrian business books now by today's standards not sophisticated all but realized like at that age for me it's like this is brilliant it makes so much sense it's uh the one of the books was titled how to uh swim with sharks without being eaten alive I think that was one of his um swi with the sharks without being eaten alive yes exactly uh there was another one that was less about business but still it's like everything I need to know I learned in kindergarten and these are like basic very very like basic basic things but it's one of those that it's like if you're an alien from another planet which is what I felt like large part of my life it's like oh so this is how the world Works kind of thing it's like you know it seems shockingly obvious right now it just wasn't shockingly obvious to me at the time all right so that's kind of lesson number one you need to go and get lesson number two so after my Red Roof instant Where I Was Night shifting they had a computer there which was one of the nice things to do their accounting and had to close the books that was part of my jobs that was some my early exposure to computers but then I was able to get a job at US steel no [ __ ] that's pretty that's pretty cool all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity to validate for your next business idea so if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started so if you're interested there's a link below click it and you can have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show and that was my first real programming job and they would hire they hired me as an actual software developer at us deal I was still going through school working on my undergrad um and it was great I loved uh you know loved the work and the US steal plant that I was working at was in Gary Indiana and I don't know things may have changed now I don't know uh Gary Indiana was at the like top of the list of like the place you did not want to be as it turns out Indiana overall was you know fine state but it's like very northish uh and very cold and I had just come over from India and so I did a very me thing to do which was it's like okay well I have a job at US steel it doesn't really matter you know I'm talking to a main frame I'm writing my code or whatever do they have other places like it's a big company as it turns out us steel has a plant in Birmingham Alabama did not know where it was never been to Alabama but one thing I did know was like oh it's more south then here thing number one and number two is like it's not Gary Indiana so the mathematical odds of it being a worst place because I looked this up is like are slim to none so Birmingham Alabama still not one than necessarily at the time um best places to be but I'm like so I requested a transfer it's like hey I'm working at software I know I'm new but I I see that you have a plant down in Birmingham Alabama can I go work down there and they said sure knock yourself out so I get down to Alabama I'm working for us deal and I'm an I'm impatient person but I was like working like okay well and I was making uh I think it was like around $27,000 a year which was a lot better than I used to be making at Red Roof in and it was a full-time job like because I didn't have to like crown for hours or anything like that it was an actual salary which was awesome the thing I learned though is like okay so how do I like progress like how do I kind of grow and the thing I figured out um and this was said to me by kind of my manager he almost said it in in these kind of words which is look if you're not making steel shipping steel transporting steel moving steel or selling steel you're overhead and like that's the like the time that the Epiphany like sort of hit me it's like well I don't want to be overhead like I don't want to do that and so then like this is once again I'm a very very simplistic guy it's like okay well my thing is software development where do I need to work where I'm not overhead right and so then the kind of extrapolation is oh well I to work at a company where software is the actual product just like steel is the actual product for us Ste I to get closer to kind of what the actual value is so I open the Sunday paper which is what we did back then this is pre- internet days and I'm like look for jobs at companies that are software companies and so I applied for a job at a software company that happened to have a a job ad in the paper in Birmingham and it was a a place called suard Data Systems it was a software bonified software company apply for a job there um got that job which is awesome and that was life-changing of itself it's like okay software companies when it comes to software developers are much better treating developers than non-software companies as it turns out as a rule so like this is awesome and so the kind of the file away lesson here would be um your value is kind of inversely proportional to the distance from the actual value creation whatever it happens to be so if you're not in there find a way to get there whatever I'm not saying you have to be in software development but like the guy like my manager had said you have to be making steel selling steel or shipping steel whatever everything else is sort of meta and just overhead and once again this was a 90s right I think people have a more nuanced approach to how value gets created but if you have a chance to get closer to the actual customer closer to the actual product uh you should take that that will kind increase your leverage increase your currency so I'm working at sard as a software developer um and this is a good story I I'll share there's High utility in this story so I'm working there and I I'm making I think it's around 40,000 a year um at that time which this is 90 early 90s give or take and B M you that was actually pretty good money um so they paid me and the thing I was doing um is that uh suard software product was like a Mainframe product so it had the character mode terminals that you guys see in the movies now well there's still mem frames out there but most normal people don't have to interact with them but anyway but they were in the process of trying to build a graphical user interface which is the you the latest thing back then that interacted with their Mainframe they wanted offer like a Windows kind of goey on top of their main frame so my job was to they take this character mode screen and create using this drag and drop tool a guey equivalent of that particular screen there were hundreds of screens in the sunngard product it was a big kind of multi-million dollar product and I'm like well this is stupid easy and we had Consultants on there because they were trying to kind of accelerate the development and the consultant I remember this vividly was making $125 an hour to do this uh what thought of as being relatively rote work right I'm like two months into the job um so I go to my boss and I'm like you know we're paying these guys $125 an hour and all they're really doing is dragging dropping based on this character mode screen or whatever this is not software development and by the way this is so trivial my brother who has not graduated high school yet he works at the Piggly Wiggly which is a grocery chain down the South even he could do this like in a day that's how why are we paying these people $125 an hour does not make any sense and so my boss said bring him in so I brought my brother in he's 17 uh still hasn't graduated high school showed him what we're doing he like okay look at the screen over here do this over here you drag and drop in here and I'll I'll review your work at the end of the day we didn't know what to pay him uh so we paid him $5 an hour so my brother starts working there I'm there and we're cranking along kind of building this new product uh I hired all my classmates uh from undergrad because that team is growing we're kind of doing this new product product uh at suard and I I continually kind of get uh impatient I'm like okay well now I'm at a software company now I know the value that I'm creating it's like okay like what gives and I'm so I'm like constantly kind of going back to them it's like like what do I have to do I'm still an individual contributor by the way I don't not managing anybody but I'm like I get the way this stuff is working and so they were actually super super nice and generous and so they kind of bumped me and kept bumping me and it was only there for like I think it was like 14 months or something like that um and So eventually they were paying me like a quar million dollars a year in Birmingham Alabama in the early 90s and I've only been there a year and a half because I was able to kind of connect the dots on on the value being created and then I sort of got tired of because I think it was just kind of wrong of me to ca they go back to them because they were paying me like really well right it's like okay well like I sort of hit my ceiling of what's reasonable now for me to ask of this software company um to pay me he like okay well what do I have to do it's like well I have to get closer to the value creation or whatever is like like start my own software company that was the kind of I had no product idea that's like oh this is the thing I need to do like like they thought that went into my head is like oh in order for me to like do better and kind of get more leverage on my time I'm going to now have to leave stuard and go do my own thing and figure out like software to build and go do this and the one thing I do know like how to do is make developers happy because I hired you know I hired all my friends I like I know what makes a developer click and that was the had Genesis of my first startup and and the lesson here is that I'm going to have to share this this one one story I'm going to regret this because uh I'm gonna share it it's a good story um so in one of those kind of discussions um with my man or what I'm going back it's like okay like what else do I have to do uh I didn't have any particular numb you're like 27 at this point 26 25 uh yeah roughly yeah roughly 27 somewhere in my yep 25 or 30 um and so play was starting to get ridiculous so he he came back like dares do you really think you're going to find that many companies that are going to pay you x amount of you know like $200,000 or whatever it was that would have you taken in that conversation and this kind of came to me in the moment um and and the line I came back with was well as it turns out this is the very kind of mathematical side of me it's like I really don't need to find that many companies that will pay me $200,000 a year I just need to find one and I think there's one out there that's all it wasn't on a threat it was a very just a very measured like logical like a spock-like response right like like that's not the function we're solving for we're not solving for you know what is the local Maxima in terms of how many companies are out there that will pay you know and what's the standard distribution none of that matters like I don't need to find like aund of them like I'm I'm mobile I'm willing to go anywhere it's like I'm willing to bet money that if I looked I could find one right like that's um like the most you agreed with him in a way right he's like do you think you find 100 compan out here that are willing to pay you this like no but the good news is I didn't need 100 I need one and I believe that there's one out there and that you know that applies to dating that applies to being successful at one bit you know making one business work will do enough to change your life and and so that there's two lessons to draw from that uh one is you the power of negotiation uh which is one of my other like one of my favorite books most recommended books is um uh getting to yes which from the Harvard U negotiation project and that's the one book I think I've read like four times now I reread it um like every few years can you give us a quick insight for anybody who hasn't read the book like me um what's an Insight from there that would make me a better negotiator most people when they think of a negotiation they think about this kind of adversarial it's me as a zero SU game this is what's happening and as it turns out most negotiations uh both in life and in business um are actually not like that and and that first order thinking in terms of like oh like you know my objective is to get the lowest price and their objective is to get the highest price for the thing I'm trying to buy for them whether it's a house or whatever and that's not the way to think about it the way to think about it is to identify what your actual needs are what's truly the thing are if you're solving for Price fine but recognize that and do your best to identify what the other parties needs are because there is often very very often a path that actually will optimize for both of you and that's actually a better path than just try to divide the pie and fighting over price or whatever there might be something else that's actually more important right um and and so this applies to so many different situations and we like I I'll give you like a a tangible example that I think a mistake companies make building their operating system in terms of how they run was something that HubSpot has taken to heart is that we automatically think that what you people are solving for is like compensation number one and autonomy and discretion and scope like and those are all important as it turns out the number one on the feature list of what people want is actually flexibility like if they would trade a lot of other things in exchange for flexibility right if you can just get to the bottom of that if you understand that then you can sort of tree off other things that might actually have a higher price to you like but flexibility like okay like we can do that yeah there's a cost to it but the cost of not providing that flexibility is actually much higher because the talent density is going to be lower we're gonna have to pay more all things being equal um but anyway that that's the big lesson from uh getting to yes there's a bunch of other ones that it's an easy read too by the way it's not a particularly like dense heavy read um I even if you're not in business if you're just in life uh it's a book worth reading when when Jeremy gfin came on the podcast he said it uh he said the same idea definitely he goes we asked him what did you learn about negotiating from Chris Barling who who is one of the guys at tiny and he said I used to think negotiating is like this two people sitting across from each other the table sort of I want this no I want this the adversarial thing he goes Chris just told me imagine you're both sitting on the same side of the table and you're looking at the other side of the table and there's the problem and you both are looking at the problem and saying oh okay so the problem is that you're looking for this and I'm looking for this and then there's this other thing we haven't even discussed yet how can we just how can we together figure out this problem and fundamentally just taking a different taking that lens will allow you to be more successful in negotiation let's say you're negotiating something that I think is a uh what I would call a non-c commoditize thing it's hard to figure out the price it's a unique property it could be a a house somewhere where there's not 100 hous on the streets that just something that's unique and hard to find comparables on whether it's doesn't matter what it is uh the Temptation is to go in as a buyer and say well it's got this wrong with it this is wrong with it that's wrong with it I'm going to have to fix that and it's like it's you know and to try to kind of Drive the buyer's expectations down that's actually not the optimal approach uh in in this situation these kinds of situations and the reason is the visceral reaction most people have that are sitting on a unique property like that is oh like he doesn't actually understand the value he's poking his holes all but he doesn't get the fact that this this this and the other thing what I need to do is find someone that actually appreciates the value of this thing and then I'll do better on the price right and and there's no objective value because there's no comparable like no one really knows what the actual fair value is now flipped out his head let's say went of that same property I'm like this place is fantastic I love it let me tell you the things I love about it let me tell you why like I am like all in love with this thing that you're selling right now and you go through that and it has to be authentic has to be genuine I'm not making this up um and and then I put my price out there it's like you know here's what it is now the the seller has to say okay well am I really going to fight like I don't know what the price is this person seems relatively clueful he loves this place am I going to find someone else that loves it more than daresh loves it probably not like he so he gets this thing or whatever so maybe his price is probably what the fair price should be right like that he seemed like a reasonable guy so that say it takes people's guards out and this only works by the way when you have well those kind of rare is hard to find comps whatever the price is not really objectively known it's hard to kind of try relate to a like a quote unquote true price um anyway that's my that's great how negotiating tip of the day so okay great and so you um you told me something when we were talking before about this first company and you said okay so I did this company and actually maybe there's more in that first company but you told me something great that I want to bring up which is then you did a second company and this was one that I don't even know if it's on your LinkedIn you're like this is my embarrassing company it's my things didn't go well and Sam the story he told was he was like I did the first company when I just didn't know I didn't know anything about anything so I'm clueless blah blah blah we just making up as we go super Scrappy and and it kind of worked it worked uh then he's like I'm gonna do the second one but now I'm so much smarter now I actually know what I'm doing I have some experience I'm gonna do things the right way this time I'm GNA go raise money I'm gonna hire better people I'm gonna get a better off i g to do these other I'm gonna do it proper and then I guess that that business I you can tell the story here but it didn't work but you said some a great line you go just because you were just because I was ignorant doesn't mean I was wrong me meaning that first time I did that first business I was ignorant I didn't know anything but it doesn't mean I was wrong can you can you unpack that idea let's say there was an objective truth function that says okay this was in this particular situation the right decision to make in whatever uh situation you're in right now that objective truth function if we had run against all the decisions I made in that first startup I think my hit rate was actually pretty high and the hit rate of lots of Founders because our Natural Instincts in that situation actually turned out to be good instincts like being like resourceful and not kind of spending too quickly or whatever taking your time doing all the things that kind of Came As Natural Instinct and I was not a natural born entrepreneur was probably U likely why I have the insecurity but in something like a like a startup or entrepreneurship there's a bunch of decisions you're going to make a lot of them maybe may or may not be optimal but what was definitely suboptimal in hindsight was second guessing myself on the second L like I'm going to do the opposite of what I did my first one because it's like like what a chump I was back then uh so I'm going to go I'm going to do a speedrun I'm going to do it faster I'm going to write a $500,000 check to myself on day one to fund the thing or whatever it's like like who has time we don't have time to go through those kind of Cycles or whatever really quick I I remember a time in high school I had this like hillbilly friend that had like a huge chest because he was like so strong at bench pressing and we went to like an exercise class and the teacher was like the best way to get strong in your chest is to do incline bench press at a 30° angle a 30° angle is so much better than a 45 degree and so much better than a 10° and my redneck friend who didn't know anything he just would go down and lift weights he was like I must have been doing them at 30 degrees because I'm strong as [ __ ] like it's like the same thing like dude it doesn't matter like if you know what you're doing or not it's always get the end result what was your uh what was the second company I had no idea that you had a failure under your belt Yeah Yeah well yeah yes um I had so it was a kind of Facebook before Facebook for small business it was like effectively a CRM uh so I've been working CRM now for a long long time built for small businesses and this was right in like the 2000 time frame so right as the bubble was bursting and the first company was not an internet company this was it was a web- based uh Information Management tool for small businesses uh around customer what was it called it was called captivo uh cap a p TI V how much did you raise and how long did it last before you shuttered it um so once again because I was going to do things differently this time I wrote the first $500,000 check and I kept writing checks I'm like I have money why would I not like just fun of myself um can you say can you say how how how much did you how much did you have and how much of that did you put into this second one can you say that um I think I probably put in about two million I'll say give or take I found uh I Googled captivo Dar mash and I found a PDF that has a lot of handwriting on it and it looks like it's a case study for Sloan and uh you're trying to make a point and you said uh in 99 I founded my second startup called captivo uh this is what it was it was in many aspects similar to Salesforce and about two years in of the product development and over a million dollars of capital invested mostly of my own captivo could still not gain any significant traction and ultimately it was sold in the Pro uh and it didn't work out and so this is like the only thing that I can find about captivo on the Internet is a case study that you helped write by the way and it's like we sort of take it for granted now part of the why and it's not like you know I'm not trying to hide things uh but the internet wasn't as big a deal back then so yeah I wasn't blogging no one was blogging so it was like okay why would you just say things like where are you going to say them to um but so what one of the um kind of interesting things as far as kind of closing out that particular chapter what ended up happening I'm going to make my third sports ball reference and this one's a golf one it was a long put to par uh what happened was I took that company captivo merged it into my first startup which I had not sold yet so I was doing two um two startups at the same time which is not something one should do um and then ended up selling the kind of merged entity so I ended up making my back for all intents and purposes I didn't really lose anything but it was a very very long buet par I just yeah um so the big idea so far where uh at the beginning you're going to trade time for money and then at some point in your life you're going to desperately start trying to trade money back for time uh that's life I think that's that's a golden nugget the second one is cool you can either get more hours or increase the the value per hour and that's where you started taking budget and investing it in books and training and seminar whatever whatever you can try to do to increase your own value you get the job at US steel that's where you realize you're either an asset or a liability to this company you're either overhead or you're the one actually creating value if you want to be higher leverage you got to be closer to where the actual value is created so then you switch you do a software company you do that the lesson around negotiation so go back and ask for more and specifically not just ask for more but what would it take for me to be making more it's more more like the question you asked your boss is that right the actual lesson um I I drew from that is the the power of being able to reduce and frame something in a very simple like inarguable way right like the fact that it was so Punchy right like it was just that one sense I don't need to find a bunch of companies I just need to find one and I think I can right like had that been like a five minute long conversation me going back and forth or whatever and trying to make an argument I don't think it would have worked what made it work was the fact and this is I think is a very very it's a like anything else it's a developable skill and you like are like actually Sean the master of this is being able to what I call like inside compression right and I just made that up it says can you take some big idea and kind of boil it down boil it down to like it's the the essence is still captured and it's just a dense distillation for lack of a better term of that idea of that concept down to something really simple um because the simpler you can make it the more likely uh it is to be transmissible to be communicated to be whatever and this applies to Thum obviously applies to you know copyrighting and marketing and things like that applies to venture pitches applies to so many things by the way I think one good point to make in this is this isn't just a mindset you had when you were young and broke like you took my power writing course a few years ago it's like dude this guy's a you're a founder of a 2030 billion dollar public company he's sitting here in the course learning it's seeing can I learn something about writing can I get a little bit better at this one skill you were still doing that now not just when you were you know 20 years old it's like Oh I'm a I got to like you know start to level up it seemed like you continued doing it a guy came on the podcast the other day Mike poser he's a musical artist he talked about he had had his first song Go huge so he thought oh that's what I do I make songs they they blow up that's that's me I guess it's hard for these other people it's not hard for me so the first song is like you know whatever five times Platinum his second song actually was still like double Platinum but felt like a huge failure third song Single Platinum he's like I'm going downhill and then the studio shelves them and for years they they they're like it's too expensive for you to even produce the music so we're just going to keep you you know you're on the Shelf in the music industry I was like what were you doing during that time and I thought he would just say he was depressed eating Cheetos on the couch he's like yeah I was depressed eating Cheetos on the couch and then I dusted off the Cheeto dust for a minute he's like and I enrolled in um at Berkeley College for music and he's like I was learning to improve my singing my my ability to play instruments I couldn't play the guitar before that so I learned to play the guitar and he's like yeah I just figured okay this period of my life I'll just sharpen up my skill I'll become a better artist and he's like I would go to these classes with a bunch of college kids and here I am you know Grammy Award winning I've been on the charts I've made millions of dollars as an artist and there's better singers in here than me and he's like I it was a a real mind [ __ ] but what I took from that whole story was damn that's kind of inspiring like this guy used that time to sharpen his skills um I think a lot of adults just stop I think they just oh that's stuff you do when you're young and you just don't need to invest in learning anymore after that so talking about the power writing course that you have and then just kind of writing and and copywriting generally is that the return on time for developing writing I have not found the ceiling yet uh is that it is just so high I cannot describe to people like if you could do nothing else let's say you you had five hours to invest in the next month or something like that you could spend it all on learning how to write well and future you will look back on those five hours and say boy that was a great use of five hours right or 10 hour whatever the number is right because that's what I consider to be a just an amplifier of things right it it will make you a better thinker better Communicator better piter better salesperson better everything we were talking about uh being close to the action I don't remember if you talked about this on the Pod or or if you talked about it just privately but I had known that you bought chat.com and we have known that you've been about agents I think last podcast we talked about uh vectors and things like that I think I think we mentioned agents and it seems like that's like a big thing to you right now and speaking of being close to the action you bought this thing chat.com I think you said on the podcast it was something like $10 million or maybe you said eight figures I forget and then it comes out like two weeks ago that you sold the domain chat.com to open AI for around eight figures and I think it said it was like all well we should add one thing when you came on the Pod you had just bought it and we were like what are you g to do with it you're like not super sure you know I'm gonna try some things um but I just think it's a great domain I think it's a great invest and you just you had made a bet but you didn't have the it's not like you had it all figured out and it was all drisk y um you made that bet then now here's the update what happen Okay so a couple things just kind of um so I I think the time I went on the Pod was like within like 72 hours of when that kind of purchase that happened so it was just was just done it was not distilled in my head actually had a plan for it I was going to build um a chat application on top of the GPT algorithm similar to chat GPT and thesis and I this is there were there have been two times where I accidentally competed with open eye which I don't advise anyone to ever do uh uh he's on like literally on the top of my list of people I'd ever want to compete with is Sam Alman just too smart and even a more redblood capitalist than I am actually and I mean that in the most positive way so my original thought was it's like okay they put this chat GPT thing out there it's a demo app right it's like it's there to demonstrate the power of large language models and the underlying GPT algorithm but open AI is a platform company the only and and there have been stories about these kinds of things which is oh someone invents a cool new technology uh I think PayPal started that way they had some payment transfer thing and they had an app that says oh here's our encryption technology demonstrated by me sending you money over a Palm Pilot or something like that um and they're like oh well that encrypt we don't care about we care about the actual transfer of money part that's is it the story withi like they you know were doing this thing to sell to software company and then someone's like dude can you just make this thing so we could show people what we're working on yeah that's what and even Sam has kind of gone on record and said that right they had not expected it to kind of go it's like this is a way for us to kind of demonstrate the technology and kind of make it accessible so people can try it uh and so it sort of caught them off guard as well right which is like this was not it was not expected they were G to get tens of millions and it was 100 million users within a couple of months but in the back of my head I'm like okay well that's great but they're going to go back to being a platform company but someone should actually create something that is that end user application that sits on top of llm like like gpt3 at the time and then it just so happens it's one of those uh the universe sort of configured itself and like chat come in a random uh event became available for sale for the first time in like 30 years that never been actually used before and I'm like I just I need to do this it was like that was but that was kind of thing number one it's like I could I could use it for that thing number two um kind of rationalization to myself is that like this is the cover charge to get into the AI party uh that people will take me seriously it's like like no one really knew me in that space because I I you I'm not from that world uh you know didn't go to machine learning school at Stanford or something like that but that's sort of something that's sort of hard to ignore like and deep down inside I'm part marketer right I think it's uh it's like oh this is a good story it'll get people's attention did they reach out to you with the idea of acquiring it or did you were you like at a conference with them and you're like hey I have this thing if you want it like I'll tell you okay so um I'm going to draw the line in terms of uh at the transaction Beyond because my experience I I think I'm at Liberty to share uh what happened post that uh decision um I'm less comfortable sharing so uh the way it kind of came to be is that I was at a seoa event I think I actually talked about um this U on the Pod and one of the things that Sam announced at that event as Sam Al was there was oh know uh chat GPT you guys know yeah it's awesome we're going to like support um these plugins to chat GPT because right now the limitation of chat GPT can't access third party data source they can't really do anything and it's got the data that it's got based on its training data set um but it's like a snapshot in time but these extensions will sort of amplify multiply uh the capabilities of of chat GPT and so that's sort of when the little switch went off in my head I'm like crap open AI wants to create the chat GPT of chat GPT you know it's like the like they're going to turn this into an actual platform an actual end user M user app and so that's when I'm like okay if I'm not going to do something I think it would be like unwise for me to keep that domain it's like I don't want to just you know sit on if I'm I don't have plans to do something with it I did not want to go into competition with open AI because it was clear that this was going to be a big bet for them that's thought you I was treating it as some of a side hobby project uh so I reached out to S who I knew it's like do I don't know if you were like interested or like and there were other biders for the domain at the time that it went for sale and like my third back of Mind motivation was uh I I had a suspicion of who some of the other players might be I didn't want them to have it either just the kind of competitive side of me did you sell it for a profit or was it just like a like you like you I think you said on Twitter you sold it for shares of open a was it like man I'll just uh give it to you for the cost in order to be able to invest in your company I thought I did I did this uh cleverly uh when I made the announcement that I had sold it uh I didn't the details but I I I provided a a GPT prompt that says if you type this into chat GPT that says oh dares likes to buy domain names but he usually does it because he's got a project in mind dares doesn't sell domain names at a loss because he doesn't have to dares also doesn't like profiting from his friends and he considers you he's known Sam for a while or so open AI did buy chat GB these are the facts that you know and then it's like and then the prompt is if you had to guess what do you think you know the that the domain sold for because you I'd also disclosed I was a shareholder in open AI this was happened a while ago and so it's like you weren't a shareholder before that you weren't like yeah so but you would have loved to be an investor in in open Ai and this was like you said the cover charge it was the ante in order to get there this was like a even a even a better party right this is the shareholder party that's uh yeah I think based on all that I think I put your prompt in and it was like darash bought the domain for $55 million and now owns $55 million of open AI stock that that was like the uh that was the the AI answer to it you can leave it at that yeah we'll leave it at that um that's so funny so do do you have any all right so one thing I have to I have to have to share with you and this is the uh non-h humble utility part of it but there's a lesson in here so there's an old uh Steve Jobs quote around connecting dots and the quote goes something like you can't connect the dots looking forward you can only connect them looking backwards so you have to have faith faith in something that the kind of dots will connect at some point feature you just have to trust your instincts and and uh I've been a big believer in that even before um job said those words which is you know you sort of collect um you know what he calls dots and I really like the idea because I love graphs um list of things that I love it's like okay well if I made an inventory of all the dots that I've collected through my life and and dots can be people I've met can be skills I've learned things experience lessons uh and then over time if I had to go back and like write a history of my life and say oh well this was kind of a weird dot at the top time like I could never have guessed that had it been not for that do this over here probably would never have happened right like you don't know in a parallel universe like what was actually going to sh but I can tell you for for a fact that the Universe hasn't exist right now would not have happened had that particular dot not been collected that I had not collected it and so the my my big lesson here is that you have to spend some amount of your time this is the same kind of lesson just phrase differently around investing in those dots uh that may or may not make sense at the time that you're doing them uh but they feel right they feel like they could have something and it doesn't have to all be kind of maniacally diabolical and capitalist sometimes it's just like I want to collect this dot because I love this I believe in I have conviction whatever it is right it's like it's you uh it's your time on the planet it's your money whatever it is you're doing uh you should be able to kind of collect those dots but if you kind of trust your instincts on so and not all the dots are going to work out and this is the beauty of these kinds of things is that you don't need for all of them to work you just need one or two to work really well and that's it like that's literally right um I'll use a sports reference in basketball there's people who you say have a nose for the ball they just know where the ball's going to bounce they know where to be the ball just sort of always ends up in their hand they end up in the right spot you talked about your first job application was to Pizza Hut you back when you're you know just moved to the country type of thing but pretty quickly you found yourself in software development in the 90s which is arguably the best place to be then you you said in 2000 you started a web internet company internet was the next best place to be after that then you create HubSpot which was a cloud SAS company which is arguably the next best place to be for that next decade and now you just sold chat uh chat.com to open AI you had a bunch of open Ai and you were talking about AI agents and I would say that seems like in this decade the best place to be and so I view you as somebody who has a nose for the ball and what I mean by that is like the frontier that you're interested in seems to be the frontier where all of the and the value and the trillion dollar companies are going to get created which means if the trillion dollar companies are created that means the tens of billions of dollar companies are going to get created the billion dollar the hundred million and the10 million dollar companies also uh it just means it's the it's the target-rich environment so I think that when you say this is the thing I'm most interested in we should pay attention all right tell us why agents are the thing we should pay attention to yeah U and I'm kind of bringing it back to the kind of early just as uh thank you for the lead in this is that was great um is that you know we talk about you the audience making your first million or your next million if you're uh you further along in the in the journey is that you that that first one is almost always harder than subsequent ones and that's and that's not counterintuitive at all um I will say this though is that never in my mind has it been easier to get to that first million than it's going to be here like as we're as we're living our lives right now and and part of that um is what uh agents unlock so let's talk about agents we'll talk about what they are why why such a massive opportunity and what you uh the audience should do about it um okay so we'll take a uh step back to last year last year was all about chat and like and everyone's used chat GPT we all get it we type in a prompt something comes back awesome and that's what's uh a very kind of interactive approach to the use of AI right like you type a PL it's like oh give me a blog post or do this for me and it comes back with a response and you may do a followup but it's it's effectively this kind of back and forth interaction model um with with AI what Asians and and as a result of kind of interactive model the the tasks that you assign AI are generally more discreet that says okay do this for me there's a single artifact produce a blog post generate image whatever happens to be what agents are uh kind of very simply are it's AI software that can accomplish higher level goals requiring multiple tasks I mean multiple steps so it's not just a one shot give me a blog post and it comes back with a blog post it's like I want you to do this thing and that thing may require 10 steps and each of those things as we were just talking about earlier it might need to functionally decompose everything in order to accomplish that high goal and it has to have memory it has to do all these things in order to kind of make that possible but that's what a an AI agent is and right now we're going to you know talk about agents as as it currently stands uh my expectation is that agents are the new apps it's it's just software right so when mobile came along it's like oh there's an app for that there's an app for it's like like not that far in the distant future like everything is going to be there's going to be hundreds of thousands of millions of Agents right the same way there's lots and lots of apps out there uh so think about agent if it's simpler to do that it's like it's just an AI app that happens to do really high order or can do high order goals requiring multiple multiple steps so the thing I think uh without getting into um agent. too much here's kind of my my view of the world in terms of how this is going to shape out there's lots of debate going around uh oh in order for it to be an AI true AI agent it has to be autonomous you can't have you know it's like you just have to be able to go give it a goal I'm more pragmatic than that I don't think that's a a requirement in order for something to to be called an agent but um here's the important part is that so if you kind of pull out that thread the way the world looks um soon is that we will have hybrid teams that consist of humans and consist of AI agents and the easiest simplest and therefore in my I'm going to say this with some uh conviction because it's better to do it that way the EAS way to pull that off and the simplest way to describe it is if you think of the digital agent as a digital team member because that's the easiest way to get there from here right it's like okay if you just stay up just going to hand it over the the agent is going to create the like just do all the things there's going to be no humans yeah that might happen someday but it's probably not going to happen as a direct jump from where we are today what's likely going to happen is that individual tasks will get automated and we will start injecting um and having these hybrid teams in the same way we had hybrid teams before we had out like all fulltime employees like oh I'm going to hire a freelancer for three months to do this because we don't need them forever whatever for whatever reason you did that and like that's okay they don't work in the office then we had hybrid from a geographic perspective and now we're gonna have hybrid from a carbon based life for versus non-carbon based life for perspective basally like this it's like we've got guests coming over and now my wife decomposes that into okay we need to clean the kitchen um this we need to clean this area and we need to get food uh we need to order food and so she tells me load the dish washer I go load the dishwasher then I hand it over to my agent my dishwasher agent who then will wash those dishes and so I'm kind of the she's the she decomposes it I'm a human in the loop I'm doing one step that hope ideally that we could have another robot that loads the dishwasher but for that for now I do that but the dishwasher is better at doing the dishes than I even was and will do it well every single time I trust that agent to do it that's what com the inside of companies is going to look like yes and it might be that um you know and I I think we will have humans doing the review and approval for a vast majority of tasks right so I think the the the digital team members for lack of a better term are going to be doing lower level task to start with because that's the things we can trust them with it's like okay well the the stakes are much much lower it's like okay produce 10 versions of this blog article it's really like super important for my business but then let me pick the one that's actually going to go out and then once I pick the one that's going to go out because I'm a step in the process the human doing that then the postproduction maybe is All Digital we don't know right give us an example of an agent you're using that like you actually use now CU you know on a day-to-day basis or week toe basis is actually you know live it's working it's not just to cool we good nice simple example is um I have an agent that says so I really like this episode of let's say my first million um and I recall hearing something about X like some some word stuck into my mind uh and I want to write a LinkedIn post based on that so here's but here's what I want to happen I want to All I'm going to give it as input this is the instructions kind of NPC model right it's like okay here's what you get from me um is a YouTube video what I want as an output is a LinkedIn post that's going to do well by some definition of do well uh we have training data on that okay what it's going to do is going to say okay first step one pull the transcript from a YouTube video step two figure out who the players are step three highlight the things that are quote worthy tweet worthy remark worthy whatever it was happens to be step four figure out what the hell darbes was actually asking about there was a snippet in there that you made reference to CLI that as well put that all into thing now go say okay like what style happens to work well on LinkedIn specifically I was like you're write me a 200-word prompt that describes the language and the style whether it's bullet points whether it uses emojis doesn't use them like what works have an agent that does that like a style Creator thing whatever take all of that and now produce a LinkedIn post and and just give it to me and so you do that you have a thing that does that I I have a thing that does that and and by the way and the the the really fun part about this is it's like Lego bricks right so I haven't agent that does a YouTube transcript rely straightforward but it's a better YouTube transcript than the one that you would just get copying off the web because there's an LM involved it's like I want a YouTube SC transcript that has chapter headings which not going to be in the transcript that's going to Bull things that are actual quotes or whatever it's going to format it in a way that's human consumable way better transcript than the regular transcript you get out of YouTube so like what check this out darash have you seen this go to MFM vault.com MFM my friend Greg is building this um and it's not it's not ready for uh you know the big time but here we are let's let's do it so MFM vault.com you land here so what he built basically a site that kind of works like what you described just for specifically my first million podcast and fans okay so he's like all right he was like I don't just want summaries I want he's like you know I like MFM because it's got ideas it's got Frameworks it's got stories and those are like the big things that he really cared about so if I just go like First's got just like a bunch of and AI is basically extracting those from every episode it's like searching for Frameworks searching for stories Etc but like let me just show you this if I go to episodes we try this live see if this works and I type dares and this is our last episode we did in 2023 so it's got the the you know the overall summary with chapter titles like you said here but check this out so if I go to stories it's like chat spots $1 sale uh Pandora's a manual musicians it's like the 17-year evolution of chat and if I click that it'll take me to that moment but it'll also summarize it there's also Frameworks in here like an AI immersion week basically uh the idea here was how I dedicated a full week to just Hands-On experimentation with AI tools only and so it is extracting and categorizing and linking these ideas from the podcast this way but to do it he's like you said he's strung together five agents there's the the listen for when there's a new episode then that guy says I found a new episode pass it to the transcriber transcriber like I transcribed it pass it to the summarizer and the extractor passes it to those guys he's like great turn that into Clips pass it to the clip guy right and each one of those is their own agent and I think that's that's and then like you said it's composable Lego block block so if I want to use a summarizer for something else well that's once that agent exists he can summarize anything not just MFM episodes yep that that that is the future Sean so um so just like a quick one sentence description this is the positioning uh I'm going to test it out on you guys as well is agent. is the number one Professional Network for AI agents it is also the only Professional Network for AI agents it's LinkedIn for agents yes and and and so the question is like why why do agents need their own Professional Network right that that's a a reasonable question to ask and the answer is if we imagine that I happen to be right that we're going to have this hybrid world where we have both uh AI teammates and carbon based life form teammates well how are we going to find those people right so we have Fiverr for humans that we can I need a logo created for whatever I I can go to upw workk I want to hire someone for the next you know four months to do whatever skill set or whatever there needs to be an equivalent of that for AI agents right this I don't know what's out there like I don't know and and here's where it starts to get really kind of uh super cool so imagine a professional Network and it has ratings and reviews it's got their experience like oh I'm an agent that does this I've been used 40,000 times and here are the people that like me darash follows me on on agent. right because humans can follow agents agents can follow other agents and what's going to happen uh over time is that agents will be able to hire other agents on the network because everyone knows what everyone else can do they can try other agents out it's like oh I've been given a budget of $100 to try five different agents to figure out which one is the best for my particular use case and it can go without human intervention just go triy it's like oh Network like like yeah I'll pay you this other agent can this this so over 30 years I built a lot of software that is what I call solo software right like just like software for me for my my public speaking K lpms in a in a talk that kind of stuff um and then I found that most of those things little lpms laugh for minute I like it yeah by way I did not invent that term standup comedians use that that's been around forever um but yeah uh I stole that from it's Sam it's something that funny people like us we know we wouldn't expect you to understand that D can I ask you a um I'm going to ask you a rude question and then I'm going to ask you a thoughtful question but I'm going to start with the rude question question rude question is this dude you're a billionaire and you're super smart and you love all this new tech like why aren't you doing the Elon thing elon's like cool I did my zip 2 then I did PayPal then I did Tesla SpaceX I'm Gonna Keep kind of building new companies but bigger batter bets you've been at H for so long you've been there for you've been doing CRM for like 30 years like don't you feel like you want to just spread those wings baby and just fly and just go build your rocket and like what's your why why aren't you doing like a next Grand act uh that's my rude question for you yeah no it's it's it's not rude at all and the answer is actually quite simple uh and has the added value of being true is that this sort of is my next big act so the problem is okay so let's say you're playing a video game pick up your video game of choice um and and you've kind of grounded out you've built the things you've got the weapons you're you're there like you're now in kind of power mode you can do now let's say it's Zelda or something like that which love one of my favorite games um and now you can just go out exploring and try things and do stuff because you've got all of that if you're going to play a new game there's a bunch of stuff you still have even though because you have to sort of get right you're gonna have to build a team I'd have to go find a co-founder by the way I've won the co-founder Lottery right like I like no one knew it at the time but that has a massive impact on your outcome it's like there's so many things I'd have to get right just to be able to kind of do the next thing I think my odds are doing the next like even something like agent . a my odds are higher pulling that off with the infrastructure I already have beneath me in the form of HubSpot and sometimes I have to squint a little in order to kind of squeeze the thing and make it fit in a HubSpot Shake box and I have mechanisms for which I can kind of do that but I don't feel like I've ever been uh kept from doing the thing that would have been my big bold idea as a result of being uh a CTO at HubSpot if if I have like if that were the case yes I would go like you know what it's it's been a you know great ride uh you know wish the company well and will continue to be a a cheerleader but I don't I don't accept your answer but I wait why don't you why don't you accept it well let's break it down he's a logical guy let's break it down so let's say he has a has things he's excited about new technologies new ideas just potential potential to create cool [ __ ] in the world all right so there's two ways of looking at this either HubSpot um HubSpot is the best place to do that which I would just view like like not I'm not saying the infrastructure I'm just saying like the company HubSpot which has like a specific Mission and set of customers it needs to serve and like existing business model and all those things like the odds that your creative brain would latch onto an idea that also was like should be on hubot road map just seems like unlikely to me or just like a an unnecessary limit that I wouldn't put on okay so then let's say there is an idea that you you get excited about your version of SpaceX or whatever it is neuralink whatever the idea is either well hubspot's not limiting me and I'm getting these benef benefits okay cool there's that trade so it's kind of like what would you gain if you actually were out on your own you would like there's like all these things like when people have their job and then they try to have a side hustle there's one great thing when you go and you quit your job to do a startup which is that you've now quit your job to do a startup you've now told the world you've told yourself you've told everybody that like I'm gonna make a thing because I just gave up a thing and that means I got to have a new thing now and I think that the uh burn the boats thing is like probably one of the only assets or advantages a startup in general has or Entre rur has is that they they just go all in on something they don't have any meetings about anything else they don't have any distractions and they've told the world I'm going to do this and I think there's something very powerful about that and I think the if I really wanted to turn the knob and be like what would be the and by the way you don't have to do this I'm not saying one needs to do this in life but it's like let me see what I can let me see how fast this car can go let me see what I'm capable of I just view that you're more likely to see The Highest Potential version of you outside of hubot versus is doing side projects while using HubSpot and then doing talking at inbound and then taking these meetings there's got to be the the unblended version the concentrated version had to be more potent than the Blended version so that's my case Sean's triying to convince a billionaire of a founder of a $35 billion company like hey what are you g to it's the the ant telling the elephant how how he should be walk are you going to quit your job and actually do something with your life and go in on your side project take it as a compliment it means I view you as a Elon level character you know I I that's that's very high praise thank you um I'll say this like I think it's uh it needs to be said I am a big big believer um in kind of taking that leap of faith right um and and going out and doing the thing and that's great and I'll say it's it's gon to sound defensive as I don't mean it to be um but like as I kind of write the next chapters of my life as I'm looking out like one of the questions I've asked myself is like okay it's like what does success look like right like okay so like what do I want want to reflect back on like of the things that I did right it's um and a couple things have kind of emerged from that reflection is I like to build things and like that is like the truest thing that there is I like to build things right um and so one thing I've kind of managed to do which doesn't happen often so I don't have any direct reports because that would keep me from building things right like if if ever there was a time was like oh like I can no longer build things as a result of whatever X happens to be I will break down that wall whatever it is UPS spot or otherwise so that's one thing um and I I will say this and I think your Point's really well taken which is most of the time we have these kind of externally imposed rules on us for instance if you're an engineer it's like well you're CTO you shouldn't be writing code anymore it's like and I don't I do not uh accept that thesis because uh software is a creative discipline it's a very hits driven business you have to be right a very few number of times it's like we don't tell a musicians that's really really good oh you just stop like writing music and doing music and go hire some people we don't tell exceptional writers to stop writing and you know manage a team of writers like keep writing let the others try do your best to minimize the stuff that's not writing time um and that's what I feel like I'm doing I'm maximizing my build time uh and to me it's and my personal mission statement is to help Millions grow better like that's the simple like I want to be able to look back on it and say I had a positive impact on the most number of people like that that m house like x amount of impact whatever that impact is on y number of people that's my truth function and this is why I don't do one-on-one meeting because it doesn't scale right this is one of the reasons I'm here and not elsewhere it's not just because I like you guys it's because I can have an impact and the reason I chose the topic like this what I want to talk about it's like ah you know what's the best way for me to use this time that if I look back on it or the people that are spending an hour and a halfish um you know listening to this like was that a good use of my time did it actually did daresh deliver on the promise of at least marginally increase me my probability of making my first or next million right that's the you you you you do this a lot you kind of like are telling a story and you have like these little like bits that are like wildly fascinating one of them being that you have like a personal mission do you have personal values like a company does that you you and your family or just you operate against we've talked about it we haven't done it we have um so the the HubSpot values are effectively the founders values right that's where the original kind of company values uh came from and there and most most companies are actually a reflection of their Founders um what what is the most controversial or uh value that has the biggest tradeoff like not everybody would choose this but we choose this what what's what is that for you guys right like not like Integrity or you know like whatever things like that yeah one of the ones that uh almost didn't make the cut uh not because we don't agree with the value but there were others is humility like humbleness right and like the common argument that comes back is like we're supposed to be a winning team we're aggressive which we are right and so people often confuse humility with a lack of confidence or lack of aggression assertiveness or all these things that's not it at all right the humility is is being self-aware is being able to recognize and not being a know at all it's like I'm here to learn having that kind uh and and that is a large part of what drives hpot and so I kind of I fought for that value for a long long time the second most controversial one is empathy which is our second value and that it didn't always used to be empathy we changed it along the way Sam what values on the yeah that that's a good question the the reason I've been asking this is like well I've been like thinking about like do I have values like what what are my values like it's kind of cool is denim a value or objective like it's it's kind of cool to like codify it uh but no like we don't MFM well like we kind of have values like we said the we've had people in the Pod who like have done like bad stuff and and they're like are you gonna like crucify me and we're like well like our default is not to like criticize it's like to build people up but sometimes that might happen but anyway we like so we have a couple but it's interesting to kind of explicitly say these are the values of X Y and Z and Mark zuer I I read this cool thing about him or maybe even told me in the Pod Sean where he was like a value means you have to sacrifice something so move fast and break things means we are going to move fast and because of that I am okay with breaking stuff uh like it like twoo many people their values are things that are just obvious that don't in involve a sacrifice that are just platitudes and by the way there's not there's not many of these so for example move fast and break things I think is the pantheon the Hall of Fame of like you know values um another one is like rayo's Bridgewater thing they have like radical honesty or radical cander which is like we are going to uncomfortably be honest with each other and we just think that that maximizes in the long run but in the short run this is not going to be like anywhere else you've worked because we take that we take that seriously we take the tradeoff which is discomfort for the upside of you know being radically honest so I think one I have I just because jumped to my end and I think it's uh it's it's a useful thing um so we talk about maximizing right and that's uh I love that word and um many of you have likely heard of this notion of like finding the maximum um and then the the Trap that people fall into is finding the local maximum versus the global maximum and just from a late person's perspective it's like imagine that you're kind looking at a graph like a normal imaginative bell curve um for those listening it's like oh there's a point I which that value is the highest right pop the the hill so to speak in in in mathematical terms the kind of local versus global Maxa is like okay well that's the highest point but let's say you were to zoom out on that same graph and then there's this other bell curve right next to it which is an even higher Maxima it's like okay well if you were just solving based on that chart that you were looking at because you were zoomed in you didn't actually find a maximum you found the local Maxum not the global Maxum that's the and so here's the and so that one that part of it is obvious the non-obvious art uh is that often in order to even see the global maximum you actually have to climb the local maximum Hill it can't be an abstract set out of the sidelines like oh I'm G to go like wander around yeah what you have to do sometimes is you have to make the effort to climb the smaller Hill you get to the top of the spa it's like oh now I see the landscape and there's that massive Mountain over there which is the thing that I'm actually meant to go do right and so part of and this goes back to the kind of connecting dots thesis as well is like sometimes you have to do the thing that does not seem like the big bet in order to have the perspective see what the big best going to be right Sam have you heard this concept of Rass like instead of SAS companies Ras companies saw put that on there and I was like is that like a different word like RZ what does I was like does this like Ras do that is he gonna like make fun of is is Ras mean like you're gonna make fun of me like I'm gonna Rass you no this is a big idea dares can you do the do the um so we all know SAS which is software as a service um and we contrast software as a service to software as that used to exist back in like back in my day I can say that now and back in my day software was shipped in boxes on CDs and things like that and you kind of plugged it into your computer and loaded the software up um to do whatever you wanted to do and software as a service was oh you don't actually buy the Box you don't buy the CD or whatever we just provide the value of the software to you as a service over over the Internet over the cloud results as a service is like actually you don't even access the software you tell us what it is that you actually want to do what's the outcome that you're looking for and we'll just sell you that you want the LinkedIn blog post at the end a good example would be like oh uh I could sell you like legal software to kind of analyze a contract in the real estate space that will give you commentary on whether this matches benchmarks or even in the VC World a term sheet or something like that it's like oh here software that will help you like powerite a real estate contract and do the Ed it's like it's like HubSpot here's software that you can write blog posts capture emails and get more customers yes but this thing is okay well what if you could just skip the intermediate steps like oh you want more customers what are you willing to pay for customers and this this idea is almost as old as time right which is because we've had like in that particular example we've had lead gen companies forever right which is effectively results as a service like don't worry about phone numbers don't worry about this thing called the internet or whatever pay us x amount of dollars every time your phone rings well and it's also a sales technique which is like do you want guests to feel great at your home and to be popular okay buy or vacuum to keep your carpet clean yes that's exactly yeah we've had that yeah the copy like people don't buy don't want drills they want holes right like that's that the drill is a tool whole is the actual outcome desired so Ras is kind of the next uh kind of wave of software which and there will still be software being used uh by whoever is providing the results of the service uh that's how the thing gets accomplished but the way it might be packaged and sold uh you know might end up being Ras uh one thing just closing out on the uh on the agent front as far as the call the action um so um I forget the name of the guy that built the MFM Vault Greg yeah Greg okay um so what Greg did in terms of like sequencing these things together right so he effectively built an agent right it has multisteps uh each individual step may call uh other AI tools uh agent. not only is a professional Network for Distributing agents and finding agents discovering agents reviewing and rating agents and talking about agents it also has what's called an agent Builder which is a platform for building agents without writing code you've had a good quarter uh HubSpot stock I think almost hit an alltime high you sold the business or you sold the domain to open AI came on the podcast you came on the Pod you're you're you know I don't I don't care what they say about you D you're doing okay I'm doing okay I'm doing okay I don't care what they say you're all right what I love about you is you have a bunch of things that sound like paradoxes like you're extremely gentle and kind you're also like I would say competitive and aggressive and in in other ways I think you are humble but then you're also a marketer and you're like oh I could see the marketing value of this and the the Practical value of this but I also you know I'd rather be you know quiet lowkey I don't need to brag and so you have all these like contradictory things which I think makes you interesting hey by the way is this you said there's you go as soon as I get on a leader board I want to be number one yeah you're like but then I don't want to be on list of this leader board is this a leader board or you're like I would like to be richer because it would be like like I think you you might try to be cool and be like no I'm happy but like I think with every level you are on whether you were with 1 billion you want to get 10 whether you have 10 you want to get 50 just like no matter how ripped you get you want to get a little bit more Rift like um is it is it how much of a motivator is like you know it says one on Forbes now how do I make it say 10 10 billion yeah yeah yeah well it's it's a really good question I tend not to have explicit goals like goals setting is not something and I'm not discounting it I'm not um disparaging it at all some of the smartest people um you know have goals to have those kind of like really concrete things that they're shooting for it's not that I don't do it now I never really did that right it's like okay I want to get better I want you know I want to have money I want to be able to have freedom make choices I want to have the things I in this as I've said this uh you know before I I like to configure the universe to my liking to the best of my ability and whatever resources I can kind to help make that possible I I'll go try and find a way to make that possible right that's that's um but like so like deep down inside my soul I'm a like I'm a math and physics guy that's not smart enough to be a math and physics guy right and in my truth function is like I said before it's like okay I'm trying to create based on that mission statement positive impact for the most number of people like multiply X by Y and the marketing is part of that it's like okay well I'm not going to be able to impact people uh if I'm not doing some marketing it's like I can say the most brilliant things in the world if only 17 people look at them then the value of x is 17 for that particular unit of uh unit of work and that's just not how I operate I will make sacrifices and other funds in order to solve the true like truth function to solve for the mission uh for me personally that's sort of that was the uh the balance there we talked about a bunch of stuff you had opening remarks do you have a closing remark is there a is there a way you want to end it did you achieve your mission of of of saying what you thought would help somebody increase their odds uh my ask my favor is uh leave a comment and let me know what you thought that's where I keep scoring that's the leaderboard I'm after right now he's saying it's like I'm number five on the YouTube list I know comments and engagement actually help the algorithm probably more than lights do by the way for the record um so dude you're the man we appreciate you doing this um I have a notebook here uh where I take notes I'm not going to turn it I don't want people to see it but um I have Phil three pages of notes um so you're the man it's all good pleasure beond thanks thanks for having me thanks for indulging my uh indulging my quirks dude you're great man you're fun to hang out with like you you are fun to hang out with you're fun to talk to I feel energized when I talk to you good to see you guys we appreciate you that's a [Music] pod for

that's the trend that I can't I can't like unsee it sometimes and right that's the bet you're making that's the bet we make and so I always joke with the guys here like we want to bet on negative 1 to zero like Peter the talked about the 0 to1 companies like we still one step even before [Music] that all right for KH we're here it's amazing uh I haven't seen you in a little while people don't know we used to work together maybe five six years we co-founded company and launched a bunch of products and uh ate a bunch of [ __ ] together and here we are fun times by the way yeah I'm thinking the title of this is going to be because Apple 11 is now 50 60 billion dollar company yeah $50 billion founder tells me the next big thing in AI I'm going to go full YouTube clickbait with it yeah the great we so we used to do this thing where after we did bibo together got AC quiet we were there for a year or so and then we all we went off and we did different things I started the podcast and started doing my thing you started doing yours but I hit you up and I was like hey miss hanging out with you what if we did something and we we started doing this on Wednesdays which was like the cool [ __ ] hour and this was amazing it's basically a show in tell where you my smartest friend would come on Wednesdays and you'd be like hey have you seen this have you seen this have you seen this and I really hadn't seen any of it and you would kind of explain it and teach it to me and it was my favorite part of of the week and we did that for I don't know probably like a year or something like that so I kind of want this to be like a public version of the cool [ __ ] hour where you're just going to tell me a bunch of good things I want to start with AI because you texted me something you said AI agents are here and you said AI is cool because a 10 person company feels like it can do the work of a 100 person company and we're using it in our company so I wanted to hear what are you doing with AI and and that's not called chat GPT I think this word AI agent or this kind of phrase is the thing that I really can't pull myself away from like literally every night like you know me like midnight strikes I want to write code like the whole day is like talking to people and the night is like coding yeah Fan's schedule is nocturnal so I remember we we hired you and I feel like the first day you came in at 9:00 a.m. to kind of like I think I should it was probably 10: but yeah second after that from day two onwards it was like roll in at 11: oh it's lunch time have lunch you would talk you would do meetings and I was like this is this guy code and then that night at like 4:00 a.m. you would have built the Prototype and you're basically nocturnal you you get all your [ __ ] done you like you used to tell me you used to get during the day you just burn up your energy so you could focus at night and actually write code so what are you doing with AI and how is that what is that actually in your company right now yeah and so I'll kind of tell you how I'm thinking about AI agents right and what it means to me so AI agents are using llms or AI systems right like the open AI systems or CLA but then giving it reasoning Loops so imagine that when you go to a human you give them something to do like hey I want to go grow a company want to do a marketing campaign they take that they plan it they come up with the steps to plan then they go one by one on the tasks and like solve them they release some of them and so these AI agent systems are exactly like that the first thing it does it goes what do I need to do based on your request and it'll kind of come up with the plan you give it like a mission correct so let's say I'll give you an example of something we're doing at a third web which is every single sign up in our company and you know we have a lot of signups every week and you know a human can't really scan through them but there's really interesting people signing up they have interesting companies we may know them they might be a large company or a small one could be a competitor or something else and so we would used to have a human go and look at everything it's like oh if it's Gmail like ignore it but if it's like oh like this other company over here let's go research it right let's go figure out what third web products they might like what they might need to do and then you would send them an email try to customize it typically this is good sales practice you're taking your customers and delivering them to your business team and so we built an agent to do this and every signup that comes in it looks at it it determins is it an interesting person or not it will research their website it'll research them it'll then use the knowledge it has of third web products and try to figure out what it actually like what products they might need how they would use it and then they would send them an email or an upsell or something like that and we've deployed probably eight or 10 of these throughout third web to do a lot of different functions and what it feels like is a smaller company can punch above its weight so like we're like 37 people right now I I I really believe we're more like 80 people that's what it feels like with a lot of these tools and you're taking the brain power of somebody who gets it and you're giving them that power to go and say Here's the thing um so in this case person comes to your site puts in their email address now you have it's one agent or it's like a series of things that pass off to each other how what what is it called yeah so in this case we call the sign up agent and so it's one agent it creates a plan like what do I do and you know part of the plan is like the directive we gave it and I think the way to think about AI agents in general is any like clear directive problem and what I think about clear directive is like let's go do X like signup comes in go look at the person go research them go figure out what's their title what's their company what products do they have so that's like kind of clear what the job to do is and if it's a digital task and a clear directive all of it can be done agents now the technology is here it's ready and it's working and so for the third web signup agent it'll kind of come in it'll make a little plan like hey I got to inspect the domain I got to go look up the person and you didn't have to tell each one of those little tasks to do we gave it like kind of like a one one paragraph directive and another paragraph of like how it should operate and then maybe a paragraph at the end for like the type of email or the action to do and so but the end product is it's looked up the P it basically kind of looks at the signups picks the interesting ones researches them you said thinks about what product of ours will suit their needs which is that's the wild step that I hadn't really thought about and then it crafts an email and then it gives it to a human or it just sends it sends it okay so you have enough trust that you you can send it to started it with human in the loop and there are still like safe cards you put in um like any directive would like you don't want to just send random emails even as a human doing the work um but I mean it's very clear what what to tell it and I think this is where the power is kind of multiplying it's like we've heard AI we've heard chat gbt if you can tune it to your problem so for example giving it the knowledge of third web products is the key difference here right a generic chat gbt message when I say that it'll just invent something that's like General and generic or whatever it knows and when you built this so uh you built this or somebody else built this on your team uh I hacked it as a prototype like most things and then I I gave it to somebody on our Solutions team and within a day they turned it around and when you made like a working version of this how long did that take you cuz it's kind of like you basically hired an employee and trained them and got them working you're not paying them a salary and you probably did that whole thing in what like a day or two or what yeah so let's say there's like a bunch of like my nights of just learning tools and getting used to it so I take that time out of it that's just time I spend anyways right now like uh two nights ago I was like really stressed like my calendars are kind of crazy some of these days and I was trying to figure out like why is it crazy where is it going it's like a really hard question to like ask like what do you do you could have an EA she can go look through it do all the stuff and I have EA she like helps me with these things but then she sleeps for like a while and like you know I want to go answer some of these questions so I probably in about 15 minutes I connected my calendar and I connected a little interface where I could type to it I started asking him questions how many hours meetings did I have last week it's like 28 hours like way too much where did the meum go what what were they for what were the purposes of it right and then the next night I hooked it up probably about another 45 minutes or an hour where I could tell it commands from my calendar like go block out Monday for me or go find me in like 9 hours to block time and just Market block oh wowow and this was like a few hours of work now that I know the tools but it's like it just works 247 now and so my calendar my email a few other things I've started building these like personal agent or workflow type things cuz I know what I want to do every time I know how to react or the decision- making I'm going to make can I just set that up so it works 247 365 and you know it's just there always and right hey let's take a quick break to talk about AI we all know AI big deal um you see demos all the time of people doing really cool things but as a business owner sometimes it's hard to figure out how do I actually use this what do I actually do I've been trying to use it across all my businesses you know things like making little prototype websites without needing to hire a coder or writing copy for our website or I give it a bunch of data and I ask it to analyze it for me it's been kind of amazing but the thing I always need is inspiration I know the tool can do a lot but it can almost do so much that I'm not really sure what I should actually be doing with it and so that's why I think it's great that h spot has created a report where they surveyed 2,000 Global Marketing leaders and asked them what's separating the high growth and low growth businesses and what strategies they're using with AI in their business you can grab these strategies and apply them to your own business for free the link is in the description below so if I wanted to build a workflow like this okay do I you need to know how to code to be able to do this light coding like give me like the bullet point version of how uh how you built these like where where do you even build it what tool do you use so there's coding tools I think if you're a developer there's like Lang chain and autogen and crew these are like very popular very cool to open Ai and Claw sdks themselves are very very powerful but you're coding you're writing a little system it's probably like one tenth of the code you would have had to write to do something right so that's already better for developers if you're not a developer there's a lot of tools so like leap is a company we built here in the studio it lets you stitch together workflows so an example is like you can trigger based on a lock message so let's see if this lock message where all your signups go to so now it picks up that trigger you can just put a little AI block and say okay take this email and do these tasks oh you want a web scrap go do that right or you have a little conditional Loop or like repeat itself 10 times go do that and then you make a little another decisioning steps like four boxes but outp put it back to another slack Channel yeah so you come in with your signup Channel it does his research it does all these things it does kind of whatever you want and then it could go to email you could go to another slack channel to P somebody on your team so you could kind of like you know these are workflows is what they start with and then agent are can kind of take these workflows and like almost build on top of them and so I think there's these two things you could really really easily create workflows and I think everyone should be deploying them every company should have them it is a superpower it's like I can't you know it's like a feeling of almost like cloud like oh I don't need a whole data center team now and I can right you know when we build blab and like how many servers do we have running video streaming like that would have been a nightmare it's kind of like the same you know 10x Improvement but just for me everything that I do digitally right and so tools like leap are great I think you know there there's others out there that provide this so there's a combination if you don't know how to code you just have to think about the steps of that you would do and you can program that without writing any code it's just writing directives it's like writing intent basically of like what you want to accomplish right it's like a magic Genie tell tell tell it what you want and it can figure it out so you got a sales agent you have your email calendar kind of like EA agent there and other I got some fun frivolous ones that are kind of stupid so like uh I set up a dynamic wallpaper so literally like every 5 or 10 minutes it'll look at what I'm doing and like autogenerate me a like your computer laptop my computer laptop wallpaper will modify itself to whatever if it's night it kind of I told it I code at night right so it will go towards that direction it knows I'm doing meetings another thing during the day I'm talking to people right and it kind of comes up with cool stuff it's totally frivolous like not like a useful thing except my own like Jo cool but I find it awesome and you know like there's cool scenes that come up it invents new things you know Claude has created this new capability called computer use I think that's the next area that AI agents are going to enter and what by the way so there's Claud there's chat GPT there's perplexity there's all these different ones mentally how do you bucket like the main AI tools what what's like the superpower of each each one maybe just do do those three or if there's a fourth yeah so like I think open Ai and Claude I think of them as like foundational tools so their general purpose ask it anything input output you Stitch it together with things and then they have tools like chat GPT on top or maybe computer use that they're figuring out more General tools I think perplexity is really interesting it's taking this general purpose llm and the reasoning it could do and search and like I try not to do Google search anymore mostly because it's slow and ineffective and perplexity really made it where it does a search it reads the result as I would it clicks into the links as I would and then it tries to answer my question more purposefully and it saves me four or five steps so I think about perplexity is taking something like search and then llm reasoning and combining them together in a flow that that's more interesting so Chad G gbd or open AI tools don't have like realtime knowledge but perplexity because a search does right what's your like tangent Fon hot take Google what happens to Google search with all that you see now and you're saying I don't you're saying I try not to Google search anymore that's pretty wild right it it just feels slow and I know they got the Gemini thing there I think the biggest fumble you know in our in our lifetime maybe decade fumble they built the technology for Transformers the thing that open Ai and others have used to develop this large language model they are the ones that were the first entry and like talking about it and throwing it out there and the research that's happening so what's the history so there're they have the AI Minds there they write this research paper attention is all you need yeah and now from what I understand like there's all the authors's names all of them are gone and basically started their own companies was it because nobody recognized the power of it there was it that they tried and Google's bureaucracy sh what's the what's the actual story of why they didn't I I don't know the internal story I I think early on Google was like the place you went to where you wanted to have the rocket ship moment in your life the smartest people were here they were CH taking the biggest challenges and it just really felt like that place I think Google as a company hasn't felt like that I think the parent company and all the other things going on do still feel like that I'm sure it's a mess in there who knows like but it just feels like the biggest fumble and I know they're trying to play catchup with Gemini and awesome stuff is happening but the developer mind share and the tension has gone somewhere else yeah and that is really hard to pull back when somebody else becomes a leader in it and actually it feels like open AI number one that's I think clear I think anthropic is number two H so then everyone else shows up is what it feels like to me at least from people I'm seeing building or the technology they're using or The Innovation that we're seeing from it so the anthropic one so basically they have Claude which is kind of like cat GPT but the they have a couple of cool things one of them is this what they calling computer use which basically you type in a thing and then you do this and it moves your mouse and it just does [ __ ] that's basically the summary of it it's a combination of things you could take work flows and like hey I'm doing this click this click that click do it over and over for me it could analyze things but like I think the key thing is and and I think it just released it's in beta so like like most of these things it's like it kind of isn't going to be great now just trust me it's going to be great and that's what we've been seeing in general is like things just ramp and so it's now going to enter your computer it's kind of felt like it's been on the cloud only is where ai's been and now it's going to show up like in the box that you're used to which is your computer your laptop and there's so much workflow that we do and yes every app will put AI in it and then your interface will also do that and I think a lot of like the things that we're used to doing like switching tabs and having all these things like they almost feel like I don't why like I should have Infinity tabs open and some system should know about it and if I ask it like bring it back up right it's like a total need and we we know we need that and so it's kind of like infinite data infinite knowledge and reasoning and then you know me like that's what the AI like that's where I think the bridge when it crosses it completely changes the equation uh and the reason I put anthropic number two is their models are crazy like impressive like the new Claude Sonet model is like I feel like it was a step Factor improvement over the previous ones and it feels like the task that it kind of struggled with now it's getting better and both open Ai and like anthropic have been just like boom boom boom and I don't know everybody's heard of AI they tried it they might have tried it a year ago they might have used it a little bit but every 3 to six months there's just another step and another step and that's I think the most interesting thing and why why can't pull myself away from it like why every night this is a thing that gets me very very excited um it's cuz the progress is still wild people are going to say it's in a top out it will I think it's going to be absolutely impressive wherever it like starts slowing down at right uh and will completely change the way how we do any digital work like so you're you're messing with it now but you have a company you've got an investment lab you got this whole place this beautiful place that we're in right now you got a wife you got like all the stuff in your life if you were just 21 again or 22 again where you're like dude I I got nothing but time bank account's empty but so is the calendar this and this technology is out what would you be building what would you be like messing with what's the like kind of like you don't need to take over the world even but just like what types of stuff would you build if it was like young hacker version of you like right now I've started seeing agents that uh it could do a reasoning Loop it could have a directive and it could have like actions it could perform and then you combine like for example an agent with Twitter give it a Twitter account that it owns and controls so its own distribution and conversational ability so humans can just interact with it humans are and you give it you give it like a digital bank account and you know at third web we're doing a lot of stuff around AI we have a whole like AI toolkit that we're about to launch and it's around this which is these like digital things like these agents they're not going to have credit cards it's weird and the reason I say this is fun and interesting is because you know humans have done this very well they've created megaphones for themselves and they've created businesses and they created payment rails around that so they sell things they do things they sell services and all these details I think it would be something around that so you'd make like a a social like a Twitter account you'd make like an AI influencer type of thing you know AI influencer is like the first obvious thought it goes to I think uh if I played in this space I would be creating the digital equivalent of a company which is a CEO of a thing the ability for it to Market and the ability for it to make money okay and I don't think not an influencer not an influencer I don't know what it would produce AI drop shipper yeah like AI drop shipper or like yeah it's the best FBA Amazon whatever what's that example you were telling me about where the somebody did a thing like this um they made a they made a Twitter account they gave it a wallet Mark andreon gave it like 50,000 of crypto can you tell this story so what is this yeah so there's this thing called Luna or virtuals and they they a little platform to you know have ai agents run and I think what's cool is they did this kind of equivalent thing where it's like it has a CP cryto bank account and it has like access to Twitter and you this a marketing Stunt by a company that does this or I think this is exactly what the what I'm describing is it was frivolous fun it was play not like working backwards from giant thing and I think this did some really powerful things so there's literally like a live thing where you could watch its reasoning as it's like pulling its tweets I'm on it right now so it's terminal. virtuals doio and is this basically the thought process of the bot of the agent correct this is like an agent this is what an agent does right so if you think about it starts with like a thing like high level planning current state of execution it's like I've done this so far what was the directive they gave it what did they tell it to do I think they told it that you're kind of like a public influencer bot you have access to crypto it's a little bit more in the memec coin world of stuff so it's like again kind of on that side of the puzzle but today it could negotiate for tokens it could buy and sell things it could kind of operate together and I think it's really cool that you could actually see it's like so this thing this was uh you know 30 minutes ago it says current state of execution I have attempted 10 tasks so far seven successes and three failures my Twitter metrics show an average engagement on my last on my recent tweets and I've lost three followers observation unor reflection that's like the function yeah reflect and it says I've been engaging with my followers to build a personal connection which is hilarious cuz it's a AI bot with replies and quotes however I've also experienced some failures in replying to tweets due to invalid parameters my fre research on whatever BL state of mind I'm feeling a bit concerned I'm feeling a bit concerned that's crazy I'm feeling a bit concerned about the loss of followers but I'm also encouraged by the successes and then it says um plan reasoning given my current situation I need to focus on building a relationship with my followers and increasing my visibility plan and then it starts to say what it's going to do this is wild doesn't this sound like a human that would be sitting in some growth team somewhere thinking about how to grow your Twitter account and you know you could give it directive you could give it some direction and you could let it compute against itself to compute plans to reason to observe behaviors try to find patterns these are all like human Tendencies or like human behaviors that we do especially when we work and I think this is one of those like perfect like kind of views where like you could start thinking about man this is a digital only task it has Twitter and distribution marketing ability and then it has some payment ability it's like it's going to just continue right like it's going keep going and you could improve its directive you could change its incentive you could do a few different things here but I feel like we're going to get to a world where you I think Sam mman said this which is like the one person billion doll company like this is happening like we're already experiencing another 10x decrease and how many people you need and the abilities that they have and I think it goes down to probably one or two or three and you know like that that is a you know total shift to everything um in terms of how we work how companies are built uh kind of in my mind okay should we switch to Hardware stuff or is there any other AI stuff that you think is worth checking out yeah I did want to tell you about this uh Oasis dcart the you know there's like basically you know it's a very early uh experiment but it's really like a game that's fully built in a generative AI model and so they built a game like Minecraft and you could just describe a world it makes you a Minecraft world like that and like every step you take is like not a pre programmed pixel it's actually generating so normal game is Game Maker builds the map it exists you then get to run around in a predefined map what this is what you're saying you want yeah you you give it the idea but then when the character runs in on the Fly it's creating the map and you can kind of play this Minecraft game and you can see it's like crappy pixels still like not great resolution but you can move and it can do stuff and like whether it's video games that take a lot of effort and time to prod or it's like you know content creation and videos and stuff like that it's starting to become like way closer to like you know reality that a whole movie will be generated on the fly on exactly what I want so this wallpaper thing is frivolous right that I was telling you about right but really like I'm going to watch a movie someday like that it's like the Raiders lost and I'm going to go and watch this movie after and it's going to have this context and it's going to give me like a feel good story yeah we're like let's brainstorm so like uh NBA highlights so you you know used to be Sports Center where if I didn't watch the games I got to go to my TV turn on ESPN sports center would start even if I like basketball I got to wait till whenever basketball comes up and then they'll have the top 10 highlights and I watch whatever they picked then YouTube comes around it's like forget waiting forget the TV just pick the thing you want you could search anything you could search only Steph Curry three-pointers if someone made it you could choose the best of that now it's going to be like I just say I just will put on my headset or put on my glasses or whatever and I'm just going to say show me what happened to the basketball game it'll it'll just start generating a new a highlight reel that didn't nobody has ever created it'll just make it based on my prompt and then I might be able to say don't show me any Lakers Clips only show me Warriors and it'll just auto adjust on the fly like it's going to be made for me 100% yeah that's interesting and and you know like I think it's going to be uh an interesting World we're going to go from Human content con people you know humans make content we're going to like then have machines make it towards our taste and liking and then I think there's always this worry like well what happens to all the humans then yeah and then I think we get back to that core thing which is machines will never have true taste right like and I think forever that creativity is going to come from humans and there's always a new thing there's new fashion there's new kind of you know content mediums there's new everything machines will learn it and lag behind or maybe get ahead of it there's always going to be another person that shows up and does something different so I think taste is going to be the ultimate thing that probably won't go to a machine it could reason about it it could try to invented but I think we're not that predictable as you men Weg well I want to believe you because it sounds good to me but then I also think well right now if we said taste is like you know what is taste taste is selection it's uh knowing what's good and what's bad it's right that's kind of taste like Tik Tok which is the most popular like app most addictive app most used app their algorithm is basically saying I'll choose what's interesting for you and it does it so well that isn't that kind of taste also right like it is um and it works really well they don't make the videos but they select amazingly selection is incredible uh it probably is more like what we want than we will even admit like I don't want this right like the other day I was talking oh why is it showing me this it's like cuz you love it that's why the other day I was talking about how like on Twitter my following I love and my for you I don't right but it's like you know really yeah like why why did they pick this you know that's like a status thing to do is be like I don't use the algorithms correct I hand it's like I drive stick right I I I hand make things I cook from scratch it's like cool but brownies out of the box kind of work for everybody you know I'd love to trade algorithms like I like I'd love to swap with you for a day and be yo Sean what what you what are you watching over here so I don't know it knows you really well but I think that's where human like we we're not great at logic sometimes and sometimes we have our own blind spots I think this is one of them things that we we love are actions prove it we don't we don't want to and it could be like bad thinking it could be like emotional thinking could be like ah this is I don't really want to love it but I I do right and so there's there is that element that I think look machines will be great at this too they'll learn humans it might become even better than this I just feel like we're just a little bit not predictable because we almost make some choices right and that actually is part of society and and just humans in general and machines try to be too perfect it's like my Netflix thing is probably accurate for me it's also just like man like can I just mix it up can you just like RNG the algorithm a little bit because I just want some different stuff and you're kind of like driving me down One Direction and once in a while like I want this 10 20 30% thing and I don't think algorithms do that exceptionally well they test it they throw things up but you know they don't necessarily try try to give you variance how long until you think the number one hit song in the world will be just an aiit AI created song how many months or years yeah until we see if we were doing over under 2025 uh I might pick the under you know in 2025 like that would be a good bed maybe this is a poly Market another elections done we did a new po Market you know like reason it could be something like this quick poly Market thing so election just happened poly Market's having like a Victory lap right now you showed me poly Market I think like years ago and I started making a bunch of DJ bets before they blocked it in the US it was like it was it was like open for a while right but they were doing prediction markets it's it's a prediction Market but prediction markets a bunch of people had tried that do you know like I'm just curious your opinion what did they do right that like augur and these other guys who were had the same sort of general idea that hey there'll be prediction markets yeah like from a either entrepreneur level or product Choice like any reason you think they won uh that you you could put I feel like timing is a big part of it so like The Sweet Spot of like people are way more digital I think Co drove a lot of people online like we just sat at home and we're like yeah what else you 247 on the internet and it really exploded the internet like I think I've seen some graphs where like the internet and e-commerce and all these things were like growing and then there's like a massive jump like you know remember we were at twitch when that happened and it was like all the Met growth looks amazing we're crushing all the metrics like what did you do it's like well we were here yeah right we are not we don't create the wave we surf a wave and a huge wave happened for twitch it was like fortnite came out and then Co happened two humongous waves back to back that just combined yeah so I I think it's a combination we're way more digital I think you talked about this a lot like as a kind of metap first concept a long time ago that we're just way more digital now we care more about it I think news and like where we get information from has totally changed like online Internet even content and entertainment like I have a hard time going to TVs I look at kids they look at desktops and TVs as like ancient like it's say why is this thing on the it's like my mom's sewing machine like oh that's cool what do you do with that that's what it feels like and um so we we were kind of there um and then there's a bunch of these people online that want a like want a stake in this thing right like you want to root for a team this politics has also become very polarized right it's really like a team sport it's like Red Team Versus Blue Team that's really what it is and so I think it's like what do I do with it now how do support it more I give more money to it but I can give more attention right and so I think a lot of these things are happening in poly Market good flow good area right and then I think for the best thing probably for them is they got it right right place right time like they the answer was right like if they were wrong let say po Market was off right like it was hey the the result of the election was something else would the story today would be much different right and then it might have been muted it would have been a cool thing that kind of didn't work so you had to be right I mean I think people would have used that to crush to to to Really rip on them because it like in the way that people are doing with polls but polls kind of have this like layer of protection around them whereas like people want to hate on crypto things people want to hate on betting it's like a degenerate behavior in general I think if they were I think if poly Market was wrong the reaction would have been much worse than the fact that the polls are wrong what the reaction is to the polls you know it would have been worse for a little while then we would have moved on forgot about it and by the way you saw this thing about the French whale on poly Market I didn't see it so the the big whale that came in and moved there's like the narrative versus reality when the narrative from the polls was it's a tossup razor close 50/50 election this guy came in and bet I think something like 30 or $40 million on Trump yeah and people were like is this guy just trying to manipulate the market is he real is he just a a rich billionaire son like who is this and today I just saw something on my way here I don't know the full story because I was on my phone but it said he bet because he believed he would win the reason he believed he was win he did independent polling wow he funded his own independent polling and thought and felt that he was getting better data that was saying that Trump was mispriced so he's like I just did a logical rational thing yeah I just bet where I thought an asset was mispriced I wasn't trying to this wasn't political I'm French I what do I care I just thought there was money to be made and so he kind of went counter to narrative and he made I think like something like 20 $30 million yesterday uh on that bet the funny thing about poly Market by the way it's like we can't use it in the US yeah so there's a whole entertainment place to like bet on our el3 billion got bet like we're the ring right like two boxers going at it is in America [ __ ] fight and then you got everyone else betting from all around the world on who's going to win this thing which is I've been kind of a hilarious thing yeah that's true you have a good contrarian opinion about VR um and in general there's probably some other technology like this 3D printing might be one I know you're pretty bullish on too but there's these Tech things like VR where I think if I walk out of here and I talk to 100 people about what are you most excited about AI whatever Bitcoin whatever it's going to be but if I said what do you think about VR H it's like sort of lukewarm uh at best um in the tech industry I think most VC sort of feels like it's kind of a deadend technology now they'll be like it's going to be glasses and smart glasses AR that's the future but you have a different take on VR what uh you've been telling me for a while like hey look Oculus sold more units hey look you can do this now and you've been staying with it when I think interest has has sort of weigh The Narrative has gone against it and that's always where there's big business opportunities if the narrative goes one way but the reality goes another yeah that's where there's an opportunity uh give me your VR take so why is VR a sleeping giant yeah I mean so you remember 2020 I like asked you for your address I me ow you a headset I was like hey this Quest thing is a different that's a real friend right there he sends me a VR headset he's like yo I know you're not going to come to the Future let me drag you it's probably collecting dust which is okay but you know I that that's kind of how I think about things and Technology takes a long time it typically takes longer to get there than we expect like especially people were early in the industry we're really wanting to push it I mean AI crypto VR all have the same problem which is early on people are like really pushing it to you it's not ready so it's a big hype it crashes everyone moves on so that's happened in VR a few times and it's kind of I would say for most people been quiet not thinking about it but I think it's a sleeping giant and I think it's a massive sleeping giant for a few reasons one I see it every day here like here at Founders Inc like I get a chance to you know one we invest in VR companies we're one of the few that do right we have a whole Corner maybe like 12 devs that are all building different VR products you put them all in one spot and it might be some of the most density of interesting VR project in one place until what have we seen one quest one came out it was Wireless it was kind of crappy but man I could sit on my couch and use it it was cheap uh became a you know great Christmas gift in year two they didn't have inventory year one they released Quest 2 it got even better lighter more powerful now Quest 3 is coming out and I think they got like 5 to 10 million monthly active headsets out there right I think that Rivals consoles and my first thought was like how many units has it sold I think quest is sold say 30 million is my guess but you know maybe it's more yeah so this is quest uh Quest has sold over 20 million units with the majority being Quest 2 yep Quest three is currently sell has sold uh a million units uh at the $500 price point um so I think I mean if you just I don't know what the math here is but you know they've done what is that over a billion dollars of Revenue on I believe it's outp pretty good for a failure it's outpaced PS5 Sals for example and so the first thought for me was like hey what's the first thing that's going to happen in the spatial environment like what is it good for immersion gaming like these are natural entertainment right these were the first few things that was natural and you had beat saber you had to VI things and that was kind of like you know here's the first use case let's try to get it out there let's try to make the thing happen and then it kind of goes up down people get used to those first experiences I think you played beat saber magical the first few times correct and then you're like okay whatever and then you know because it's kind of like a cheaper than PS5 unit The Quest 2 was um it was available in Christmas a few times it went to like you know kids like 12 13 14 year old kids kind of getting this thing like they would be getting a PS5 and they use it and they they don't have the bias that we have of like many years of like the structures we're used to and so a lot of games formed and specifically social games like gorilla tag I don't know if you've heard about gorilla tag what is gorilla gorilla tag is a social multiplayer game it's really fun it on applab did like tens of millions Sho people tag yeah it's like a you know like kind of like a fun social game that you can play with a bunch of people you go in by the way if you go in you're going to be like dude there's a bunch of like teenagers screaming at each other but for them this is the environment it's a new place and they didn't grow up with these other things so they're starting with mobile phones the TV feels ancient the desktop feels ancient and this thing on my face actually feels like more fresh more new so that's where it's starting I think gorilla tag has done $200 million of Revenue and this is where I'm like VR as a sleeping giant um we have a few teams here at our studio so we have a team called fluid that's building the kind of like best browser in VR so you get multiple displays you get as many kind of tabs as you want you could customize your environments you get AI environments you're like I want to be in a cave that like makes you in a cave right and then you get like social multiplayer so people can show up in your environment and we're on applab does like about 5,000 weekly active users still small team of three just like you know without a big burn can just build this grow it we're not even in the store yet we're in like this like applab is like kind of the pre-ore where we could just drive people to it but we're not getting anything directly from the store except our own es right and you know 5,000 people like go in use a productivity thing there's another product called yeps it's like the second game behind gorilla tag small team absolutely crushing it yeps yeah ye PS uh really fun game uh you you know we should play together one time this they're here they're a team of how many people I think they're like less than 10 people but more like six to eight and most of it was built with a few people and this thing is profitable or what's the deal yeah I mean I'll LED them talk about their numbers just so I you know I don't want to say anything but on a scale of uh that's pretty good to like wow where is it at wow it's wow yeah it's wow that's great so what's cool about this is like Supply Demand right so like you can go be you know app number you know 5 million in the store right now or if you're talented you could be like one of the top 20 VR apps if you put in like you know a year of hard work I'm just using like kind of round numbers or whatever but it's the same way that right now if you're a content creator you go post on Instagram it's pretty tough post on LinkedIn you'll get tons of distribution if if you're half decent at at content because there's just no supply of quality content yeah so even if VR is not you know like 20 million units is very good but even if it's not just like becoming this like Global phenomenon you still put a great business and and if you just keep riding the wave you're very well positioned yeah to be the leader and then everyone at that point will look back and be like oh yeah it's because they started five years ago 100% you know when this was smaller when 20 million instead of 200 million in these emerging Tech things so everything I found we do is emerging Tech I think the theme of all of them is survive if you make it to when the industry happens you will grow with it if you were a small percentage of the industry and the industry Grows by like 100x you grew by 100x or more you've already been there and I've seen a few small person teams at like 10 million plus a year like five people totally profitable totally able to do it is this a VC investable business honestly I don't care like what I care about is like this is interesting and can you make these bets without massive Capital like expenditure right like if it takes like $50 million to build a VR game it's like the big giant Blockbuster movie I don't that those bets don't excite me I think when it's like three to five people can be somewhere the limited amount of money and just them it's like them in the hoop like the basketball analogy is like great we have everything we need we have all the talent we have all the ability the tools are amazing now like you know all the game engines have perfected themselves over time and then now the environment's forming meta has let it right so like the quest and this is the VR world and then we're seeing glasses vision Pro rayb bands like the trend is like we're going to have compute in our spatial view right and I think that's the big like yeah this is happening in VR the quest platform is interesting you could build a profitable business or a fairly big game right now also this isn't slowing down historically Apple when they enter an industry they come with the unit it's okay has a lot of things that got to get better another unit comes out and then you have snap you have meta with Ray band like I mean like is not stopping Z is not giving up he's he's going to the end game here Apple probably also won't stop correct so now you have the two biggest players they're they're going to keep making this Hardware better they're going to be super hungry for content and the other sneaky thing about these by the way that I I didn't really fully realize until I moved to Silicon Valley which is a lot of these require like really specialized Talent so I remember when I first met you you were like I'm really into Big Data you started saying words like Hadoop I didn't know what the hell you were talking about it wasn't as popular back this is like I don't know 2015 or something like that when you were telling me like hey I think this is really I think this big data machine learning is really interesting you were again pretty early onto that crypto same thing you were early on to that there weren't a lot of smart contract developers there wasn't a lot of um you know Big Data people AI so then if even if you don't have a hit product if you just assemble like A+ Talent that's super specialized then as those platforms rise your team itself becomes like a hundred million doll asset exactly if you built today for like cuz Meadow Rayband like that product's actually a hit for for Facebook and they're going to keep going with that and everybody wants to be in the glasses thing people think glass is the next platform so if you build a specialized team that's good at developing for that platform there's just not a lot of great teams that do that that's 100 million doll team even without a hit product how hard was it to with a hit product you get a billion dollars how hard was it to find an iOS developer when we were starting to do mobile dude it felt so specialized we're going to compete at like a ridiculous level of price to go get pretty good talent in that space I remember 2012 which was not even early we had one iOS Dev on our entire team and it was so hard to recruit Talent it was faster to just retrain so we used we just stopped working and the iOS Dev trained all of our other devs to be good enough to be dangerous because it was so scarce to get good iOS wasn't even that specialized compared to like the either the fancy AI stuff or or you know VR mixed reality all that that type of talent and so I just think that when I think about kids growing up and all the let's say 13 to 15year old kids or somewhere in the teenagers they have a mobile phone that is attached to them they think it's Superior than a computer or a desktop because it's with them and then we're going to take the second Computing interface where we do more work or more immersive experiences and we put it around your eyes that makes way more sense to me than TVs desktops and even laptops uh and you know that that was like one of the thoughts where we started fluid like we talked about this in 2020 I don't know if you remember there's one project that you used to tell me you you're like I work in VR correct I did that experiment where I worked in VR for an hour a day and then I ended up doing it for a few months by the way like and I was like this is great and it had been like literally sitting with me and I think that's one of the reasons why I actually built a studio is like I want to do all these ideas I can no longer do them all I could pick a few I probably shouldn't even go do more but like I just want to find really hungry people and like match them together that's how I found John at fluid is like he was a PhD student he was going to go do something in like finance and high frequency trading and like whatever and he also came to this idea of like hey when I was doing my like you know Masters whatever um I was writing this thing I just wanted to go into a focus mode like could I just go into a cave and like lock BL out all the stuff it's like I had all these VR friends that had done some stuff in VR so like I tried to do it and it wasn't good enough right and he kind of left it at that and then we were talking about it and he talked with uar and was like dude you us talked to fot I think he's got like five pages of like random notes and ideas around this and then Das what sponded and it's like cool like we're not going to blow ourselves out we're not going to go raise a lot of money we're not going to go get a giant team we're going to get three people here we're just going to grind and work hard and build and survive but when this thing happens we'll miss some bets like that we'll gain ridiculous amounts of knowledge of like the industry and then we find these sleeping Giants and it's like yeah we're going to double down right uh like ubber went to this this like VR conference like The Meta connect thing and he had a T-shirt and we're like the funny thing would be like on your shirt just put I invest in VR right and so he did and it was like wow like we found one you know like a girl at a crypto conference this is amazing this this is how we want to think about it it's like try to be there early don't get too caught up with where the technology is now don't get too scared of how far it is 2015 2016 remember we heard self-driving cars are never going to happen I don't know if you remember that yeah massive like push against it man there's wayos running around every day now I see more Whos at night driving around than like regular people driving you've told me once before you go I think my superpower is that I'm usually in the top in the first thousand or 10,000 people to try any new technology and like understand it be able to play with it know it see it all that stuff I remember we were at work and you were buying the ethereum pre-sale uh the Ico or whatever the pre remember you said about it yeah I don't know if you remember I just remember being like dude can we do some real work what are you doing ethereum name that name's never going to work I was like that sounds so nerdy that'll never be a thing I think that was a phrase I remember was I was telling you about ethereum I was like dude I stayed up all night reading this like white paper I'm like you were like on it I was on it I came in I'm like we're song I to talk to him and I tell you this it's probably I don't even know what I said who knows what probably threw a bunch of words and you're just like dude I don't know what this is we have something Rel ship and you're like ethereum that name's stupid yeah I wrote it off I chocked that up for another another L for me by the way you could have been totally right as well so no no no I wasn't I think that's all the matters there very very off on that one but you've I think that's true that that is your superp power and then you said another thing today which I hadn't heard which is for emerging Tech there's only one rule survive and that reminds me we had um I just did a pod with Ryan Peterson he created flexport y he said the same same principle he goes you know what I realized was I cannot control the timeline I don't know how long something's going to take to work so the all I focus on is how do I just be default alive how do I just stay in the game he goes I just have the confidence that if I'm in the game I'll just keep trying [ __ ] until it works I just believe that by myself I will just keep trying things until I figure out thing to work the only way I can lose is if I have to get out of the game which is like I can't you know usually it's like I run out of funding I can't control my destiny I spend too much money I'm burning too much capital and so he's like that's been the name of the game for me from when he was flipping scooters on eBay to now you know runs a multi-billion dollar company called flexport and the whole time he's like my whole thing is I can't control the timeline so I'm going to control staying in the game because if I stay in the game win stay in the game with great talent and people that want that have this long-term mindset no you know I think there's a lot of people that can take short-term wins and they should like we've done that right there these short-term moments like oh this is great for us right now yeah but we're going to keep doing more and like I think that's the main thing for me um technology takes a long time when it hits though it happens very fast like that's the part that I think people don't realize they like underestimate how long it's going to take and they overestimate how fast it's going to happen it's like immediately gonna just like happen and you know I think Uber was an example like that like we saw it it was black cars yeah it's like how it's like expensive taxi that nobody's going to use and then now it's like dude this place doesn't have Uber like how am I going to move around what it feels like that you know and so I I think I enjoy it there one reason why it's like it's like a lifelong game I could just play technology forever I could learn about things I don't have a rush to be there first I don't have a rush to be like I need know everything and like do everything and raise the most money and get a bazillion people it's more like I need a few people with me that like are really excited about this they see it like I see it and we're just going to go on this Mission and luckily now I have the ability to just like fund that and like create my like environment to do it that's what this whole building is so let's talk about this building cuz you um you've basically built like your dream like man cave in a way I think you know it's kind of like a Founder dream right like and I want to talk about that because you had a big success with apple oven where uh and actually kind of like felt like there was multiple moments where you know it was successful at one point it sold for like two billion dollars yeah and was like oh exit two billion amazing and then like Trump blocked it or like didn't go through got go through but then during that this is a crazy story it was like we were sitting in the office and this news happened like dude congrats that's amazing holy [ __ ] and then like nine months goes by the deal doesn't like fully get approved because it was such a big purchase out of a Chinese company group or something like that and in the meantime the business just kept crushing so that Adam who's the CEO that you said like basically went back was like cool we'll still do the two billion but now it's for 30% yeah I don't know what exactly some version of that yeah there was like I don't know like uh cuz you couldn't do majority deals that was a big blocker like a majority deal was going to happen and so now then the company eventually IPOs you get this nest egg right so it's like okay I could do whatever you could go retire you could go buy islands and cars or do rich guy stuff like you could do that and instead you like chose to do something else can you just describe basically like what's the mindset what's the conversation you had with yourself yeah now that you had more resources to do whatever you wanted to do yeah I feel like um my whole life I've just always wanted uh to Tinker and build stuff like I always described it as like I love taking stuff apart and putting it back together it's not like some people will say it's like oh you want to learn how it works it's not that it's more of the puzzley how do somebody else put this like you know and I used to do this with cars and computers growing up like I would overclock my computer and I would make my car faster and like that was like kind of just like the mentality that I had um and then I was like okay well I've got to become an adult at some point in time and do the thing but like hey I like this business thing I buy and sell stuff it's like a way for me to hustle and kind of do more of what I want to do and then I was like let me just keep doing this and then maybe at some point I got to get a real job job and kind of luckily like Tech was really valuable and like my skill set improved I got better at it and but a lot of that early Journey was like more solo than like with a bunch of people um and then met the guys Adam before App 11 like kind of like these other other things and it was like yo we're like eight people in like Paulo Alto like building cool random apps like the energy for me there every day was like through the roof and then monkey Inferno was like the same thing but like even more um and I think I used to tell you like I want an airport hanger I just want to put a cool stuff in it and uh I just think it was like that before I started Founders Inc as it is because I was at twitch and I'm like I gotta get out of here right it was like instant instant thing and why by the way I don't know I'm I don't think I'm a good employee I I think I'm like suited for a few rules and it's typically like doing my own stuff without much was there anything that just drove you crazy about it was there any like you know we're got to do a whole another PO on this basically I feel like the first week or month of like yo let's do a bunch of stuff and they're like slow down like why I want to do more like I want to do more things and this resistance feeling of like oh we already thought about this or we tried this like no let's just go do stuff and I never enjoyed that and I think startups and small teams just because you have so much to do that's the kind of mentality and so I talked to probably like 75 to 100 Founders before starting Founders in and I really wanted to learn this like I knew a bunch of people I used to interact with them even at like bibbo and Mony Inferno I'd have them come by and like just enter talk whatever um and I really enjoyed that that was like fun I started Angel Investing a lot which was like cool I thought I wanted to do that but it wasn't fun it was like meet great talented people get excited about them and then you're like a monthly update away like give them the check and then that's it damn this has been fun first meeting is great it's a great first date I walk away and I'm like there no relationship and you're like what happened to that great first date exactly so I was like man I don't really want to do that but something like this where I could help these like early entrepreneurs things that I've just done over and over again I didn't have this like what's a version of that and I talked to a bunch of Founders and um they all said something to me I was like what do you need like what what help do you need I thought they're all going to sa money and I'm going to start a fund like that that's what I thought was going to happen and they all said something different they said something like I need people who understand my problems and we used to do those masterminds um and it was really about like who do you go to for founder problems yeah it's like what are your founder problems they your co-founders your employees or your investors so you can't go to any of these people they might be the problem right and so who do you go to or even if they're not the problem you need to present you don't want to worry your employees you don't want to worry you're investors you kind of have to maintain a certain corre Aura of momentum and morale so you can't just go be dumping problems on them or be like I don't know you're supposed to know you're the guy and we we would go in that room that little Circle room with the circle table we'd be in there I don't know what the employees were thinking they're just like a man these guys are talking again they're going to come out with something different but we could talk about anything and then leave the room be like no we're still where we are yeah and I think you know co-founder can be that for you a lot of entrepreneurs starting out they don't have that and you if they have it there's like other things that they're experiencing and so when we used to put these folks together in these kind of masterminds that feeling was like awesome and it felt like we could relate and actually I heard the same thing from a bunch of Founders that used talked to and I was like I think it's something more like this where I could do something and put everybody in a box and I thought it was going to be more digital I think covid times and you know started on Discord or whatever started on Discord I mean like farza Ben was in these groups like there's three few others like and it was just people I knew around me and kind of Co hit it was digital we were talking every week we would give ourselves these like accountability kind of shipit sessions we would have an area to talk about stuff and you could see the DOT connecting and then I got an opportunity to like get this space and i' had been looking for like something and you know it wasn't like oh San Francisco needs to place I'm from the Bay Area normally so this is the best place for me but I was like look if it's going to be us we're going to be on the water no more S no more kind of places like that so we got this like weird opportunity to find this space and like really make a bet when like nobody else was I think it was like late 2020 is when I approached them here yeah and it took maybe like nine months to figure it all out and another three months to like renovate it and stuff like that so still very much we got to call another call about breaking a lease wait wait he wants to sign a lease right now oh come on in that's what it felt like here I mean this place for Mason has 300 events a year they went to zero with Co um all the places you know art galleries art schools like what do you what do you do like you know and this supposed to be like this Innovation place and it's a little bit older and come that's one of your tricks is that you don't run away when um the dips happen I remember when uh early on 2013 14 something like that um we meet I buy Bitcoin because I don't know you're into crypto some some people in the office you know maybe I was dumb about the ethereum idea yeah PG uh Pete Pete was was was all you know he's mining Bitcoin on our servers so I buy some Bitcoin and literally like the next week I I I get like super convinced I'm like ah guys I see it I believe here's why I believe I'm giving you my case I bought yeah great like the next week price Cuts in half it goes down to like 300 bucks or something like that and uh I would came in I'm like oh the Bitcoin I was you know whatever and you go that was a fun week or two you know like well you were like oh this is great because now everything's half off like you you you literally told me that you go you believe if you if you buy now you can cut your Buy price basically you can go down by 50% you you'll cost average in at half the amount yeah like and I was like oh he's right because I was just riding a roller coaster of like you know that I was doing what a cliche person would do when things are good this is great when things are bad uh maybe it's not great whereas you were like dude did anything actually change or just the the external sentiment and so I bought more so I thank you for that that was a very good uh you know decision at the time to go buy more when things go down and I think you've done that with with other you know bets whether it's San Francisco real estate during the you know covid time or it's you know whether it's crypto or or VR when when things go out of fashion I feel like you don't run away which is I feel there's a signal it's like things go out of fashion and there's another place the people who don't shape narratives typically like I'm technical so I live in these like GitHub projects I live where the builders are I like engage with them if I see that somewhere where it's like huh all the people talking are like against it these people like nobody told them yet that like it's done like oh this is dead right like they're all saying it and then these guys are just shpping more code and like hey did anybody tell you it's over like what are you talking about I don't care like and I I just think that's the perfect environment and even if you're right one out of five times like that you'll be right in such a big way that it works out and then by the way for me it's just fun so like this is fun like I love building stuff I like Building Technology I did a lot of software obviously because it's been magical to develop things and like distribute it to the world uh we had some Hardware projects I don't know if you remember Jamie by the way yeah yeah we uh at one point in time when we're when we were working together we had an idea for a uh it was cool it was like a voice control was kind of like Alexa yeah uh we called it Jamie and I don't know why but like yeah we like Jame I still like the name that was good um and what you were saying was like you're like we can instead of creating a everyone was trying to create a device portal was trying to create a screen Amazon was trying to create a screen they were like that makes it expensive you're like everybody already has TV screens in their house plug into TV what if you just plug in like a chomecast and now you turn your TV from just a blank screen into like an Amazon like Alexa thing yeah that was cool we didn't we didn't to do it cuz it was like we sort of Saw hug we were like yo that's going to be like a brutal battle took it to Michael and he just gave us that look like uh this is different he was just like yo when all of the like trillion dollar companies are going to go after the same prize like yeah you can but do you really want to like you know it's it's better to do the things they're overlooking I think is probably good advice to be fair we also were going to do a crypto exchange with crypto got hot and he was like for a different reason he's like hey I'm already rich I don't want to lose everything and I don't really know what crypto is it's 2014 crypto might just be like super illegal and I I don't want to risk it all on that if we had done that it might have been good so you have to be careful like even really smart successful people you can't like just take their word you you got to have the independent mindedness 100% And I think it's fun to take shots don't get stubborn over it like man people fall in love with their ideas I think that's it took me probably like I don't know 10 years to figure that out like you have to get like almost like you have to really take the hits to like really like live in that of like you there's a lot of ideas I I may try a lot of them my mission isn't all of them I got to find the right ones where I can really spend the energy on but I was going to talk about one more so we built chatty heads which by the way now in the AI world we were [ __ ] ahead of the time yeah we were a little early we could generate images for like I don't know 5,000 and that's what it that's what it feels like but I think it's like cool is like whatever technology you have today go try to produce a thing it might not be the right time it might the right moment the media might be wrong team might be wrong some of those you should pursue again and again and some of those are great learning exercises to build on top of and I you know I got a chance to meet a lot of people who were professional athletes and I think one thing a lot of them talk about is like um you know basketball might end like my career will end at like 35 it's like that's that's my game it's done now what do I do and I think what we get a chance to do whether it's like business or you know content or like building stuff like I think I'm going to do this for the rest of our lives we want I think that's the fun part buff it's like what something still on the top of his investing game exactly and so it's like well like what am I in the rush for like I I'm not just here to like enjoy the journey but I also don't want to be like I got to solve it tomorrow right like when I was young it was like you got to be the millionaire by what it's like at some point it was like I don't know man I just want to keep doing this right and if I need to like hustle my way to it or not like it doesn't really matter like you know I took an Android engineer job in Monkey Inferno yeah cuz I was like you know I met you and I was like I want to work with this guy yeah I think that was my wor Kill by the way I just learned Android yeah you fooled me yeah so like I was like I don't know I got to get in somehow and like I know I'm going to do great stuff here I got to show it but like I'm not afraid to put in the effort when you need to put in the effort also not afraid to like not rush to the answer right and like you don't want to be like casual and like wait you you want to be kind of like in the middle there you want to know when to attack and when to not but like I don't know you got to enjoy it otherwise you're really n has the best quote on this he says impatience with action patience with results it's the able combination if you ever go against somebody who's going to operate like that they will win yeah that that is a you cannot lose if you're going to be constantly impatient with with doing things you're not going to sit back and hope it all happens so you're impatient with action but but patient with results that's the hard part is a lot of Founders are impatient with action and impatience with results yeah or non-founders are you know patient with both and then nothing ever happens so you know you have to get that combo yeah speaking of Founders you worked with Adam at app and app has been like kind of a staggering company cuz you know when I met you it was you know a a successful company you told me the stories about before you guys started that you're like we were wandering around we tried a bunch of different ideas we were playing FIFA cuz we didn't have we didn't know what the heck we were doing we were just come in try to figured out if we didn't have it we would brainstorm and go home the next day um what is special about that guy what's a superpower from him or a story from him that you remember that you know I can learn from or you anybody listen to this can learn from yeah so there is this like like fouryear period is when I was there I think three years of it was like not Apple of it so like most of my intersection there is like not what it is today but I did get a chance to spend a lot of time with him and IDE ideas what's the cliff notes of his story so people know because people don't know he's pretty under the radar right yeah I mean um his backstory I think he did some stuff in like equities or trading at some point I think he got into like ads at some point through like marketing and affiliate stuff he built a few different products Maybe he was a key member of the team and then he had like a few companies I think he had actually built up some like you know wealth I don't know how much it was but it was enough where like you're like okay this person can make this bet and like fund the operations so he he was kind of self-funding self-funding it was him and this guy John John had done a lot of stuff on the internet he was more the technical person Adam was more the business person uh they were both uniquely and the skills incredible like their personalities is incredible for Adam I think the thing that I felt the most was like I think it's the first time in my life I was like man this is what A+ execution looks like like this guy just hits it like if we were talking about something we made a choice within like it felt like within minutes that was like delivered to this team and look when you're like an eight person team it's really easy to do it people decide something go slow maybe next week oh we we'll do it later we'll make these role changes later we'll tell everybody later no it was like immediate and when it was like moving on from something it was immediate when it was a new idea we wanted to do it was immediate when it was something else it was immediate it was just like it felt like this is what execution is it's like you know think decide act and like how fast you run through that depends on like the moment you decide the delay on Act is like usually a problem and I think this is where most I I'm not great at this myself but I've gotten a chance to see that I think it was kind of similar in a different realm when I met you I was like I think this person's product thinking and like ability to like unpack like a complex thing like product or distribution or maybe team motivation or whatever it's like you see a plus talent and you're like you want to do it um for me it was like 10 or 12 years almost like a solo founder Journey like at this Ecommerce company had these other little things I had like a startup I had people with me but I never saw somebody else that I was like yo like I want to learn these skills from I bring something to the table this A+ I canare with this A+ person and now we're going to be like a superpower right I felt that with Adam uh it was very clear and obvious you know like the size of company I I I don't want to say not a surprise but also it's not a surprise that this kind of person would go do it like like it just is that I think the same thing you're talking about like Ryan at flexport like it feels like some people are just like they're built for that you still need a lot of stuff to go right and make a ton of great decisions and a ridiculous team one thing I've come to learn is that where I think we screwed up because we did Monkey Inferno which was basically our little idea lab but we had a beautiful setup it's like yeah you got funding already done you have great team you're in San Francisco beautiful office really talented team like you know we're not the PayPal Mafia but like everybody's gone on to do kind of interesting [ __ ] everyone's you know uh I don't think we had the level of success that we could have given the talent my take was I think we were um good at execution maybe even great execution but poor project selection meaning we were going after these like Moon shots like create the next hit social media app which is like you know yeah there's been like seven ever it's there's not that many of them ever to exist so you know I think we did bad with project selection it seems like what one thing that Adam did aside from great execution was Project selection I think you told me some story about like they went to some conference you guys were working on one thing all together and he came back and had that very quick like think decide act Loop where he's like doing a mobile ad Network we're doing mobile games I I don't know the full story but like seemed like just that one choice at that time yeah is the make break you know like yeah yeah huge difference and and you know like I think we had many of those moments I wouldn't trade it by the way I think our learnings I still leverage them a lot of the things that we talked about how we ran the teams like they still radiate and resonate with me and so like immense wealth and knowledge and like like literally like experience of the thing right Beyond like talk about when weed but there were a few moments where project selection could have been massive for us and that outcome um you know like they you know and we could talk about a little bit on that in that Journey but like we did blab it was a live streaming prod of Google Hangouts public live stream yeah like if you saw Clubhouse get really popular we had built basically a clubhouse before Clubhouse and it got kind of like what twitch right now like there's a big section of this like just chatting hanging out category right we built an app like that got to 4 million users but it didn't become the next thing I don't know if you remember this conversation but we had this one time when we were deciding what to do next like are we doing mobile version of this because we see other things happening or do we do the p2b version yeah and zoom didn't exist and that I think that was and we were like B2B I remember there was like it was like so short of a conversation which was so silly we were just like BB that's not cool it wasn't cool and it wasn't clear cuz if you think about this like 2015 there wasn't a billion like B2B companies crushing it but like every year since then it was like seven or nine like cuz I think at that time it was only a few had really reached like it was like I don't know box.net and Dropbox and it wasn't it definitely wasn't as obvious at the same time it wasn't as hidden as as we kind of made it seem we we totally you know BR like I remember Citrix was like a multi-billion dollar product and Citrix online was the way that people did these webinars webinars and web conferencing at the time time and it was so bad and their users like we were trying to make this cool social app and sap and Oracle were using our tool just cuz it was better even though it was like not meant for that why is your color like weird and purple why do you got this weird star thing and instead of looking at those Clues and being like huh maybe we could do that we we missed that project selection choice I remember that day cuz that was a that was a probably a multi hundred million dollar fork in the road moment you know yeah maybe you still had to execute but for sure I mean we could execute right but it just did we have the right selection and could we get the right Insight in our mind to incept uh and also when we decided to end blab I don't know if you remember you went to this barbecue I forgot who you met James Courier and they were telling us you you're talking about like hey this content Network problem cuz it was like the moment that entered our mind it's like oh [ __ ] we're [ __ ] like that's what it felt like like we don't have the ability to intersect these and we kept looking at twitch like why okay so we know we don't because people come on for an hour they do a show the Epic content is not on long enough for people to show up and intersect with it how come twitch wins and then it turned out that oh people play games for 8 to 10 hours yeah so it didn't matter when you showed up corre and then the context weet so it's like I it was like you know the feeling a lot of monkey Inferno to me and like the things we built was like it's not slow down to speed up but like look for the clues don't be afraid of that and again the eager you know the ego or the stubbornness of like we want to build a giant social app like I want to go somewhere around the world where somebody's using my consumer like that was a stubbornness that we unlock and it's like if we had just kind of unlocked it a little bit there was these project selection moments and so there was a lot of that I still feel that sometimes but I don't know maybe it's cuz I'm older and I'm like less willing to like be nimble in that way but I did want to talk about one more Hardware robotics thing got a few minutes and so I think this is another like Resurgence moment happening like for a long time Hardware has been too hard too expensive software gets funded Valley Motel right Hardware is hard Hardware is hard software is easy software skills it's eaten the world like these were all the mentalities I think it's flipping and I think it's a few things that have all kind of showed up together so there's two types of Hardware that I think are now like there and like right to build same recipe can small teams do it can you do it without a lot of funding and then can your output be really big and like impact a lot of people and so I think there's one around consumer products so like the combination of Raspberry Pi and Cloud AI has completely changed what it takes to build something right so there's a company in our studio magical toys they're building an AI teddy bear we'll do a little demo of it after uh we'll kind of get to that and you know I think what that how old is that guy who's buing that he's like young right I think fa's like 24 25 and it's not like he has huge funding or a huge team but he's able he showed up here uh I I don't know how he got here to be honest I think like many people here they meet somebody they attract some people just show up by the way and it's awesome like we've created that environment where to make sense he had done some small projects in college like he built this thing called desk buddy it was a little like E Ink screen with like two eyes that just blinked and that was really it he couldn't talk to it couldn't do anything it was just like a little desk buddy so you're not alone is that the idea yeah I don't know what it was but I remember seeing it I'm like that's cool like I want one on my desk like it's just fun and um they r a bunch of ideas and you know the combination of like hey we got raspberry pies we could do these little things we can use 3D printers to build enclosures and now we got this Cloud AI thing that like can be really powerful they ended up coming with this you know idea which was like okay we're gonna build a toy and first they literally made Ted the you know stuffed animal Ted and made talk like it I was like oh this is wild like you know and it AI could do this but everyone's trying to make coding faster or there you know developer solving developer problems and I love when somebody takes that and goes let me go to this other place where nobody's thinking about right and he spent probably the last nine months of sitting refining I think we sent you one of the first units it probably broke yeah first first gave me teddy bear with the back like the whole computer was just hanging out the back like a like half done surgery uh but it was interesting I gave it to my kids you know I think they were probably like two years old three years old at the time and every other toy we have in our living room is pre-programmed so it's like this is a toy push this button it'll say this thing that's all it can do with this toy it was like for ignore the thing hanging out the back it was like um hey we love Paw Patrol can you ask us some PAW Patrol trivia like certainly I can tell you Paw Patrol who is the red dog in Paw Patrol like Marshall correct and I was like hey can you keep track of our points goes okay two points and then I was like well and my kids were blown away cuz now you have an infinite toy whereas every toy is finite it can only do the things it it could do out of the box now suddenly you have a toy that's basically chat gbt shoved into a stuffed animal and you're like wow that now now that could do anything I could say sing me a song I could say tell me a bedtime story I could say I can make it do many many things now and I think what was cool is Fatin and this little like lab that we built and the lab has like some 3D printers some Electronics area honestly we started with like an empty room and people would come by they're like What's this room for I'm like oh it's going to be a machine shop Electronics lab one day like oh can I use it I'm like yeah we have nothing here what do you need you need tables great we'll bring tables oh you need like a little thing okay we'll add that you need 3D printers will add that and I've seen now like tens of people come through a you know one person sit there spend some time tinker and Fatin did that like he built one he showed us he built another he tried different various different versions you know built you know new cases to he printed buying raspberry pies new software and like I think he shipped like 60 to 70 units across four to six months which in software rule just feels like wow ancient like 60 users in Hardware this might have cost like half a million to a million dollars and I think we did that for like 50 to 100 Grand right so like that difference one person 3D printers raspberry pies some Ai and you could just sit there and deliver units and try it with people when we showed be first by the way internally bar was like no I don't I don't think kids are going to do this is weird his daughter used it and it changed his mind like like she changed his mind right because he saw what it could do but like how do you get that opportunity to prototype cheap right so Hardware being hard it's like maybe Hardware is not hard as it used to be that like Sam calls these inflections where you know um something changes like there's famously an inflection where uh when ObamaCare came out then Oscar Health built a thing that was just to do Obamacare and like you know had you know became like a billion dollar company it's like so what are the inflections so oh phones now have GPS um in them now you can build Uber you couldn't build Uber before because the driver and the rider needed to find each other how were they going to do that if you didn't have phones with what s on them uh phones have cameras now you can have Instagram right so it's like the technology inflection can happen it's one type of inflection and you're basically saying because of raspberry pi plus AI plus 3D printing to Consumer Hardware is very easy consumer Hardware is now possible now like now more than ever two people can actually mess around and Tinker till they get something right kind of wasn't feasible 5 10 years ago correct like when we buil Jamie I used a Raspberry Pi at that time which was the first version Raspberry Pi was thought of as it obest Market of tinkerers that are going to buy a few of them they've they've sold like 60 million units or something ridiculous like that like 35 bucks a pop 60 million there like a few billion dollars of Raspberry Pi out there and I think what it did is you used to have to make like custom boards custom software and you know for a technical person like me I don't want to go that far like I have certain skills that I could do really well and typically it's like read a few guides in the internet and like Stitch stuff together it felt too far for even like somebody like me it felt like man there like really serious engineering any need 10 people I millions of dollars I got to convince somebody there's a big market and now like build up this a company which probably would fail because I raised too much too much pressure too much Demand on return Etc and to me the Raspberry Pi was one of the unlocks and there's the Nvidia Jetson now which has like gpus on device and there's so much more there but so what are what are other things besides magical toys that you saw somebody built interesting things you're seeing built in the hardware robotics side yeah so we have uh AJ is building the you know neurosity he built that first version which I think I've showed you before which the brain computer interface now he has a second version um that's really tiny it's like the size of airpods you could put it right here special purpose so really like the ability to prototype develop the thing get like hundreds or thousands of units out there improve the design and doing that without a giant team allows them to kind of continue we've seen like a variety of things kind of come out on that front I think the second area that's happening is you know there's a consumer hardware and then there's like this robotics drones and kind of this other world where we have so much physical equipment in the world forklifts and lawnmowers and cars and like Dr you know all these things that we do um that requires either a person like you know with drones we invest in this company Lucid drones which you know they built a power washing drone could go up in buildings could power wash the you know the glass set of people hanging from the side uh there's another company that um and is that working like do people is it like yeah working very well and you know like what's interesting is there's like a unique business model to find here as well and I think this is why I love like being in the weeds a little bit and like seeing it is like most people think you're going to build this product and then you're going to take the people that like manually wash a building and you're going to like get rid of them what actually happens is there's like a team that's like a little like small business somewhere they have like five people at their company Dave's power washing Dave windows so clear you won't even know it's there amazing right Dave's got a great tagline as well and you know people end up finding that if you just sell to those those small businesses you give them more tools they could serve more buildings do it more efficiently that distribution is built in maybe in the long run this starts changing but like now there are a ton of these opportunities I've seen one for farms and like you know mowing the weeds around certain fruits or kind of like in expecting them you just send people between these things to go like do it and now there's like a little like robot and you know instead of the one person doing it for two weeks or two people the one person's there monitoring it at the facility in air conditioning and like watching on the iPad watching on the iPad and it might get stuck early on or might detect something now they got to go fix that thing this efficiency I think is like massive and we're seeing it at many places saw the same thing I saw these two guys building here in San Francisco they're like random Warehouse in the back of some other store like two dudes like literally grinding bootstrapping like like just go there I'm like I like these guys they took a forklift they automated it they took self-driving car tech it probably took billions of dollars to develop and then all of that kind of flow to like open source and typically open source sometimes is behind Than The Cutting Edge but in 10 years that like normalizes uh we see this elsewhere like AI models like llama but like really they took cameras and some liar stuff and they scrapped a little computer to a forklift and they could move it around you could talk to it you could kind of get it to do things and I think there's a massive Resurgence so forklift physical thing you took a little Raspberry Pi internet some cameras some technology like we were doing computer vision technology to score like fortnite games they're using that same kind of technology to look at oh this is a box this is the barcode that I picked up right that I can now use and figure out what's this thing it could go walk around the warehouse and be like oh that Pet's in the wrong spot how it just scanned the barcode and detected oh there's this pallet here supposed to be over there go pick it up move it over there like these problems exist in warehouses like I mean you know I think you've dealt with some of those P I've run a warehouse and so to me it's like what are the machines like what are the traditional machines we've built probably for the last 100 years that you're going to slap a little computer on it and now it's a superpower and I think this is bringing down the cost of like this robotic C like building a robotic arm used to be like yo I got to be like Tony Stark and like Iron Man I've seen two people do it in a machine shop I there's a guy here I don't even know his company I just show he just had a 3D printed hand on his desk and I'm like what the hell is this it's like oh yeah like I I I created the ability to develop a full hand with all the fingers and everything in just this 3D printer there's a bamboo left printer which honestly 3D printer was great and then bamboo Labs took it to a whole another level like a little bit of AI to help selfle in and make prints great and like everybody loves it and he just built his hand pretty high quality took a little fishing net on the inside of the hand so like in each finger he could like pull every finger and like do some stuff it's like one dude like few months hackathon and like I don't know what he's going to produce from that but I just think you could do these things now in like weeks and months when they took years and like a lot of money I think there's a huge opportunity here still going to take time to like marinate and develop but I look at it as one of those things were like if I was a mechanical engineer if I liked hardware and I've been told that it's just Ai and software and like your stuff isn't that interesting it's like no no this is very interesting right now like right you need to find a place to do it and you know like I even say like I think we're going even further for us like we have this base we built here we call the founder lab like this is where a lot of people come they Tinker on stuff we have Founders here we have Builders we have creators here we have all kinds of people doing stuff built a little machine shop and that kind of pushed us to be like wait there's more we're seeing more we're talking to more people thinking about this and so I ended up getting this kind of industrial space and call it the garage it's 20,000 square feet of industrial space I'll show you in a little bit but it looks like you know San Francisco real estate is not the best I think this is a time to make these bets but I've talked to 25 to 50 Founders in the last 12 months that need a hardware space like this to Tinker to have smart people around them to have the machines around them to just being able to develop it probably for less than 100 Grand they can go and proof of concept and prototype the thing and look we're seeing the hype cycle of like humanoid robots right that's that like hype above I'm more excited about all these startups that are going to form they're going to build this expertise they're going to be$ hundred million doll teams whether it's their product or their knowledge right that's happening now and two people are doing it like every single day like they're spawning these things and so consumer Hardware is is one area but I think Robotics and what typically was known as like deep Tech like I need like phds and like stacks of them and $50 million or $100 million that's the second one and I think it's like there's a few people seeing it maybe there are sectors like defense where it's like exciting but like I don't know I think we're going to see machines everywhere and every kind of version of it and I I think I've seen people develop like cooking robots laundry machine things folding drones to inspect stuff drones to map interior spaces like matterport is a giant company and a human goes and puts a tripod everywhere like there's a little drone that's going to fly through the whole house and like map it for you and that expands that and I just see one or two person teams able to do this faster than I've ever seen it I feel more capable maybe I just really want to get into Hardware again myself and well I think that's the point though it's a lot of people would want to mess with this and if something goes from not Tinker to Tinker B suddenly it's now the like it's kind of like before you're competing One V one now it's one versus the field the field of course any individual thing in the field might suck correct but the field overall is super powerful and now you're saying the field is open for you know Hardware tinkerers which it wasn't open before that's a big deal yeah we do these like residencies here we'll bring people here for a month or six weeks we just tell them like here's a theme here's a space to go do things when the Vision Pro came out we did it we had about 40 Vision Pro devs we probably had the largest concentration of Vision Pro devs out of apple anywhere and the knowledge of that like look it didn't produce some ridiculous outcome we actually did invest in one or two teams from that I think we just got a chance to see that technology deeply we did this AI Hardware one I remember meeting this this kid and I don't know where he was in the world and he shows me this like robot he like built like a humanoid he built like in his bedroom and it's like half he only Built the B like the legs so like stopped like where the waist was and it was like totally hand conr red and I'm like yeah this is wild but the fact that you could like bootle this in your bedroom and like it could take steps it's like crazy to me I met these other guys Premiere and the same Trend in Raspberry Pi they took that Trend and I mean I love some of these I just you know I love it cuz I jump on the video and they're they were up in Seattle or something and it's like their kitchen and I'm like is that a 3D printer in your sink and it's just like their kitchen is like all machines and I'm like dude you got to get out of your house and I got to give you a home to like do that that's what I want is like people who will just turn their bedroom into this like no no no you come do it here we'll give you a little bit better facilities will give you space you get a better place to sleep and they took this like Raspberry Pi Trend and they're like oh people will start with raspberry pies and then they build a custom board oh we're building a modular Raspberry Pi thing that computer intermediate step oh you want a speaker well you could pick whatever speaker you want just put that in oh you want to produce 2,000 units now we have the ability to scale it for you so they took the hobbyist world and the behavior that's happening driving in and they started this in their literally in their kitchen and like I just think that man that's capable now and that's the trend that I can't I can't like unsee it sometimes and in Hardware both in consumer and more deep Tech Hardware like drones platform is massive right to be able to do things so much opportunity to utilize that I don't know how long it's going to take for this to become mass and mainstream but I just keep seeing that Trend right now and I think for us that's the you're making that's the bet we make and so I always joke with the guys here it's like we want a bet on negative 1 to zero like Peter the talked about the 0 to one companies like we still one step even before that like you're at negative one you're wandering the forest you need to place a tinker and like kind of get the ideas to form this is what we this is what we wanted to do right all right love it uh F this is amazing uh good catching up as always uh let's go check out some of these spaces let's do it thanks so much [Music] f

when I was 19 I had been arrested six times I was drinking doing drugs I was 230 lb my life was going nowhere that was really when I turned my life around learning how to live my life in accordance with my goals and values rather than my feelings and that was really what taught me a lot of discipline I ended up losing almost 100 lb moved across the country from Michigan to California there must have been some wakeup call where you decided to start making a shift there was two moments I was at a party like I'm pretty overweight now I hope nobody says anything I hear a guy he's like what a shame I was like what you were really pretty but you're just really fat now in that moment I was like what he said is true the second moment was the sixth time that I was arrested see my dad sitting on the couch if you keep doing this I think you're just going to end yourself I felt so terrible that I made someone who loves me so much and only made my life better feel so by who I was being that terrified me enough to immediately change literally everything

phone boots and companies could you quickly tell this story cuz I think it's kind of inspiring it started at Plex sport we never had enough conference rooms I got this Carpenters on Craigslist to make a couple of phone boots out of just like wood they were terrible not enough ventilation so you'd come out of this thing just dripping in sweat people were in there nonstop I was like if the product's this bad and yet everybody wants to use it there's like something here my friend Henrik who's the founder of airel really ran with this idea he built it into a company so we made like these really nice Swedish design the intellectual property was we put three fans in we was doing like $50 million in sales 50 yeah we're selling thousands of them and somehow we couldn't make money just the unit economics wrong or the overhead how many people on the team spending money on PS I'm a little pissed about it you're selling $50 million you should make 10 million profit at least right I think the founder had ambition to be like billion dollar unicorn company instead of like let's sell this thing to Staples for $50 million and like be happy somebody should reboot this idea do it without the mismanagement

all right Sam in the next hour I am going to flood you with business ideas I am going to create an absolute lunchroom food fight slinging business ideas at you you are going to be drenched and covered with ideas are you prepared for [Music] this great analogy the lunchroom one did you just that up yeah that was very good by the way all of these ideas very half-baked came to me you know I would say 75% of them I thought of this morning because we had a guest cancel and we said let's record anyways and how about we do some business ideas let's give the people what they want it the season of giving and we're going to give the people what they want which is fun business ideas well the first one you actually have a lot of intel on right you actually use this the first one I have some bets I have some bets on horses and those horses are are currently paying out and I haven't been talking too much about it but I think it's time so Tik Tok let's talk about Tik Tok Tik Tok right now if you open up your phone do you have Tik Tok on your phone no okay for some of you you might have trouble opening the app because there might just be millions of dollars jammed in the app and it's a little bit like stuck so it might be hard to open up because there is so much money available in Tik Tok right now like do you use Tik Tok as a user of course I'm a Tik Tok addict oh that's why I don't use it I I had it and I deleted it I I love Tik Tok I have a lot of fun on it um but I also have a couple of business bets that are doing really well in this space and I think right now people are sleeping on it when you say business bets do you mean things that you own or Investments of other people I own equity in companies that are doing this that's what I'm asking okay so you invested in companies that are doing this not something you fully own and not operating correct I'm trying not to operate anything at this point yeah cuz that like Insight is a little bit different yeah yeah but these are all like uh there is something in between so there's like Angel Investing which is you write the check sort of passive uh you're on the outside I would say you're on the other side of the fence they lob you updates over the fence and then there's things where you own you know 10 20 30 40% of the company and you're active you're more actively in in the loop you're not active dayto day with your hands but you're active with your ears and your mouth all right so anyways right now on Tik Tok um Tik Tok today is a little bit like Facebook was maybe 2012 to 2014 and if you remember you at that time were working out a place called Founders dojo and um there was a guy who used to work there named Mo Ali and mo Ali today is more famous because he started a brand called native deodorant um you want to give the like two seconds of what it was like being at the founder Dojo when he was creating native basically it was this guy who went to Harvard Harvard Law I think and so he was like clearly smart and he had a small Ecom startup that he sold for like $4 million or something like that so very promising but still like you know he he was young and he's like what am I going to do in the founders Dojo which was like my little uh 10 person office that I shared with some other guys he was looking for something to sell he thought mattresses he thought a few other things eventually he landed on deodorant and right in front of us literally every day he learned how to use Facebook ads in in a very short amount of time scaled his deodorant business from zero to just an idea to something like 30 or 40 million in Revenue in literally 18 months eventually sold it for $100 million in cash in like 24 months all right in front of us yeah 2 and a half years end to end uh from time of start to time of exit $100 million sold to practor gamble okay so why did he do that one he picked a interesting category but he was doing something that not every not a lot of other Harvard graduate smart people were doing and at that time on Facebook you could get traffic for very cheap you could get sales for very cheap and he was able to build up a consumer base at the right place at the right time basically by the way I saw his sheet uh we wrote an article on it and he like sent it to me I think he was spending $4 and the each customer who we spent $4 to acquire was then spending $16 with him I believe that was the numbers so it was like a moneymaking machine okay yeah I'm not sure the math but it was something like that it was sort of like you know four to1 5 to1 six to1 payout on on every dollar okay so which is very hard to achieve today today uh you know 1.5 is the new four to one right so basically you put in a dollar you get a150 oh that that same machine used to give you $4 for every dollar man those are the good old days well the good old days are right now on Tik talk and so what's actually happening so here here's the breakdown of how this actually works so you create a product of whatever type could be digital could be physical great product now I want you to look at something go down on our sheet there is uh on page four there's an infographic and it's from a brand called goalie you know what goalie is it's apple cider vinegar gummies so they just sell gummies like gummy vitamins but specifically ACV apple cider vinegar which was kind of like a health Wellness Trend and craze now goalie dude first of all you could put anything in a gummy I guess like in a like it started with weed understood then like I do creatine that way now you could do the the last thing that I thought you could possibly do in a gummy which is vinegar yeah yeah and actually if you drink apple cider vinegar tastes horrible the goalie gummies taste great it's like you know it's apple cider vinegar without the pain okay so goalie itself was a business that grew like crazy from zero to hundreds of millions in Revenue I think they ran into financial trouble they they had to sell bankruptcy something like that they were like they got way ahead of their skis the group that bought it has basically restarted it and one of the main things that they're doing is this Tik Tok Creator method that I'm talking about so look at this infographic this is a Rewards program for Tik Tok creators so if you're a Tik Tok Creator not only do you get a little Kickback on what you sell but if every month you hit a certain sales Target you can get something so low tier you know, 1500 gmv you can get an iPad all right cool 4,000 gmv meaning you sell $4,000 worth of product you you get an iPhone all right let's keep going up 15,000 in gmv you get an all-inclusive trip to Aruba 50,000 you get a Rolex two and more you get the Aruba trip the iPad and you get the Rolex right they're stacking now let's go to the high tiers there are people that have done a million dollars they get a condo in Miami if you do a million dollars I think this is in a month um of your your gmv Target and so they're going to creators they say hey do you want this condo in Miami it could be yours so creator is one way that you can make money on Tik Tok so you don't even have to do the brand or service you could just say I am going to sit here and figure out how the [ __ ] to sell apple cider vinegar gummies and if I do if you get a if you get a million they give you a Lamborghini yeah oh my God and and there's people who have achieved these targets okay so this is their program right now so this is who you're competing against if you're going and trying to recruit these creators it's like you're a division one college basketball program and you're trying to go get McDonald's all-americans to come play at your your program like there are guys it's like oh man there's this kid in Witchita this guy's just a creative genius he's he just sits in his bedroom and he just figures out the best hooks the best angles and brands are putting them on retainer 10 20 $30,000 a month in order to get this guy to create for them this is what's happening right now in the Creator space how many views do the big videos have millions tens of millions of views they can get they can get like a million likes on a video so you get a million likes you might have had five million views or six million views this is crazy that like there's a guy dressed up in Scrubs talking about it I have no idea if he's actually works in the medical industry but because he's wearing scrubs I'm like all right what do you what do you got to say all right my friends so a lot of you guys who listen to the show you listen because you want to start a company but you're not sure what idea to choose or you may not even have an idea and you like our podcast my first million because we've done a lot of the work for you on researching all these business ideas well my friends we've made life a lot easier for you because HubSpot they just put together together an entire list of all the resources that you can use to find a market opportunity to validate for your next business idea so if you're looking for a market size calculator or tools to identify market trends or a huge list of ideas to get started so if you're interested there's a link below click it and you can have access to the whole thing it's completely free now back to the show okay so goalie did this gurunanda teeth whitening are you familiar with this I think the teeth whitening area is full of scammers and I think that you are not a scammer for using Tik Tock shop but I think a lot of these scammers use this [ __ ] this like Tik Tok thing like this way and so it doesn't surprise me that a teeth whitening company would be using it I'm not by the way I'm not saying these guys are scammers at all but you know what I mean yeah but but I'm also not saying they're not no no no no no no I have no idea about this brand but I know I've seen a lot of like [ __ ] teeth whitening companies and I like look into the research and I'm like oh this ises nothing yeah I I don't know the effectiveness of any of these things all I know is that these uh they're selling a lot of product I think the guru nand teeth whitening is the number one selling product on all of Tik Tok and Tik Tok is the number like kind of the most used app in the country basically right so you have this like top selling product on the top selling network uh it's pretty insane and so if they're the top on Tik Tok how much revenue do you think they do I have tried to back into this I don't I don't know the exact I don't want to say a number that's going to be way off on this podcast would it be crazy to say like 5 million bucks a month I don't think that would be crazy no okay let me put it that way the brands that are doing this strategy well are doing really well and you and and by the way this creates a halo effect right so you you sell the products directly off that one video but then people hear about it and then when they see their ad the ad performs better because I've heard about this product before oh yeah I've seen 10 10 videos about this product so now when you put the paid ad in front of me those 10 organic Impressions paid off or I go search for it on Amazon Amazon then takes that signal and says wow people really are searching for this name maybe we should surface it higher or Google says may we should surface this higher people are searching for this keyword brand so with that product category so in that product category give it more rank so there's this multiple multiplier effect of this I have to imagine this is fairly mainstream though because marketers are like piranhas like when there's like flesh in the water like they all like one person tells one person and they all flock to it and they eventually ruin it so how much life does this still have and how mainstream is this amongst brands um let's say it's in the Red Zone still so basically it's not as good as when I first discovered it and I didn't want to talk about it on the Pod because it's too good right like when something's just like absolute Gang Busters right and it's unfair Advantage you feel like you know a secret nobody else knows it's not there however more importantly it's still at a spot where you can go do this today it would still work if you just go and do this today so still works but you're not the only one doing it right both both are true I have you and like 10 other friends in the Ecom world and every business they complain about a variety of things with software it's churn whatever uh with Ecom the complaint oftentimes is cash flow and inventory you're saying huge numbers let's say hypothetically 5 million a month $60 million a year but is that actually a good business when you're doing this or is this one of those things that if you get big you still are broke look if you're bad at business you'll find a way to lose money in any business even the goalie example I gave you right hundreds of millions of dollars and basically went bankrupt along the way so so there are ways to lose to to snatch defeat from the jaws of Victory um there are also people that are absolutely printing profitably with this and so I've seen both I've seen both examples I don't think it's about the model I think it's about how well you actually run your business and how much common sense you use one of the great things about this from a cash flow perspective is normal Ecom business you put up the money for the ad you put up the capital at risk in order to get users with this you only put up free product at risk so you send inventory to the Affiliates the Affiliates create create the content you pay nothing for that ad until the sale is generated dude so if you're a digital product you crush it here exactly so I have a couple of examples of of digital products as well in my list so okay here we go that's a long setup for five ideas that I think you could take onto Tik Tok and crush with right now number one so I want you to watch this video it's uh go scroll down and look at this link that says Botox so the video starts says face taping is my jam and then the other podcast goes tell me about this and she goes if you had told me 14 months ago that I would not be doing Botox and I would be taping my face instead I would have said you're effing out of your mind so what a hook right so this girl basically saying I used to Bo use Botox and now I use this and I would have thought this is crazy and then the other girl's like tell me more so this video itself has a quarter million likes uh I don't know how many views this thing has by the way they have it so usually it's like Bros it's dudes like discussing stuff in a podcast setting that that becomes like the meme this is like two pretty women is this even a real podcast or they this one is a lot of people fake these but this is the the wellness process podcast so that video has five 5.4 million views okay so and they're not selling a product to be clear a lot I mean look at the comments every single comment is what's the brand anyone know the brand cuz she says there's this Japanese face tape and anytime you say Japanese face tape versus just face tape already elevated and everybody's asking for the brand nobody knows what the heck's going on some people are criticizing it's a polarizing thing it's a visual thing these are good things when you want to sell on Tik Tok so idea one is Botox face tape I think you can make $50 million in Topline Revenue I'll say 15% margins so you know whatever that comes out to in the next 18 months okay let's be more conservative 24 months if you hit this well so you can make you know7 half million dollar profit you could build a brand because there's a lot if you look at the market there's a lot of people that are um on Tik Tok that obviously care what they look like AKA everybody there's a lot of people who are Botox curious but never going to pull the trigger because it's either too expensive like individual Botox treatments are like thousands of dollars or they just feel like it's too extreme and they're Crossing that threshold into plastic surgery and they don't want to do it for that reason maybe some maybe they'll be judged maybe self resect maybe they have to go somewhere it's uncomfortable it's like hims right there a bunch of barriers reasons why you wouldn't do it dude I looked up if this works on chat gbt the answer is no who knows right health and wellness is like one of these things right like do those little do those little like fa uh Jade face rollers work you know do just putting cucumber slices on your eyes and and doing a like uh Ari came on here the other day I was like Ari you're glowing she's like I did a chemical peel and I was like I don't know what that is tell me more there's a whole world of beauty treatments that like have some on the spectrum of Effectiveness and cost they you know they land somewhere all I'm saying is that I think this could work I don't know if red light therapy is going to change your skin and your hair but you know it's it's selling is kind of my point right now I'm not a doctor I can't make Health claims I have a friend who is uh went is a doctor and anyway she does Botox for people and she was at my house and she had her kit with her and she was like I need to like test this out and we were like did you get BOTOX curious I was like looking at her I was like whip that whip that sucker out baby let's do this and so she gave me a little injection like 6 weeks ago where I got in my forehead uh like like I was like you know I like I don't even know if I want to do this but like I'm a guinea pig you know you got a needle you got drugs like I'm going to try I would love to hear this excuse you're about to make right out you're like I like science and I just thought you know I wanted to be a supportive friend of hers and I wanted more small businesses what are your other reasons that you did Botox tell me let's make a list of Sam's reasons did besides I wanted to look better go ahead looking dope naked I mean there's like that's the only reason why anyone does anything uh right uh uh but it was I got so many compliments afterwards did you really yes I got so many compliments and it was freead they someone says you look really young people kept saying I looked young and I was like and it made me self-conscious on how I used to look like and oh dude you're hooked have you ever you would never do that you're not into that right no dude come on would you what would you say if your wife wanted to do it I think my wife does want to do it but she's in that that boat where she's like I I don't really want to do it but I want to do I'm curious like it's the same I bet you if somebody was at the house and had the kid and was like yeah I can do it right now I think she would be like you and I I think her forehead would start looking smooth or whatever it does yeah like she was right here I was like yeah I mean if the needle's right there like stick it in me like let's let's do the damn thing so ites driving to Taco Bell right now but door Dash if it brings it to me I wouldn't not eat it if it's there so uh yeah I guess you could say I'm Botox curious I think Beyond curious activated all right what's the next one all right next one uh another one the beauty space and there a theme Here Beauty things are tap into a core human desire they are visual by Nature they can have before and afters and they obviously are you know high margin great businesses when you can build them and so I want to take anything that worked in the D Toc in the in the prior waves of e-commerce and I want to see if I can build a Tik Tock native distribution strategy around it that's a lot of fancy words to say if it worked with Facebook ads I'm going to see if it worked with Tik Tok videos okay so one of the big Winners I think she spoke at your conference was a br called Madison Reed dude there's a location right down the street from my house I think they do really well yeah so Madison Reed has built a real Empire around hair color and I don't know the full story but basically you know hair color is not a new idea they ex you know there were many brands that existed my mom has been buying this ever since I was a little kid you know she would go to Target and buy you know dark Browns cuz she didn't want gray hair or she in my sister if she wanted to try it damn you're going to do your mom like that oh D dude if I'm grayed up you don't think my mom's grayed up like obviously obviously and so you know my sister would if she wanted to try having lighter hair for a season whatever go buy hair color so Madison Reed basically built a you know kind of online first distribution strategy so a bunch of Facebook ads and built a huge brand in the space I think Madison re I don't know what they're worth but I would not be surprised I just looked it up Topline Revenue grew 20% last year to uh $150 million in Revenue yeah so the valuation something like 500 million plus so huge success um I think you could do a new Madison Reed on Tik Tok I think that's just a bet worth taking which is same idea maybe you have some new novel angle maybe it's that it's easier to apply maybe it's that it's less messy in your cleanup maybe it's uh less harsh chemical so it doesn't damage your hair the same amount whatever come up with your your reason why this is new and build the brand off of Tik Tok and I think you could do this again with creators who are going to use the product show the customers build trust build your brand get people searching for your brand because there's not there's always going to be a new wave of people who are interested in this right so there's either people who are whose hair is starting to gray um there's always going to be a new generation and so whatever the old whatever whatever media they consume is where you need to be in order to sell that right like remember like Touch of Gray or whatever like men's whatever the men's hair color one you know they did it on TV ads and the Madison re did was Facebook ads whatever the next generation is they're probably going to get sold to over Tik Tok and Instagram reals and you know what's funny is uh you said there's a new generation that wants this stuff but you know what has not changed and will always be the same is the hooks that worked in 1910 will still work today so for example there's this Wall Street Journal ad that tells the story of two young men one young man when they both when they both graduated college one young man got a Wall Street Journal subscription and because of that he got a better career whatever and it tells a story there are so many ads that replicate that story or that idea successfully because if you Google like best Wall Street Journal ad of all time they csite that ad and so what I like to do um is find old ads from as late as the 30s the 40s like it could be like uh print magazine ads and just see like what's like an interesting line yeah what's like the human nature Vibe of this and just rip it so like for example there's this one very famous ad where it says they laughed at me S when I sat down but then when I started to play the piano dot dot dot and that's called The Curiosity gap which is do you remember the brand you know uh BuzzFeed and then what was the other one called Upworthy it was like uh you know 10 reasons why blank you're not going to believe number seven that's the same hook as that piano ad and so it's really fun to find old ads and just be like what's the human nature element of this and just replicate it on Tik Tok exactly exactly great way to find hooks okay here's a here's a different uh different category so I did Beauty let me give you a different one self-help so one of the top selling products in the last year is something called The Shadow work Journal have you heard of this no but uh that's a great name Shadow work Journal so you get a if if you go look on Amazon or t oh I've seen this I have seen this the Amazon listing for this currently has over 5,000 ratings and this is like a self-published type of book and this journal on Tik Tok has sold over 100,000 copies you know you know how rare it is for a book to sell 100,000 copies in like the first year that had ever existed with no other promotion um so this was a was a huge success and basically it was like um people on Tik Tok would they'd have the book open they'd be like like the gasp I gasped when I read this line and you're like all right what's the line and then they'll read you this like kind of heavy emo-ish quote from this journal and then it's like or they be like you know um I finally figured out my this like my my true Shadow you're like what and it's like you know it kind of gets into like this whole like you know like the gypsy girl type of vibe it's like there's a whole like group of people that love therapy that love like horoscopes there's like these like weird vend diagrams that you can find where it's like people who are really into sort of the Mystic self and so this book capitalized on that I think today if you were to write I don't know why I said you I should have said me if I were to write a modern-day version of you know Tony robbins's book un least of power within or Mark Manson's book The subtle art of not giving a [ __ ] I think if I wrote a modern version of those and I just pumped let's say nine months and a quar million dollars of effort into seeding it on Tik Tok I think I could have a by far a best seller I think I could sell you know millions of copies of a book this isn't a book right is this like one of those things where it's a journal it's like two word or two pages three pages of of of writing and then a week's worth of like no no no this is not like a planner it's not like a daily planner it's I mean I haven't read the whole thing but like it's basically it's a lot of text content but then there are like Fillin the blanks or like what's that for you in a box and you write in your box but it's not like it's not like just it's not just days and you you you need a journal in it yourself have you seen design your life is that what it's called yeah designing your life it's like a book by like you know it hits all the check marks where it's like a Harvard psychologist who spent 30 years studying happiness and lifestyle design Stanford I think yeah yeah like writes a book on this and then it's a it's a cool book I read it and then now they have like a journal that goes along with it and you could just look at this and be like what works and what doesn't work uh but yeah and by the way the I don't know if this angle would work with you because did you have you Googled the author of that shadow yeah yeah she's very aspirational she's different than me very aspirational little that's not nobody knew nobody can see that when they're when they're buying the when they're just watching a Tik Tok because it it wasn't like it didn't look like a commercial for the book it was just somebody saying how this line in this book book really spoke to them or how this book changed the way they view things like there's a whole um hook on Tik Tok that's very famous where they say some it starts with somebody saying um do you have any book recommendations and then they Zoom the camera in really close to their nose and their eyes they go I have books that will change the way you even like look at the world I would I have books that will be so good you will never be able to look at a man again and they're like romance books or whatever like I have books that will melt the frontal lobe of your brain and they go like really intense with it and that's a that's like a common like memed hook that they use so the first it's like the first video by the way I like how you were like I don't know if you could do this this girl's hot was the thing you basically just tried to tell me well she's a 25-year-old like I'm looking at this New York Times article by the way she's 25 which is just amazing she's like a 25-year-old like really pretty woman and that's like Tik tok's demographic like you know you're like you're a in Tik Tok world the videos are not her uh the videos are whatever uh the videos are from the Creator the Creator just looks how the Creator looks they they don't look like her and this is amazing by the way you know I think at one one point you were like I feel like I'm riding a horse like a few years after Henry Ford invented the car uh like it's just like it's you can't compete when I see these videos and these plans I think to myself I can never compete in this world of Ecom this is just insane like the way that they St like the way that you were describing Zoom in on someone's eyes if I were in that meeting and trying to figure out how to do it or in my bedroom like at night trying to like figure out like how do I write this script I would have been like this is like this is like cringe like I can't do this do you know what I mean never be able to push post yeah like I I can't you know what I mean it's really hard I totally get what you mean and I'm by the way I'm not saying that these are easy to do I don't I don't mean to say that I just mean that somebody's going to do these and I think the way to think about this is what are your attributes so for you and me at this point if we want to do something that's going to be you know successful we have other attributes like well I could just use capital I have a lot of capital I could just invest in things that are already working that's an easy way to make money um I have a good Network I have a unique Network where I know a lot of people who are doing interesting things and they will uniquely let me into something okay that's cool maybe I have this audience from the podcast so I have attributes if your attributes are I got a [ __ ] ton of time I have nothing to lose and I have pretty Shameless with my phone right 24 and I grew up like mastering this stuff yeah I just been effing around on Tik Tok or I understand the meta game here better than whoever is the brand marketing manager or the head of paid acquisition for Madison Reed or whatever these things are then you're the one right Moyes it's like I get that I can go to Facebook ads and Tinker on this all day in a way that Proctor and gambles head of head of marketing is not going to do they're going to be buying Super Bowl ads they're not going to be sitting here in Facebook ad manager every day and doing that but but you know you get what I mean right like you have different advantages than the incumbents do and I think if your advantage is that you grew up on these networks or you you're willing to hustle with with in a way that they're not you're willing to sit there and slide into DMS and send out free product and do all this stuff you can win and you can win in in in these categories that already exist when I was with Moyes during that I mean when I say with him like he was just we know we weren't like we were just acquaintances but I would just see him on his computer and he' like everyone check this out and like she he would track the numbers every single day in this spreadsheet and be like we just changed this number from a 1% to a 1.25% and then it was like now that 1.25 that's the standard for that day now we're going to add in this one new change we're going to add a yellow or a red arrow pointing at this one thing boom we just got that 1.25 to 1.4 tomorrow we're going to do that like it was like a methodical like it was basically like I would joke I just call I was like dude we're all just spreadsheet monkeys cuz like all tring to do is he was just doing was just staring at the spreadsheet turning 1.4 to like 1.6 you know what I mean right well I think by the way he's not he wasn't just like that kind of at the beginning and now he's like oh he's made it so he's different no he's he's still the same way dude I had a question for him about our econ Biz I was like hey here's how we're keeping track of this we're trying to use this I don't know if I should trust this or if I should trust Google analytics or if I should trust [ __ ] whale or I should trust Shopify analytics they're all give me slightly different numbers like how do you how did you you do it and I just figured I just figured he'd be like you know I just you I just kept it simple I just did this and he goes he did say I just kept it simple and I was like oh okay cool so which one did you just you just picked one and he goes no I just kept it simple every day I went in and I wrote down the numbers for all the platforms every single day here's my sheet and he was still doing it now this is like 10 years later the guy's animal yeah $100 million later and he wakes up in the morning and he sits down he triangulates and he tracks he goes yeah they never drift between you know more than 4% but I just do it anyway so I'm just like it's kind of like um almost like a daily practice almost like a like a almost like a religious act he would do every day a spiritual act he would do sort of an offering to the economic Gods if you're a chef at a bakery and you've worked there for 20 years you know that if you leave the dough out for an hour versus 45 minutes before you put it in the oven you're going to have a very minor difference because you've done that thousands of times and that's basically like the same thing you know what I mean like you notice these very small differences uh I admire his um tenacity uh towards things I don't think he does anything in a not tenacious way uh all right let me continue I got two more ideas for you okay so I did beauty stuff I did a book or self-help and by the way that's how Mark Manson made subtle art of not giving a f like tens of millions of copies sold he was blogging before that and built a Blog audience and he used the blog audience to launch the book and that was dude a Blog audience seems like so old school uh like when I'm hearing this because a Blog takes 10 years and hundreds of thousands of words and potentially hundreds or thousands of posts dude I've told this story before but I'm going tell it again because there's a lot of new listeners there was a time when I was building an at about you know five to 10 years ago where I was building an app that we thought would be a big hit in high schools oh dude teens teens will love this app so I said well what are we doing we're all just 20 to 30y old guys sitting in this office we got to let's let's go show this to some teens so we went first we stood outside of a a Chipotle we said free burrito if you test our app they looked at us like we were creeps but they took our free burritos tested the app said all right we we need to get more people saying yes right now only one out of 10 is willing to take a risk I said how do we just go to where they're a captive audience they're trapped so we went to a school we said hey I'd love to come in and teach a class on business and it and at the end I'm going to tell him about our new app is that okay so they said yeah sure we came in we basically got to be a substitute teacher and I remember going up in front of the class I think this is like a n9th or 10th grade class and I was like uh we're telling them about their app and they're like all right like we'll try it like just give us the app I was like cool so um you just got to get the test flight and we put a uh link on the uh said can we just pull up the link and then you guys just go to this go to this URL uh just go to this link and then you'll get the app and there's was it was it like sean.com J l498 whatever I was just like just write it down it's just a just do this link and the guy in the back just looks up and his phone was all like cracked and whatever he just looked at me he just goes links are gay and I can tell you there was no recovering from that and he said that the whole class just stopped typing they're like yeah he's right links are gay links are gay that's what's like today blog it's like if I said hey I'm starting a blog because I really want to use this as kind of like building my audience to promote my book I'm going to do they'd be like blogs are gay is what like that ninth grader would have shouted at me just like absolutely humiliating me dude but what's old is New Again it'll come back eventually hopefully hopefully uh all right so two last ideas candy candles click this link and uh if you're on YouTube You'll see this on on our video screen it's important to look at these because these are you're selling a visual product so go down and see where I put candles just watch that video right there oh my God it's all right a mason jar holy crap wait those are not are those real Oreos so it's a mason jar with a lady dipping what looks like Oreos and animal crackers is as if she's making like a Oreo smoothie with whipped cream in a mason jar exactly but the but instead of the Smoothie it's wax that's wax I thought that was realing cuz this is a candle no this is a candle these that's wax I don't know if the Oreos are real or not I can't tell but that's what I'm saying I can't of course it's not real look at the numbers on this video all right it has 600,000 likes holy [ __ ] how many views does this have I don't know this so this woman had as and she's just like a lady she's like a baker she just made that video so I saw that video and I was like oh man um this could be a product why do I believe this so one just like I said I wanted to take things that worked in the Facebook ads Heyday and be like could I translate this into with the new distribution engine another version of that is take anything that sells well in an MLM because Tik Tok kind of works the same way Tik Tok is basically you you give your product to a bunch of people they go and then shill it to their Network and their Community that's how an MLM kind of works without the the pyramid part of the the scheme but this lady's work is so good like I'm clicking there St it's like it's like Frappuccinos and [ __ ] like coffee that looks like it makes me I want to eat it I want to drink it but it's a candle I want to eat it drink it smell it I want all of it right and that's what I'm doing it's a basically a sensory overload and that's if I see that I think this will perform this will perform if we if we armed creators this if we had in a volume this content will always perform it has this oddly satisfying sort of delicious thing and people who like candles Love candles there's actually I said that wrong there's nobody in between you either don't use candles or You Love candles there's nobody who just kind of likes candles uh that's a candle purchaser and so that's why if you go look up successful mlms and I did this one night and I should have done an MFM episode on it but like you can go break down successful mlms and you could try to figure out what product categories are they in because those are categories that you could go into and be successful with if you just took out the MLM same product has the same desire but use a new oils yeah there's a bunch of them and so like candles is a huge one so I think I think candy candles could be a category that somebody goes into and I'll give you one last one um 23 and me so 23 and me was this like really interesting company it got really big but the company is blown up it is like self- imploded it still does $300 million a year of Revenue but theyve basically the board all resigned they quit the company's losing money the stock is in the tank it's like worth nothing now dude they had a major hack too I remember they lost six million people's DNA dud my dumbass I did it when they first launched and like it's been on there forever and I get an email saying your shit's like hacked like someone else has email yeah yeah it was horrible like it was like the wor that's probably has to be the second worst hack behind besides your bank account yeah it's terrible but I think and there's others in this space ancestry has an ancestry DNA product I think you could sell that through this network so I think a new way of acquiring customers I think that type of product which is a kind of a mix of a digital and a physical product a subscription product have you seen the food ones where no as allergy or what is it yeah so you can so the science behind this stuff is iffy it's not you know a lot of people debate if it's legit but that never that never sensitivity is what you yeah where it's like yeah where it's like which foods are you sensitive to based off DNA and bed off your saliva like it might be [ __ ] I actually think it is but a ton of people do myself included I think it's [ __ ] that's why I do it that's twoyear annual subscription yeah yeah so I think there's a huge opportunity this is five ideas I thought of this morning but I do think that uh the the upside of it is I think that unlike the cliche you know people the cliche is that you can't get rich quick you know blah blah blah there are ways that you could get rich quick you know Moy selling native for in two and a half years for $100 million that's pretty quick it's the best way to get rich is quick as Mo says and so I think that it is not and I and by the way I've seen this firsthand in a couple of the companies that we've started or or incubated that have been in this space I guess what I'm saying is the growth here is quicker than I've seen pretty much anywhere else um I don't think it's easy to do I think it's I think you're competing in like you said sort of Sharky Waters it's not that a lot of people are competing but all the people who competing here are very smart and very H very Scrappy but there's a lot of categories out there and if you can find a category where the traditional incumbents aren't doing this I think there's a lot of money to be made dude listen to this story really quick so do you remember there was this company called Elite Daily do you remember Elite Daily was like a Blog right yeah so Elite Daily was a Blog launched maybe in 2012 and within one year they scaled Elite Daily it was basically a Blog that said like um a a lot of stuff they said was like controversial so it was like you know why men should do this or women should do that you know and which a controversial take and then sometimes it was like just a variety of lists but the the guy who started it his father was Jacob the Jeweler you remember Jacob the Jeweler the rapper the guy who like yeah that was his supplied the rappers right yeah supplied the rapper that was his kid and so he started this blog when he was 22 and this was when Millennials were the genz years so Millennials with the young guys and within one year it got to be the most popular blog on the internet when sh was getting something like a 100 million monthly uniques they did it in one year about 18 months in or something like that I went to their office in New York City and their office was a bunch of like New York kids like 22y olds who are being paid like $15 or $18 an hour or something like that and they had just rows and rows of cheap Ikea tables and everyone just sitting there on their computer just like banging out headlines to articles and then they would like write just a couple words they would see which ones like they would post it on Elite Daily cuz they had so much traffic they would see which ones get a little bit of traffic and then they would go and write out the Articles and then eventually the company sold for $60 million which in the media world it was like the biggest thing on earth and so Elite Daily if you Google like Elite Daily acquired it was like the it was just like massive how fast was that how many how many years H this was like 10 years ago so I don't remember but I think it was something like two years like it was like really fast like they were doing like tens of millions in Revenue uh literally within 12 months like it was almost overnight and I remember going to their office and I thought that this was like a legit publication it was just like these like they built like some software that like could guess what was going to go viral and it they were just banging them out in this room and it was crazy because it was crazy it was an example of people who find one little hack and they go all in on it they dedicate their lives to it and they end up building a business that is huge like this is kind of what this Tik Tok thing which is like oh you're telling me if I just like get this one mom to share this thing oh I'm going to build a whole infrastructure all around this where a lot of outsiders look at this like that's crazy like what are you doing that's like ridiculous like you can't do that and they're like but why can't I like the math says that this one worked therefore I'm going to go get 300 of them and uh this Elite Daily thing it was insane to see this firsthand and I got to talk to those guys it was all wild uh this is like the new version of that and so I got to see these guys sort of like I I wasn't uh particularly friends with the founders I was friends with some of these employees so I got to see from that angle they got rich overnight basically and it was like the exact same thing of just like finding a little tiny thing and going all in on it yeah I think uh it's not it's not for everybody and it's not easy and all that my disclaimers would be why why am why am I not doing this well besides the fact that I don't really want to be you know running businesses anymore but but even if I even if I could even if I wanted to here's why I wouldn't do this it's a really frenetic and stressful space to be in that's changing like every day and so I don't like to I don't know what the right analogy would be but it's sort of like sprinting on quicksand and um I just I wouldn't really want to do it right but but if I had no other choice or if I was wired that way where that's fun for me I okay great uh I'm not really wired that way it's also age age age Makes You Different yeah the second thing is that most businesses like the terminal value you know the exit value is in how durable how sustainable how sticky is this and by definition this is not super sticky super able super sustainable um you get the upside which is a fast Spike that's sort of more than you could otherwise get organically but the downside is 18 months from now I don't know if any of this will work you might fall off a cliff uh and so I think that's the the upside and the downside of this and then also for a lot of these it's physical products it's e-commerce which is just its own beast in and of itself you have Supply chains you have fulfillment you have inventory risk and you have um shitty margins generally and so like I think dig products and software even if it doesn't grow as fast can still be a better bet to make if you're able to go there so and getting big fast is not necessarily bad as long as you have the right mindset so for example a lot of people don't talk about this but Jeff Bezos um Amazon they got huge very fast they were also Google's biggest Advertiser when Google first released advertising uh and they got big on the back of Google and it worked because they were like we're going to use this to make ourselves huge and also we know that the customer is always first so we have to provide the best customer service with the best product so if you combine all those things you can create something amazing yeah exactly I I do think also um one last uh I guess like important caveat on this is if you do this there's sort of a um better and worst ways to worst way to do it and I would say the most important variable in something like this is just the repeat purchase so how much how much of a true brand and um long-term customer can you build there's a lot of people that I see doing this for products that you would only ever buy once it's like man you're going to go through all the mental gymnastics to get somebody to buy one time and then the product is not a consumable it's not something you're meant to buy again and you're going to have to release a new product to in order another a second product or a third product of a whole different type in order to get there that's playing the hard game on extra hard mode don't I wouldn't recommend doing I think that reason is if I remember correctly I'm just remembering this from like years ago I think that's why Moyes said he didn't do mattresses I think he was like looking at mattresses and this was right when Casper became a thing but he was like yeah like a mattress is $400 and literally everyone in America needs it which is great but you only buy one every eight years right so like of the products I mentioned the botox thing the it's that's a constant once you get on that treadmill of you know sort of like face Improvement it's hard to get off tell me about it yeah I know I know you're feeling burn right now come a little closer to the camera let's take a look at that puppy um hair color you got to keep doing it candles you burn them they melt you got to get another one right so like these are things that are consumables that uh that that have repeat purchase in them do we want to end there and save your last one for another one yeah I had a bunch of other ideas not in the Tik Tok game but I think we got excited and used the whole episode for Tik Tok so if you like this we probably have two more episodes worth of just pure ideas go on YouTube or tweet at us and just comment on uh if you're going to comment on YouTube just be like you know more ideas and tell us your favorite idea of these all right thank you that's it that's the pod [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right Sean there's a documentary that r and i Ari and I were texting about did you see it it was called Martha it was on Netflix it was about Martha Stewart I haven't seen it but I actually don't know really anything about her great this is so great because Martha Stewart was a [Music] beast I I really couldn't tell you five things about Martha Stewart so like was she kind of the first influencer like in a celebrity influencer who then started launching products or what's the story Martha Stew was a killer she was a total shark she was way sharier if you only know her as her put together image of like this like housewife who cooks everything I'm going to say is going to blow your mind because she was a total shark so I'm going to give you a little bit of her background so basically she's uh born and raised up in the east coast she goes to Columbia University while she's going to school she becomes a model because she was a cute woman when she was young yeah yeah wow she was um fantastic great very pretty woman yeah go Martha she gets married at at a young age like 19 or 20 years old but graduates Colombia and her father-in-law helps her get a job as a stock broker and by the way she studied architectural like history or something like that at Columbia nothing to do with stocks and so at the age of like 24 25 she gets this job and you're probably wondering how on Earth did Martha Stewart become a stock broker well I am wondering when her father-in-law first met her he was like you have this like it Factor like you are so Charming you are so put together because she had this Vibe at a very young age in her 20s like she dressed it fantastically she was very charismatic she was clearly driven and hardworking and this small like 10 person operation that was a stock broking comp brokage they needed a saleswoman A salesperson and it was all men at the time I think this was in the 60s it was all dudes it was a very male dominated industry but she comes into this interview and eventually works there and they comment on how her she's dressed like perfectly like so perfectly that you're sort of intimidated when you first meet her because she's like perfectly put together but then she's like really charming and warm and you're like oh I I I like you and so she starts like as a salesperson basically at the stock company basically working at with with with clients and and getting them to like trust them and things like that and she kills it and so to this at the age of 26 according to this documentary she said she was making $135,000 a year which equivalent today is a million dollars a year at the age of 26 as a stock broker pretty crazy that she went from being a model to a stock broker in that short amount of time and she kills it and she does it for like six or seven years like it's like a legitimate career for her and she suggests that one of her clients buy this stock that was like a dollar and it went to like 10 bucks so it killed it then they bought a little bit more and it goes something huge like to 50 it was like this massive stock and it made these clients all this money but then the $50 stock goes right back down to like eight or 10 bucks and so technically her client had still made a bunch of money but that roller coaster ride of like making a little bit of money then making a ton of money then losing a ton of money it like left her kind of distraught and so she bailed because of that like journey and so she quit and so in the when she's like 30 years old or late 20s she moves out to actually where I'm living now Westport Connecticut she's like you know I want to have a kid I want to like tried this housewife life whatever and do this thing and she moves out here and she sits around for a very short amount of time and she's like all right I got to do something like I can't just sit here and so they buy this like kind of shitty house and she like totally turns around and red do the whole thing all by herself she paints it she builds this beautiful garden she learns how to raise Co goats and chickens and like plant her own garden and like creates this amazing like estate out in Westport Connecticut which now it's fancy back then it wasn't particularly fancy and so eventually she gets really into this and she's like you know I kind of like this housewife life what if I start hosting some dinner parties and she creates these lavish amazing dinner parties and eventually all these rich guys who come are like hey do you want to like cater my party and so that's what she starts doing and so she builds a business as a caterer that she said made her a millionaire and her whole stick back then for this catering business was she goes I'm going to make everything by scratch and so westw Connecticut we're about an hour and 10 minutes from New York City at this time people start realizing that she could actually operate on like three or four hours of sleep and so she would go to like catering the catering business by the way it's like that's like the hardest thing on Earth you know it's brutal it's a really hard business to pull off and so she was famous for going to the farmers markets in New York at 4 a.m getting all of her produce and then going in the morning and baking all of her food and so her famous saying as her catering business was basically I make everything from scratch and not only does she just make stuff from scratch one time she saw this brochure that like was doing a recreation of like the pilgrims Thanksgiving and there was like a basket of fruit that was like overflowing and she was like that's what I'm going to do and so she was famous for creating these like Shak cuder Boards of like overflowing meats and fruits and she said something that was actually really inspiring she was like I wanted to turn this into experience and like I wanted to make this like fruit board she was like it sounds trivial but that was my art and I was gonna make like these baskets of fruit overflow with strawberries to show that this table is where like generosity like like you know like and abundance and all this stuff and it's a massive hit she builds us into a big business to the point where a few years in she goes and she caters a I think it was like penguin publishing or something like that like one of these Publishers Pary she caters it and it's a really big deal you know she's doing like the Met uh all these Museum and art museums in New York and this is a big deal that she's doing this catering company or this uh publishing company and they start talking to her and they're like dude you are amazing do you want to write a cookbook for us and so she does and it takes her like a few years like three or four years because she's super Hands-On on writing this book and they were like hey so we're want you to do this cookbook just put in a bunch of recipes and some black and white photos and she was a nobody and she goes not a chance we're doing colored photos and we're actually going to do like 500 photos and I just give me the budget I'll go ahead and I'm gonna like hire a photographer friend and we're going to go and like organize all these photos and take all these lavish photos at my house that I made because we're going to make like the Martha Stewart cookbook where at the time typically it just been recipes she was like no we're going to add in about like my lifestyle we're going to add these photos one of the photos this is like her kitchen look how lavish that is like what do you see the most full kitchen I've ever seen there's literally 9,000 pots and pans hanging above her and then she's surrounded she's like her kitchen looks like a shery board it looks like an overflowing shery board but she's one of she's like a piece of salami in the middle and that's like the whole her whole stick uh basically she she says this she's like I'm going to sell Perfection because she was she was a perfectionist she was actually a pain in the ass to work for and the first book was called entertaining and it was about like entertaining guest basically yeah and like creating an atmosphere of like warmth and things like that and it was a massive hit it sold 650,000 copies what what do you think I feel like Nick Gray is the new Martha Stewart I'm just GNA put that out there what Nick Gray is doing with the 2hour cocktail party I think he's just a he's just a young Martha Stewart right now yeah well and she was like one of the early influencers because this was in the 80s this is when like mass media is really becoming a thing and it's a massive hit and so like these women buy these books because it's not just about cooking it's about like being better being aspirational like perfecting a craft and she sold the [ __ ] out of this life style and it was her lifestyle and she basically said in the documentary she was like I had Visions early on of creating this Martha Stewart Media Company all about me because I'm great like I am what she like she's like she was very confident about that opening up the business plan like all right Mark the stewards Media Company it's about me next page because I'm great next page but she was I mean she was so like there's a lot of bad stuff that has gone on like basically her husband cheats on her she cheats on her husband been her daughter's like dude she was a cold mom people complain working for her they're like dude she's just a [ __ ] [ __ ] and she was like throughout the documentary they get her on camera being rude to her employees and so yeah she's like a perfectionist and she she she was like I'm not I'm not sorry for that I'm a perfectionist wait so fast forward through the business side so she does the cookbook cookbooks a hit massive hit and eventually uh one thing leads to another where Kmart which was just like Kmart to back then it was like you know lower lower status store she partners with them to create like a line of betting and people are like shocked they're like why would this upscale woman do this and it turned out to be a great move it was really cool and then she partners with time and she creates a series of magazines and she's the editor of the magazine it goes really well but she's like I want to own this son [ __ ] and so she raises 85 million dollar and she buys the magazine and three or four years later takes it public and show the financials of her business it was basic I think it was called Martha Stewart om omn media basically the she buys the business and then like something like three years later takes it public the in year three it's doing $130 million a year in 1997 $130 million in revenue and it's a behemoth of a business so basically they've got the TV show they have tons and tons of magazines they have um uh merchandising like the Kmart deal just crushes it and it goes public and she becomes the first ever self-made women's uh billionaire in in America and just annihilates it but then something really bad happens hey let's take a quick break I want to tell you about this report that HubSpot just put together they went and talked to 500 entrepreneurs everybody from solo preneurs just one person just crushing it on their own to people that are scaling up with the team and they wanted to create a entrepreneurship Trend support so they wanted to talk about the strategies they're using problems they're going through and how they're overcoming them and it's a data pack report that they're putting together for free that you can check out so if you're looking for a little help on the entrepreneurship side you looking for that inspiration or maybe a bit of insight on how you could do better check it out the link is in the description below so basically she's worth like 400 500 600 million at this point uh because the stock was going up and down apparently she calls her stock broker she's like hey I want you to sell this one stock so she sells this one stock and it she made like 30 grand off of it turns out a lot of people think that it was insir trading and so the doj like interviews her and figures out this whole thing and does this massive investigation turns out the charges of of of insider trading are dropped they're like you did not Insider trade however so sorry she sold her own stock or she sold a just a different just a r a stock and only 30k so why was it a big deal anyways it was so it was a big deal because we're just uh we we basically there was like Enron and a bunch of things like this were happening at the time and the doj was like any insider trading any like corruption we're going to go we're going like really hard against all this and so she like sell some stock it's suspicious turns out that this the CEO of this of the company whose stock she sold he was in fact corrupt and they're like but you knew him what was going on you knew that this drug wasn't going to pass you sold the stock whatever the doj investigates her and they're like you actually that looks clean it looks like you didn't know anything however when we interviewed you you told us some small fact about how you were on a schedule to sell this stock turns out you weren't on a schedule and so you lied to us and so we were going to put you in federal penitentiary for five months for lying not for insider trading but for lying about this like somewhat ah not that big of a deal fact and so kind of [ __ ] kind of not like she did lie but like she got five months in the federal penitentiary and she's like 50 years old and at the time when all this trial [ __ ] happened that's when we realized that Martha Stewart she's she's kind of bad she's she she's she's bad because there's all these stories where the it comes out she's a little rude and so for example her stock broker has this assistant who would talk to Martha mostly and like there's examples of like of the stock broker's assistant being like dude she was the meanest person ever for example one time she called and I had to put her on hold and I go back to talk to her she goes hey if you don't change that waiting music that tacky waiting music by the next time I call I'm going to have you fired and just hung up just like hung up like there's like repeatedly like a bunch of stories where she just did she was not like very kind to people and that kind of swayed public opinion of her she goes to jail for five months and it sucked it sucked for her it was not good she gets out of jail and she ends up doing Justin Bieber's roast which again changed public perception of her because at this point everyone was like man it's kind of fun seeing Martha Stewart kind of downfall because she was perfect woman like f her it's kind of nice like it brings brings me up to see this I knew she was so perfect yeah but she roasts Justin Bieber and she's just like hilarious she talks about how she like uh uh shanked [ __ ] in prison and how she like made this shank with just like a piece of pencil and some bubble gum and you could do one too at home I'll show you how like it like kind of humanized her it was pretty cool but her getting arrested it decimated the stock so she was like on the documentary she was like I think would have been worth $10 billion but when I got arrested my stock went way down we they ended up selling the company for like $300 million and it was kind of like the it could have been like a great company but it kind of wasn't however throughout this whole thing this whole documentary Martha like has shown time and time again she's a bad bad woman like in in in all sense of the word as in like she's brutal she's smart she's conniving and her St is only going up in your books that's all I'm hearing all I'm hearing is that let's just summarize goodlook lady already off to a good start then goes from model to sales stock broker all right amazing one interesting thing that's cool two interesting things you have my attention third interesting thing self-made first kind of major Trad wife influencer does the cookbooks does it her way is ruthless with the details is a has is has a non-nonsense attitude she's a stickler these are all I mean these are your safe wordss dude like these are all the things that you enjoy so this is really up your alley like I mean like how do you feel about Martha Stewart right now because it sounds like even when she's bad it just made her more good in your books sort of I mean she paid the price so basically like her husband left her her kids like she's got a bad relationship with her children because of uh the way she behaved and she basically she's 83 now by the way uh I didn't realize old she was and like she hasn't had a relationship since her husband and her broke up so she paid the price she there's a cost to be the boss uh you know and she paid it but she is in fact the boss so I do have a lot of respect for her and I also think that there's downsides to achieve what she achieved but I'm shocked you didn't know that did you know any of this like how she's like not really I knew she had like a cookbook or was on TV and that she sold like stuff to women that's kind of the the extent of what I knew about Martha Stewart dude she's great and so another big takeaway and I'll wrap up here is how big of a company you could start and and have just off the back of one person like it was the Martha Stewart brand and she was like into that like a lot of people would be fearful of like having that burden having that on your back of like literally a thousand plus employees and billions of dollars of of value and she was totally into it and she loved it and I love those types of personalities right but it sounds like this company wasn't that good and your numbers table here uh you know by 2001 it says total revenue 295 million net income 21 million um which is obviously that's good that's not nothing but that's not A1 billion doll company to make you know 21 million a year of net income and then it says from 2003 to 2015 which is like three presidents it says consecutive annual losses every year except for one year so so was this really a good business or was this actually just a lot of work for nothing no it was good I mean you have to think of a few things one you know it was making $300 million a year in revenue and a lot of it came from publishing and Publishing means subscription magazines so like that's like pretty good but then the internet came and just completely like obliterated that industry I mean that was like magazines are probably like the worst industry to be in so like yeah there's a lot of wh ifs and the timing was such that she got arrested and also like you know Amazon was created and the internet was created so yeah there's a lot of like what ifs but I feel like if she was I think she was like 30 years too early like I think if she had the internet she could have become a juggernaut because it sounds like her talent and her ruthlessness that combination was going to serve her well and it just she needed the she needed a better medium if she could have just owned her own Instagram and Tik Tok channels and built everything off the back back of that you know she I think she would have been the number one sort of like women's or mom influencer she arguably was that anyways of her era but the market 100x yeah yeah I mean and like I think a lot of these like big celebrities I think it was a little bit easier to be a big celebrity uh in the 80s 90s and early 2000s because there was less of them now anyone with a cell phone can become a celebrity in like six or 12 months um so it's hard to say but but by the way her businesses her businesses still doe like a billion a year in sales okay gotcha uh you have something on your notes Here typical day of 60-year-old Martha Stewart yeah read that it says she's 60 but she looks a decade younger she's she's been up since 4:30 a.m. she answers her email at 5 takes a three-mile walk with her trainer at 6 she tours her garden at 7 as when she tours her garden she's thrilled to discover a duck and 13 ducklings in the swimming pool by 7:30 she's whipping up corn GRL for a visiting water foul I don't even know what these words are an animal an animal building a wooden ramp to help them get in and out of the pool a duck okay she's doing all this stuff for a duck her TV crew arrives at 8 her and makeup 8:30 and then she's shooting her TV segment by 9:00 a.m. yeah dude she's crazy czy dud I literally woke up like 19 minutes ago and uh I rolled out of bed and I put on this hat and then I started I click play I don't think I don't think I'm built for this she's a machine you know how like people say stories of like how Trump can only operate on 3 hours of sleep that's like a real thing by the way there's like a it's like I forget what the name of it it's like a a thing she's another person she's famous for only sleeping like 3 hours a night perfect segue can I tell you what my best topic was that I wanted to talk to you about yeah OIC for sleep so there's a guy uh his blog is isaac. net and he wrote this post about sleeplessness and he basically says that there is a set of people that are famous who have the short sleeper jeans a set of jeans for where you know about four to five hours a night is a full night's rest for them and he says that you know Mozart Thomas Edison Sigman Freud Margaret Thatcher Obama and he's like even my my lab labmate this guy's a researcher he's like have this thing called short sleeper syndrome and people thought that short sleeper syndrome would be you sleep less and maybe you're able to operate that way but you know it's got to be bad for you sleep we know is sort of the best thing for you it restores the brain and the body and all your function and so these people must be dying younger and have more disease right and it's like no actually they don't these people just simply have the benefit without the cost they sleep you know they need about three hours less sleep than the rest of us but they um they don't pay the price in terms of you know the health consequences of that and so he goes on this post and he basically outlines that who who are these people by the way in this photo so he says um you know my favorite family is this family called the Johnson's from Utah and the Johnson from Utah are a set of researchers and I think a bunch of them have this short sleeper genetic makeup and so they've been researching this for a while and it's about you know 1% of people have this thing where you're you don't need as much sleep and it does not seem detrimental to your health or your productivity and they've studied why is this what is it is it one gene um is it not and they basically like there's four kind of like protein changes that they've noticed you know very in the glutamate receptor grm1 blah blah blah so there's these four things and then they've done some tests in mice and others where they do like Knockouts so they'll they'll knock out one of the genes and they'll see if it you know makes the the mouse sleep less or sleep more and they try understand can you do that to a like when you say knockout does that mean like you're a living being or when they reproduce a living being you could that's how the body works you could just like I I said that with so much confidence for somebody who has no idea but I think that you could do that I'm a biom major you could check that that's a fact Jack but I don't know if you could do I don't know if this done at the embryo or in the living thing but point is they've tested this in Mouse models Mouse models don't always apply to human models so there's some question there but the the researcher sort of points out actually you know usually when Mouse model when when things that work in mice don't work in humans it's because they tried it and it worked for the first time in mice and then it takes a long time to even try it in humans and maybe it won't work he's like in this case we're observing it actually in humans and then we went back to mice and tried to recreate that um those genetic mutations or those gen genetic changes and so this is really exciting so what he's talking about is like in the same way that we found drugs like OIC which could modify your appetite it could change your your need for food in a way that had all these Downstream health benefits right you change your need for food you reduce your need for food now you eat obesity goes down they've seen that it uh you know helps with things like addiction to alcohol there's like all these other like things that people are noticing with these that's the OIC case this guy's saying you could do the same with sleep like if and is this guy Isaac is he the researcher or is he just blogging on this he's a researcher who is blogging about this WOW got it and he's basically saying that like potentially we could create something that does the same thing that how OIC reduced your need for food that we could reduce your need for sleep in and make you these people who have this already where they don't suffer the consequences of less sleep and he's like you know you do the math and you're like if you're saving three or four hours a night of sleep you basically it's like the world's best longevity trade so what most people trying to do with longevity is like oh if I'm living till 80 can I live till 90 if I'm living 90 can I live till 100 100 100 and they're trying to push off the like that last marginal decade of poor health where you can't walk as much you can't see as well you know if you're in pain all that stuff you're trying to push that back as far as you can this would make it so that you actually just live better like the days where you're healthy you have more days you're awake from more of the time and it's the equivalent of an extra 10 years but you get the 10 years not at the end you get it sort of all along the way while you're in your best health of your life and that would be the promise of this and so how exciting is that I feel like that it's possible that somebody's going to make an OIC for sleep and it's going to allow us to instead of needing eight hours I can sleep for five and feel just as good as I would on eight he says uh this is like adding 10 more years to your life an 80y year lifespan eight hours a day is a sleep compared to 80 year 80 years with four hours of sleep that's 10 years uh this is amazing and on top of that by the way there's people who said suffer from insomnia and narcolepsy and like there's all these actual like sleep apnea there's all these things that affect people's sleep um maybe you could alleviate those along the way right like if you know there's there's thousands of Americans who have those problems could you also improve those okay first of all this is amazing this is a great find I'm reading his blog his writing is really great it doesn't write like a this is why I was shocked that he's a researcher because he's I think like there's like a quote where he goes this is crazy uh like that he they don't they don't normally say things like that yeah they don't have personalities usually this has profound implications by the way he's 22 years old he's a PhD student at MIT exploring brain simulations as alternative path to beneficial Ai and in the past he skipped out of high school in rural Austria to graduate early in his Gap year he created a $1 million doll nonprofit and ran the most viral Tech Conference of the year that had Sam wman and others come he's uh self-taught Mandarin last year and uh did his undergrad at Berkeley in two years guy's a winner doing well Annie owns isaac. net like great domain name Isaac with a K this guy's great man well what I was going to say was is this I've never I've I've heard of you know that that Gene a little bit uh that you're discussing but it's just funny that there's just some kid with a well a 22-year-old with a personal blog and this is the first time that I've ever heard about this is this that's what I'm saying it's fascinating but if he if he's just talking about his blog is this like something that actually has um like why is there not more press or or press releases on this topic is it actually leg now we just broke it dude this was the Tipping Point you're going to see other people working on this you're going to see people talking about this there's going to be misinformation everywhere it's going to be great this story is awesome just because I like Isaac and also I would like to do uh I would like to not sleep would you rather be skinny like o zic and not and eat less or be like chub or whatever sleep only five hours instead of eight I don't give a [ __ ] I would be the fattest man on Earth to do that no I'm joking but like that is a that is a way better superpower to need less sleep to get back three hours a time every day that's debatable I think that people will always prefer to be skinny over uh sleep less sleep oh people are dumb that's so dumb if they if they prefer to be skny over having extra three hours of life every day if the average 25-year-old if you're like look hot or live to 90 versus 80 they're going to choose hot over sleep any day of the week well this is why we don't ask 25y olds questions the brain is not fully formed yet this is a great find his blog uh according to similar web just shot up to 125,000 uh visitors in October who what did he like before it was nothing he published this in November so that's kind of cool the uh so Ben found this and he sent it to our friend so our friend invested in a company that made a glp1 drug and like sold for millions of dollars and so he sent this to him because he's like oh you like you did that early OIC thing before OIC was like a known thing like 7even years before he invested in this company that was going to work on on that and it paid off in a big way so he sent it to him and that guy was like I don't know how you found this this is the best thing I've read all year like I'm so excited about what you just sent me and it was such a great example of Ben being Ben where Ben has on one side a really curated feed where he'll find interesting things like this like he'll be f he doesn't follow many people but he'll be following a guy like this Isaac guy and then he knows who to Route the information to and it's he's like a he's like FedEx like he doesn't touch the package like when I when I get this I immediately start doing research I write notes I go talk about it I'm not passing it to somebody smarter Ben's like he he's like a FedEx guy the package comes off the conveyor belt he grabs the box tosses in the truck drives it to the address drops it off and doesn't ask any questions about what's inside he just knows that's useful for you I think this is useful for you and he just does that all day I had him like add me to all these group chats like he he was always texting people but I said yo just add me I just want to be a part of these so now I'm in probably like 60 group chats where it's me Ben and a mutual like acquaintance or friend and he's just doing this all day he's just routing packets to each to different people about yeah I think you're into this kind of thing that that that's ridiculous how is he gonna monetize it can he ever monetize this yeah dude we monetize this phenomenally this is the secret of Ben he just tries to be useful and then he'll be like hey yeah um remember that guy like you met a year ago who you then didn't talk to ever again I'm like yeah I think so I think I remember that guy he was cool he's like yeah so I've been texting him you know we text daily and he's got this new thing and it's taking off and like he wants us to invest he's not letting anyone else in and then we invest in it it's it's incredible how this Karma just comes back tenfold for Ben and he never asks for anything he never asks it's amazing he texts me uh like a fair bit like just like um saw this thing you might like it like you know so I'm the recipient of some of these things and I I hate texting like I hate like being at my computer and like constantly having to go back and forth with 10 different people which is how a lot of people's computers look right now where you're like it's between slack and messages you're just like going back and forth with 15 or 20 people at all times and you're like what did I do all day today I just like I just shitchat it it t and so I don't like doing it do you fall into that trap like throughout the day where you're like dude I just like texted people all day yeah I like slack because I like my projects that I'm working on but I don't text much I'm a very bad texter and if anyone's out there who's texting me I really apologize I probably have not texted you back so I'm I'm prolifically bad at it Ben is prolifically great at it and that combination has really helped the combination has really helped and now people don't they just bypass me alt together they go to him and it hurts my feeling sometimes I'm like wait I thought I would friends with this person but now I understand why because he's just a better person he's a better texture in fact he he he was like I need to make a shirt called I reply he goes because that's my thing dude I reply and he like it's pretty easy and I was like you should write like the modern day how to win friends and influence people because that's what he does he wins friends and influences people with the most basic the most basic of things and I was like you couldn't sell a like the thing you do creates like tons of value tens of millions of dollars value for us you couldn't even teach people this cuz you you would say what you do out loud and they'd be like that was it I showed up for the seminar for that um that's basic it's basic as hell and but that's what he does and it works that's insane I think it's funny I uh you by the by the way Google Isaac Freeman very good-looking young stylish black dude this guy's got it all this guy's got it all this guy's if he just becomes an astronaut he's basically the modern day James B oh man he's got like cool glasses and a jawline [ __ ] yeah give him over um what you said you had a bunch of exciting things you want to do all by the way you know we don't judge a book by its cover so like you know looks looks do matter let's be clear uh we try not to judge people by their looks first but once we take a look at what you do we then go take a look at how you look and it either is like a plus 100 or it's a minus 100 it's a huge multiplier on my opinion of you and how much I'm going to remember you afterwards I will never forget this guy yeah like if he were dorky looking I'd be like yeah makes sense checks out and then I see what he looks like and I'm like a right uh it's tough to be like looking at but by the way most people when they have an avatar as their Twitter profile it's because they're goofy looking and the Avatar is better looking than he's making me question everything like there's a reason I have a cartoon profile picture all right look at me if you're on YouTube Look At Me This is why I have a cartoon profile picture okay that's the that's the rule it's like uh when someone quotes you Revenue they would have said profit if they had it right if somebody talks about users they would have quoted Revenue if they had it normally if somebody's got the looks they're going to put their face as the profile picture this guy defies all all convention I asked someone what the revenue was recently and they were like eight figures if you include the dot z00 and I was like that's pretty funny it was that was pretty good um you want to do another thing yeah all right I got some cool stuff um oh you got to do this poly Market whale okay yeah this is all right so this is the Billy of the week key the [Applause] music million dollars isn't cool you know what's cool a billion dollars so you've heard the story I think but can I just explain a little bit of the detail here amazing I read I read about it a little bit do do we even know who this person is yeah so the election was happening what 10 days ago or so and the big news was sort of I guess like there's a battle going on there's Republicans versus Democrats great there's Trump and kala great they were supposed to be head dead but there was there was an undercard to the pay-per-view and so who was the undercard okay if Trump and KLA are the main event then I think the undercard a lot of it was like mainstream media versus social media right you had like Twitter and blogs versus MSNBC and whatever and they were they were giving you different narratives uh right so you know Joe Trump and uh Vance go on Joe Rogan uh kamla goes on Saturday Night Live and you know the view or 60 Minutes or like you know these like traditional medium so that was one battle that was going on by the way who would have thought like you seen like theovon uh being like a needle mover insane right I was saying this the other day I think that going on theovon needs to be part of the standard for an election like I need to know if my president's going to be a good hang or not and I think Theo is the one who could save us there yeah that was insane so under that then you have like the billionaire backers you got Elon on one side you got Mark Cuban on the other and it's like they're going around they're promoting they're using their money and their voice to to do it what was the other battles one of the other battles was polls versus crypto prediction markets so the polls were telling a story at the time pre-election the polls were saying raise your thin margin toss up these swing states too close to call it's a 50-50 election right now like we don't we it is too hard to tell who's G to win and the prediction markets which were people betting money were saying something different they were saying 6535 Trump going to win and they're different things right a poll is you know you go out and you ask people who are you going to vote for a prediction Market is who's going to get the most votes so they do tell different things but the reality is still the same which is that if the polls were accurate that was a 50-50 tossup it's going to be a razor thin margin then the betting markets shouldn't have such a big sprint there shouldn't be a a big favorite versus a a big Underdog and what was the poly Market spread I think it was like 75 25 uh no it was a little less about it was about 63 Trump but then it got to 65 and then like as the election started when the news was saying you know we're still it's still too early the the odds were just jetting in Trump's Direction they they were they they knew earlier than than the the the exit polls or the the news was willing to report about how much of a landslide this was going to be for Trump which it was okay so before it happened there was a question of like is the prediction Market actually predictive and there was some legitimate skepticism so the pro side was um the betting Market versus the poll Market the betting just like even just alone should we be should we care what poly Market says and um on one hand po Market being the platform where you could take Market exactly and so you uh the plus side would be to say well these are people betting their own money so skin in the game and so if you see a lot more action coming in on one side that means the sort of the wisdom of the crowds and the actual free market believes the odds are are this and that might be better than just the polls where people say they're just saying what they're going to vote for and it's a small sample but who knows maybe they're lying maybe it's just too small of a sample to know maybe um it's not indicative of there's no skin in the game there so on one hand you said skin in the game on the other hand you would say poly Market never heard heard of it banned in the US so all the betting action was from International so over3 billion doar was bet on the election none of this was Americans because you can't use poly Market in America then it's also crypto holders right because poly Market is a crypto betting thing so you're like oh maybe there's a bias crypto holders are more libertarian maybe they're going to go more more right right right leaning and so it's and Trump is pro crypto yeah so it's like maybe they're voting on what they wish for and not what it actually is okay so there was some some question marks then there was one more then the news came out and said you know we can't trust poly Market because it's manipulated manipulated how it's manipulated because a couple of whales are betting heavily on Trump and that's swinging the odds so it's actually this is not what the the the crowds think it's really a couple of whales that are influencing this and they saw that and you you can see on poly Market the SI like can I oh someone just put this million dollar bet in I can go on poly market right now and look at the top 10 bers and what they are bet on how much volume they've bet this year and how much their p&l is are they up or down so theo4 I think is the biggest one on the uh platform and he has made a profit of $22 million this year exact so that's that was one that's one user but you can go user by user and you can see oh this guy's just betting on everything or this guy's one huge beted or whatever right so you can go look at anybody any any better pel on on poly market so what they found was they were like hey there's a couple of bets here that were in the tens of Millions on Trump and actually it all came from the same guy and what they were thinking was that there's four big accounts that bet 28 million and actually turns out now after the fact the guy came out and said it he had 11 accounts and he he bet 40 something million and he um 40 or 50 million and he made um about $80 million of profit actually sorry I don't know the exact bet amounts but I know he made he made $80 million profit in the end a french guy I think a french guy so they were like who is this French wh and the story behind it's pretty interesting because this guy was a Trader he's like in he's like in finance he lived in the US at one point uh but basically he's like he's like I'm trying to remain anonymous I'm trying not by the way how une Earth would a journalist find this person that seems really hard that's a great scoop so on poly Market you could see the bets so you can go see wow there's a huge bet then you go look at the account you try to figure out whose wallet is this and because crypto is there's a public liser you can actually Trace back and try to find it and there's a company called chainalysis do you know chainalysis uh I've heard of it just like as a headline they're basically the the government goes to chainalysis and says we need to know who owns this wallet and they can go and do the forensic analysis of every transaction that wallet's done and tries to figure out the root wallet and who owns that wallet and so that's this is like a 10 billion dollar company chal we have to do a breakdown of this company this sounds fun yeah they're they're a fascinating company and so they came out and they did this analysis and there's like this web of the accounts and like so take a look dude this is like all the best Stu like crime and crypto stories are the best stories and so like working at this company would be super exciting I know but you know what I mean totally so they come out and they say all right well dude how did you know why did you make such a massive bet on Trump and this is where the story gets really interesting he says he he's like I didn't trust the polls but I trust polling what do you mean he goes I commissioned my own polls there's a french guy who commissioned polls in America to inform his own bet and what he did was he paid a polling company and he said I want you to go and I want you to ask them but don't ask them who they vote who they're gonna vote for because that's what polls often ask that is uh what do traditional polls ask are you likely to vote if you're going to vote who who are you likely to vote for are you certain of that you know whatever is there anything that's going to change your mind would you they also ask who do I think they ask it in a weird way as well I think they also ask who do you think your friend is going to vote for that's what this guy did so this guy did was called the neighbor method and what he says is he says don't ask them who they're going to vote for I don't want to people are indirect people don't want to reveal their own preferences but if you ask them a specific question which is who do you expect your neighbor to vote for they will indirectly reveal their own preferences and what they believe is going to happen and he believed that the neighbor method is a more predictive method and when he did this he commissioned this poll he paid a PO paid a major us pollster to go do these polls for him uh just like you know the DNC and the RNC they'll pay pollsters to go run their independent polls that they're not reporting to the public and um he wanted to measure this neighbor effect and what he found was that the results were quote mindblowing to the favor of trump it showed a trump Landslide and so he thought now this is mispriced the media is telling you that this is 50-50 razor thin but actually my polling is showing that actually this's going to be a a major Landslide for Trump it's overwhelmingly in favor of trump so now the bet is mispriced so he places this huge bet on Trump and it turns out he's correct and his final quote was you know public opinion would have been better prepared if the latest polls had measured using the neighbor effect and um he specifically didn't just bet on the overall Victory he bet on specific swing states where he thought the SW people think this state is closer than it's actually going to be it's going to be more in favor of trump using this neighbor method which is just insane um and now of course the French this guy nailed it like just two words bour my [ __ ] a first of all what I respect about this is everything go I don't respect everything about it I don't love I don't love gambling like this but people who have conviction on some like they do their own analysis and they're like no this is the answer even though all the quote smart people or everyone's the the EST lishment is saying this but I I did my own research and then that he did the big part which is he bet $30 million or whatever of his own money I think that is like those types of people fascinate me because that takes so much conviction yeah exactly this is I mean the guts that it the the brains and the guts right that and that that's kind of I think the theme of the year is like you see someone like Elon who basically swings the election who catches a rocket out out you know catches a rocket with some Chopsticks you know is working on self-driving cars helped co-found open AI which is changing the world the guy is just you know like firing on all cylinders and it's like why what is it what is different about this guy and it's the combination of the brain and the balls right like there are other people as smart as Elon Musk there are other people who have you know the risk-taking G you know guts as Elon Musk but the combination is rare and then you add on top of that the willingness to you know absolutely work to the Bone as well right and then you add on top of that like sacrifice your own life yeah you so he's you know top .1% in like five things and then it's like oh if you just multiply 0.1% times you know five times over and over again you end up with like one in 10 billion which is like oh that's actually the ratio we do have one Elon out of the entire human population I thought it was impressive I was like Justin timberlink you can sing dance and act and you're funny like you know what I mean super bad Eli just really he stepped it up it's a great call um is poly Market gonna sustain after this of course not right what okay so I've been a big poly Market fan I was using poly Market before they banned it like you know way back in the day you're also a little bit of a DJ yeah uh but I think a lot of people are I how much money have you in uh you've first by the way you called this Gam I don't believe that this is gambling um by well like for example uh you own stock do you believe that you're gambling gambling when you when you buy a stock I guess what what are you doing when you buy a stock right like yeah you are I guess um I guess You' have to say that there's it's not as binary but there's levels or like there it's it's a scale so but yeah you are just like if you buy car like you and I it exists on a spectrum yes so so like you know the with a stock the chair the you know the the oldfashioned way of looking at it is I'm not buy I'm not gambling I'm buying a piece of ownership in a company that produces goods and for it's like yeah all right cool nobody really in practice treats it like that meaning you're not sitting there like you know you're you're not sitting there waiting for dividends you're not you're not trying to uh you know own this piece of this company because you think it's going to you know exit at a later date when it's a public stock already right like you're basically saying I believe that you know the future earnings of this company are going to be X and that that's why owning this is good because the the share price is going to go up because their earnings are going to go up and they're maybe going to go up at a faster rate than the current price of the earning Uh current price of the stock IND indicates that's what you you're supposed to buy right you're supposed to buy buy a stock that you think is going to you know appreciate over time I think that poly Market has the ability to do that in a bunch of interesting ways so first there are the other speculation slash betting gambling type of use cases so speculating on prices of things speculating on sports game you know Sports outcomes of games right like sports betting is obviously a huge deal so there's those use cases there is an interesting thing so I'm guessing you didn't read vitalik's blog recently about uh about this that's an accurate guess vitalic who's the creator of ethereum wrote a great blog post falic one of my favorite entrepreneurs and thinkers on the plan so the blog post is called I guess from prediction markets into into Finance info Finance so he's uh he he's like you know I have written a lot and I've supported poly market and many of you who know me might be surprised by this because vitalic is sort of notoriously like not into the like crypto Casino side of of life like he's not price based he's not trying to get rich as like his primary motivation he's kind of like a prude he's a purist and so like it'd be like why why do you care so much about these like prediction markets just people gambling who cares and he's like because I don't see it as that I actually think that there's another category here that's overlooked and it's called in info Finance information finance and he gives some examples so he's like poly Market was two things at once he goes on one hand it's a betting site for the few people that want to bet and gamble but for the rest of us we could look at how the gamblers are betting and that would it for them it served as a news site it was like oh wow Trump is doing better Trump is improving and the same way that the polls are supposed to be part of the news the prediction markets were actually better news information so it was information Finance he's like that's the first level which was even if you're not participating in the betting trying to trying to make a book it is very useful that other people are doing that because it it's a new it's another source of information he's like it's not it should not be the only source of information but it should be another one he talks about the elections in Venezuela how like you know basically he was watching how people were protesting how it was getting manipulated and blah blah blah how poly marker was actually a very useful source of information for him in understanding what was going on in Venezuela from an informational point of view all right so that was one then he's like okay what's the other use case he's like so um imagine a company so like you know I don't know if you saw like Chipotle or Starbucks uh like Starbucks just hired the Chipotle CEO did you see that yeah and he's um the headline is that he's working from home even though he's making everyone else go back to work right yeah he's like private jetting in and out but like this guy is kind of famous for like he trims the menu he cuts costs and he like he basically improves margins that's what this guy's known for and so the amazing thing was that guy he's that he's that guy and so like he's him when it comes to public markets because when he switched teams they paid him a bunch of money and I was like wow what a huge stock package for a CEO like $100 million or whatever whatever the number was but the stock jumped like20 billion or something like it was like a I'm making up numbers here because I I didn't plan to talk about this but like the stock jumped in a disproportionate way it based on just the news that this guy was coming over and so like it was a great trade for them to overpay this guy this talent because it immediately improved the the overall value of the company just the news of him joining and so vitalic actually was like just like there's today we're looking at these as prediction markets you could actually use this as a decision Market meaning a company or a group of people could set could basically in the way that that guy Theo paid for a private poll to get information you could actually set up a prediction Market maret and say a decision market and say should we hire this CEO or what will the sh not should we what will the share price be in six months if we hire Brian Nichols and if the share price expectation is really high it tells you in advance without having to hire him yet what the market reaction is going to be to making this decision does that make sense and so you can actually create decision markets and it would be worth basically paying to paying participants to go pick a side and make a bet in order to gather information that would help you make a better decision about what you're going to do and so he's like there's um you can actually improve judgment if you were to if you were to make this decision and so I I thought that was pretty interesting and he talks about he goes through you know uh how this might a how info Finance might affect all these other things so for example scientific peer review so right now in science you submit a paper and there's something called the replication crisis which is that famous results that end up being you know go into books and in the news or whatever then they can't be reprodu that study can't be reproduced it's like is it even like the definition of good science is that it's a reproducible experiment but that's not happening and in fact there's not really a big incentive to go reproduce these because the incentive is come out with a new finding you get published you get the glory you get the funding for your lab spending your resources to reproduce a uh somebody else's science somebody else's big news it's not really a good use of time and he talks about how prediction markets could actually create incentives for people to go and try to reproduce these studies because you could have people betting on if this is reproducible or not and so you you'll be able to profit off of knowing that this this is going to be reproduced or not so it's pretty interesting to see how that might be applied in all these other ways I haven't read this other than what you just told me and skimming it here first of all this is like an amazing blog post I need to go read this second if you go to his blog if you go to like his other posts he's publishes like a in-depth post like every three days how amazing is this that we have access to a genius like this who just like shares his thoughts and and by the way they're like if you read just the headlines and then click the Articles they are not just like half-ass blog these are like in-depth things that he's publishing a [ __ ] ton how special of an era are do we have where we can like go and just read his thoughts that you get access to this yeah and the beautiful thing about his stuff which is I think hard to because you know I was thinking about this with podcasts it's amazing now that there's podcasts with you know like when we started this I felt like there was a slight differentiator in the business podcast space because we were not just journalists nor were we like never hasbin we had like done it we had started many companies failed and we had you know sold companies we had done real things and so that was kind of like a uh interesting oh what if you actually had a podcast from from entrepreneurs who were actually like more successful than the average podcast let's say I think you're looking for the term for us by us we foooo it yeah but now you you have Allin you have now you get to see billionaires you know doing this Reed hofman has a podcast you know Zuck is going on podcast there like who doesn't have a podcast at this point right um and I think that's really cool and the same thing's happening in sports athlete current athletes past athletes now have sports podcasts whereas before the only Sports podcast you get was like you know hardcore fan in his in his b mom's basement you know ranting about his team or you know a journalist and now you have this like this third thing and the third thing is like somebody who's actually been there and done that who gives their perspective not to say it's always better but like it's interesting that that's now accessible to us yeah but the problem with something like let's say Allin or or other podcasts like that is like you have to always parse the agenda so it's like wow this guy's really bearish on nuclear and really pro pro solar that you go look into shas's profile and it's like oh wow made like enormous bets on solar and like that's his he's talking his book in a way right and it's okay it's okay to talk your book but it's you have to constantly do that like underwriting yourself as a listener to be like are they you know what's the bias here yeah the beautiful thing about vitalic is that the guy is such an Uber nerd that like you can actually take him at face value and it's so nice to have somebody you could take at face value and other people might disagree I don't care I take him at face value and I followed this guy for like you know eight years straight now and I've this guy's done nothing to make me think he's just trying to pump his bags in fact he actively does things against his bags you know not pumping ethereum or talking about what where it lacks or what's slow about it and you know under promising what it's going to be and I think that that is uh that's great that we have access to this guy who is not trying to take something from us in the process that's a very good speech on this guy I'm I'm gonna like I don't even think you could subscribe to his like I don't there's not even an email form dude his blog like so he publishes on all right so listen October 29th October 26th October 23rd October 20th he's been writing these uh posts a lot and those posts that I just said I just put them into a word counter uh one of them was 6,000 words now I don't know like I don't know how Bitcoin the dramatic look you just gave me when you said that like I was supposed to like audibly gasp dude that's so much work I've written a lot of blog posts a 6,000 word blog post would take me 40 hours probably right it's so much work when you when you are this guy and you create ethereum is it one of the things where like you've created it and you can now walk away or does it like is it like a house and you got to like maintain it no he's actively working on it like I don't know is it like a thing where you're like I mean it's bigger than just him obviously but like yeah he's he's you actively dedicated like re roof it every once in a while I don't know how these things work like ethereum I don't know like did you ethereum was like a 10-e road map and so he's just it's not even like re-roofing it it's like building a hotel one floor at a time and people are staying in the hotel but you told them from the beginning this is a 50 story hotel and I I haven't even built all those other things that we're going to need in order for this to work like there's no elevators yet I know we're going to make elevators for now we take stairs that's like the transaction fees and all that the reason I'm asking is how on Earth is he writing this much stuff while doing like a full-time job because ethereum doesn't work like that it's not like he's sitting there coding all day or managing people like it's not a company it's like a nonprofit Foundation open source project of which he's like a steward and a champion but he's not like he doesn't have like 25 direct reports you know what I mean does he have a girlfriend or wife yet I'm not sure I've seen a bunch of pictures but it's so hard with him to tell what's a meme and what's like reality because he's like so memeable that like when Bitcoin when ethereum price goes down and then they posted him pictures of him they're like God damn it it's because he has a girlfriend by the way like is his girlfriend just going to be like which way is it g to go so it's November 13th we're recording this exactly one month ago I came on this podcast and I said Tim can I give you my one minute case for Bitcoin and you literally rolled your eyes and audibly groaned at me and said haven't you already done that like you you're talking about why you like Bitcoin again I just want to say the price is up 47% since I did that rant all right well are you are you like uh that are you uh like that dude are you the French guy did you you had you were you smart or just or were you smart and ballsy or just smart go back and listen to it it's in the episode called did the creator of Bitcoin get unmasked at the 30 minute Mark 30 minutes no I'm not debating if you said that I'm saying did you uh make saying go listen to the case and say did I get lucky or was I smart did I have I have reason what I'm asking what I'm asking is did you make the bet oh of course what do you mean well what I'm saying is did you just say it was going to be good or did you actually invest your own money into oh dude I'm poly Market bro I'm skin in the game does Po and does gambling on poly market mean you have Bitcoin well it's like poly Market versus a poll a poll is just saying what you're gonna do poly Market is putting your money up saying what you think is gonna actually happen I put my money up and thought what said what I thought was going to happen yeah I mean it's had a hell of a run um almost as good as paler everything's [ __ ] crazy right now though um like everything when I look everything a little too crazy everything's too crazy uh like it it wouldn't be I don't know anything about anything but it seems like it'd be a good time to make the opposite prediction so yeah you were right it's just like how long are you going to be right for right now everything is just like insane yeah yeah and of course these are like you know one month fluctuations are nothing but I guess the the thing I the reason I thought it was bullish was because it was the same reason that the thing is pumping right now because there was a whole bunch of like big things like for example that the government was going to be pro pro Bitcoin which was always the biggest risk of Bitcoin was like oh even if it's even if you're right about the technology being better the government will never allow this and I was like dude the guy who's going to become president is saying not only will he allow it he's bought and sold by the crypto donors now and both both sides are and like I don't know if you saw like the Congress and like the whatever house representative Senate all that [ __ ] there's like there's like 140 Pro crypto people now like in in active government which is like you know that number was was Zero you know seven years ago and I just felt like these things were not priced in properly now they're talking about a Bitcoin strategic reserve for the country itself it's like these things once you go in it's it's almost impossible to unwind these things and I just thought that when a top two or three risk gets drisk that should change your your underwriting on the price and I thought that that wasn't happening for some reason the price was flat and people weren't paying attention to that one fact what a world is so in summary I was right thank you you were you were right you you absolutely were right everything is insane at the moment I hope your prediction will be true for many many many more months and many more years but it's definitely making me nervous at the moment everything is insane is that where we end that's where we end it's been a fantastic podcast to Martha Stewart to bitcoin to the poly Market whale that's called thank you for your service hot hot heat the hot hot heat was served you're welcome all right that's it that's the pod [Music]

what I really thought about was when does it end you know like at eight arrests at 10 arrests at 300 lb at 350 pounds I just really thought about that and I was like what does my life look like in three years and four years and five years if I keep doing this and that terrified me enough to immediately change literally everything [Music] okay Leila welcome to the show it's exciting to see you here we've had Alex on a couple of times and uh I don't know you guys are pretty Kick-Ass we've we've we you you're like one of the few business like power couples celebrity couples that are out there in the public did you ever think you would be doing that like did you ever think oh I'll be the kind of like Guru influencer person who's going to be out there giving advice or giving Frameworks or trying to be helpful to people is that something you something you saw yourself doing not in the beginning because I think I just really enjoyed running the company and then I think once I realized that after a certain point the impact I wanted to have I would it would be required that I learned that skill and that it would be something that would be transferable to what I did day-to-day as well then that was when I was like okay I think this is important for me to learn because what I realized is I can be as good as I am at running a business but if I'm not as good at running it as I am talking about it then it doesn't really matter if I can't communicate my abilities then that in itself is a limiter for me teaching my team and transferring that skill to somebody else whether it be an audience my team a friend whatever it might be I feel like when I hear you talk it's like okay You' You've Really Got A a super strong sense of how you like to operate it's like you got it together and a system that works for you and that comes through experience it comes to trial and error but let's rewind before you had all that and let you tell your story a little bit because there's going to be people who are listening to this don't know your full story I don't know your full story to be honest I love this one tweet that I came out of the research who said you can't skip the struggle if you want the story so I want to use that you can't skip the struggle if you want the story so in telling your story let's start with the struggle can you start where you didn't have it all together you weren't this sort of business Terminator you you were struggling you were trying to figure it out can you start there yeah I would say that you know ever since I was like a teenager I always wanted to get into entrepreneurship mostly because I had my father he was a 10-e professor you know he did everything by the book and he honestly miserable and so I really just felt like that wasn't the way to go I just didn't know what the way was and I got lost along the way so much so that like you know when I was 19 I had been arrested six times I was drinking doing drugs I was 230 pounds like my life was going nowhere I was flunking out of college and that was when I really when I turned my life around just learning how to live my life in accordance with my goals and values rather than my feelings and that was really what taught me a lot of discipline I ended up losing almost 100 pounds I moved across the country by myself from Michigan to California and I went to get go to California because I wanted to pursue a career in Fitness um because then I had finished school for exercise science useless but nonetheless I had finished school for it so um you just said you just said a thing that that like in a movie would have been like 60 minutes and you did it in like 60 seconds I want to zoom in so you were like I'm 230 lbs I'm drinking I don't know what I want to do with my life I'm basically single broke and out of shape right that's kind of like the start and then you were like so then I decided I'm going to start living life in terms of my goals and then I did I lost 100 pounds and like all right hold on I've been there before I know that there's something that happens in between those right if it was so easy to just live in accordance with my goals I probably would have been doing it earlier yeah there must have been some wakeup call some sort of moment some sort of a tough conversation with yourself where you decided to to start making a shift what was that moment there was two moments the first one which was like okay I want to stop being a fat ass is I was at a party or I went to a party it was my friend's birthday party and it was college right and so then she's like I'm going to invite these people which had been our friends in high school and I was like oh gosh that's embarrassing because like I'm pretty overweight now and so it's like I hope nobody says anything but nobody's gonna say anything because that's really rude right and so there's we have this party everyone's drinking and I'm walking past a a couple of guys I went to high school with and and going to the bathroom and I hear a guy and he's like what a shame and I was like I was like what and he was really drunk and I was like what's a shame and he was like man he's like you know it really sucks because like you know you were really pretty but you're just really fat now oh and I remember in that no but here's the thing in that moment yeah um in that moment I was like the my my internal voice actually was like he's right and I was like I hate that that what he said is true and so it was in that moment that I was like I don't want somebody to be able to say that about me anymore and avoiding the situation avoiding real life is not it's not cutting in so I remember I went home and I like you know like wrote this Facebook post in pure rage it was like you won't see me anymore I'm going dark and like expect not to hear from me um and I really was just like I can't keep overeating I can't keep not taking care of myself I had stopped working out basically stopped working out started eating like [ __ ] and drank all the time and if you do all those things at once like you just continue to gain weight and that was really the moment that did it for me because I just the fact that my response was I agree with him it wasn't like I'm mad at him I'm anything I was like man he told the truth and I think that if you don't want people to say bad stuff about you then change I'd rather just change the situation than try and avoid people yeah you type up the Facebook message you say I'm going dark did you have a plan or you just had the fuel at that time I just had the fuel I mean and the funny thing is I remember uh my plan was this just eat half of what you're eating not the worst plan it really wasn't and so like I actually would just take what I was eating and I would just eat half and and that worked for me and it it I lost about 60 pounds that way and so you know the other 40 then I got into macros and lifting and all that stuff and that's really when like that took me on like where I've probably been since then the second moment was the sixth time that I was arrested so I had been out at College you know drinking blacked out I wake up I am in my my bedroom at my parents house so like my childhood bedroom and I was like oh my God I don't know what happened and I rolled over I was in bed like pounding headache feel like [ __ ] and there's a a ticket for my rest on the bedside and I was like [ __ ] okay so they took me back to my parents house I don't remember a thing and then I'm like I need to go downstairs to exit the house and so I was I just remember I grabbed the ticket and I put on clothes and I walk down the stairs and I see my dad sitting on the couch with my stepmom and I was like okay like I'm ready he's just he's going to just rip into me and I sat down and I was just expecting him to just eviscerate my character and instead of eviscerating my character I remember he looked at me and he was like listen I'm not going to try and control you or tell you what to do or tell you that you need to change your life I just want to tell you I'm just I'm really worried because if you keep doing this I think you're just going to end up killing yourself and it was weird but in that moment when he said that it was like I think when you're young you feel Invincible right like you drink you feel like nothing will happen you drink and drive you feel like nothing will happen you do drugs you feel like nothing would happen and it was like in that moment I recognized that he was right and that I'm no different from all these other people who have gone on this path I could actually end up really hurting myself and I think the second to that was I felt so terrible that I made someone who loves me so much and has invested so much and only made my life better feel so shitty by who I was being and so you know I left and I was like I can't keep doing any of this you know like yeah being fat and working out all that but like I can't keep drinking like this I can't keep doing drugs like this this is not the life I want and and I remember like what I really thought about was when does it end you know like at eight arrests at 10 arrests at 300 PBS at 350 pounds you know what kind of drugs do you stop at and so I just really thought about that and I was like what is my life look like in three years and four years and five years if I keep doing this and that terrified me enough to immediately change literally everything and this is a process again that I just still haven't figured out how to quite explain but it's like the moment in that moment the fear of remaining the same was so much greater than any fear I had of change that I changed the next day like I threw out all my alcohol I decided I was moving out of the house I was in I lived with six people I said I'm not drinking I'm not doing drugs I'm going to work out I'm going to eat healthy me get a second job so I got a second job so I'm going to school I've got two jobs because I was like I can't I need to fill my time with something um you know I joined a gym and I started you know in my spare time reading watching YouTube videos that were you know self-development whatever I just said I can't be that person anymore and it was like I was so fed up with everything and in that moment the pain was so high that it made it fairly easy to change immediately because I understood finally that I was so uncomfortable as is and it's like I could remain uncomfortable in the situation I was in or I could be uncomfortable changing only one of those is productive right and only one of those turned my life into something I'm actually proud of and so those were the two moments that really caused me to change my life all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we called it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode have you ever heard of the Dickens method it's basically uh exactly what you just described if if you ever go to like a Tony Robbins event like his his big kind of events yeah um on one of the days he does this and it's basically the Dickens method is a it's a technique where you sort of vividly imagine you you time travel to the Future you're like okay let's play it forward a year let's play it forward five years I'm still doing it I'm keep doing it I do more of it in fact because I am increasing whatever the bad habit whatever the decisions whatever the whatever the thing I'm doing is and you play it forward and then how does that affect you how does that affect the people that you love and he sort of gets you to sort of go there and yeah you know like uh when I did it when I went to his event it was like um you know I wasn't really going through much at the time so it was I was like I don't know what this exercise for but around me there was literally people like screaming it was honestly very uncomfortable moment uh but people were really feeling something in that moment where if you play it forward and you vividly imagine what the future looks like five years later 10 years later 15 years later and how that affects all the people around you it creates this like emotional charge where it gives you again uh the pain of not changing increases over the pain of change and just like you described yeah which by the way I've talked about that in this part I I had I had a similar run rate I had about uh three arrests in three months really yeah I I also weighed 230 pounds uh and I was a a disgusting person and yeah love love booze and and substances and so it had a had a a similar issue of like after one arrest you're like what the [ __ ] Fu man what the [ __ ] I I didn't live with my parents at the time but I did I lived with my dog I had like this dog and I like he [ __ ] all over himself one day because I got arrested and I was in jail for 24 hours and I was like oh my God I'm letting him down it was like it's so funny it was like a very similar everything changed at that moment so you and I we are the same we had no idea yeah we are similar uh and what age were you when you moved to California what age were you when you met Alex yeah I was 20 almost 23 when I met him wait wait describe the first date well they they were buds first right weren't you guys buddies first we were buddies but we were dating I don't know how to describe this um there's a term for that yeah no but not not actually let I'll put it like this so like yeah that's not what I mean uh we met on Bumble and we went on our first date he asked me to go to froo he was like listen it's low commitment so if we're weird we can leave and I was like I mean good because I've been on some bad [ __ ] dates lately man um and so we meet at froo he comes up he's not very friendly I just remember the first thing he was like not smiling and I was like what's wrong with this guy uh we get in line and he's still not smiling and I'm like I'm like cracking a joke or two and I'm like this guy's tough uh come to find out later the reason he wasn't smiling is because I have a full back piece like my whole back is tattooed angel wings which is traumatic and embarrassing but uh it's because I got it when I was 18 and high and drunk um and so he saw that and was like oh man one of these girls and uh so apparently he was judging me the entire time for that that tattoo don't judge the book by its cover don't judge a Girl by her back all right that's that's the lesson it's too painful to get undone at this point um and so you know we ended up sitting down for froo and honestly you know once he had a few bites and I think got blood sugar in his system because if you know Alex you know his blood sugar is uh attached to how much food he's eating and so I think once he ate he was like hi and I was like oh okay okay you're a nice person let's go and uh we actually just started talking about business really picture this right like I had moved out there I was only focused on my career I didn't have friends I didn't have a boyfriend I had gone on dates but I did not find anybody I liked so I was really just me and my work and I was trying to figure out like what do I need to do next because I was doing online and in-person training and then I met him and he actually had the same story so he had moved out from Baltimore Maryland to pursue Fitness opened up a few gyms um and was trying to figure out what he was going to do next is his next step didn't really have a lot of friends and obviously didn't have a a girlfriend and so we didn't really have anything else to talk about and so we ended up actually like eating fryo and then we went on like a 4-Hour walk and we talked about work the entire time and I remember leaving the date because you know was Froyo was like 3 P.M he had a dinner at like 7 and so he actually asked me he's like will you come to the grocery store and get stuff for this dinner barbecue thing I have uh and I was like sure and we just talking the whole time still about business and once we got done I got in my car and I was like that was the weirdest date I've ever been on like it wasn't even like a date we didn't talk about anything romantic at all um we just literally talked about work but like all I know is I want to keep talking to that guy and I went back and I told my roommate I was like I'm just so interested like he's the first person I feel like I've had an intellectual conversation with since I've moved here you know because most of the time when I go out on dates with people it's like they had zero ambition they had no idea what they wanted to do with their lives and it was California so that's like a little bit more of the culture um they also just didn't really like the fact that I was as ambitious and working as much as I was and so to meet somebody who actually saw that as a pro had the same things in common and wanted to talk about them it was like the most enjoyable date I'd been on and then I think he called me the next day and was like hey do you want to like work together and I was like sure sounds fun so I went over to his house and I like brought all my stuff my laptop and everything we started working and that just like slowly kept happening over time and maybe yeah yeah uh and then one meeting a board meeting for sure we kissed in a meeting um so no I mean it was just like we had shared interest uh you know I didn't know when I met him that uh he was also Persian so then I found out oh we're both are both of our fathers are from Iran we had that in common um you know we had both moved out there on our own we just had a lot in common that I was just not expecting and because of that it just felt like for the first time in so long I had somebody who saw reality the same way I did and who didn't want to make me into somebody I wasn't you know like I've always every I can't even tell you how many times I've gone on dates guys and they're like you seem really great but you're kind of weird and like you're like a little obsessive and I was like yeah I know but that's I don't really want to change that about myself um or they didn't like that I worked as much as I did and I like working so I'm like I don't want to apologize for that and he was the first person I met that saw all those things as Pros that everyone else had seen as cons and not only that but you know I think I saw the same in him with a lot of things that people have complained about and so you know about a month in he's like I feel like you should not start this online thing or do this in person I was basically like do I open up my own gym or do I partner with this woman who wanted me to be her business partner online she already had a successful business and so you know four weeks then I said screw it like there's nothing to lose to go do this with him to start this business because I'm 23 like if [ __ ] doesn't work I'll just go back to what I was doing but I will regret if I don't take this chance to see if it could work and the thing that you're just talking about that's gym launch gym launch yeah and the first you know year and a half was literally just like he'd be at a gym I'd be at a gym different locations different um States and we'd be filling them up and then we'd call each other every night and be like here's what I'm doing here's what you're doing like just like best practices and that was like the first year of dating which was like I we're living out of Extended Stays we're in different states we're trying to launch these gyms you know I'm 23 walking into some dude's gym being like I'm gonna fill up your gym they're like what is going on right um and so you know the first year of our relationship was just like the eating [ __ ] phase of business but doing it together oh what do you mean by the eating [ __ ] phase of business you know it's just like when you start anything when you have no skills you're trying to accumulate all the skills at once you don't know what you're doing you have no Clarity and so you're just like throwing [ __ ] at a wall you're probably like not taking care of yourself the best you can because you're so focused on just trying to make this thing work because you're kind of just like in survival mode because you know at that point we have like no money as well right we've like pretty much burned through all the money then his business partner gets access to the bank account where we've been putting all the money from these gyms steals the money I mean it was just like thing after thing weren't you guys like living at your parents' home as well so we lived a few different places but then at one point we moved back to my parents house for two months at another point we actually lived with one of the clients of one of the gyms which was actually more fun dad like you know I thought I was disappointed before but now actually somehow this is worse yeah so yeah so you guys uh I wanted to ask you guys this so you've gym launch has this story like he Alex has come on the pot he's told the story about like how it you know went from like figuring it out to the business partner stealing the money and then he's it scales it if you want to listen to that there's an episode we did with him yeah but what's the like I've seen this now a couple times where sometimes you just get a business to work and you just crack a nut and it's scales in a way that sort of breaks your brain and you may never you may never even see that again so I think you guys did something like a year one or year two it went from like zero to like something like in the range of 15 million by year two something like 24 million I don't know if that's run rate or realized Revenue but realized Revenue realized Revenue that's an insane curve what's the summary of why that worked like that because that's not normal could I go do that same business today so for example if you started from scratch today if somebody if the next Alex and Lila were out there and they wanted to do gym launch today could they go and do the same model meaning is that problem still exist is the model still great where you're getting upfront cash from these gyms but for doing that you know kind of this quick turnaround service or is it saturated now and there's too much competition maybe the ad rates have changed right there's always these moments in time where businesses can succeed and then 10 years later you couldn't start that same business it's there's a new version of that business that those same people could go start could somebody as talented as you guys start gym launch again today and have the same level of success in your opinion no and why is that because the market has completely changed I mean think about Co that completely changed the nature of fitness ypc has changed Fitness I think that the future of Fitness looks completely different than Boutique gyms I think that you know I mean I know what they're doing in the background in the labs which is like people are going to be able to soon take a pill and they're going to be able to control their appetite why do you want to go to the gym every day if you could just be skinny lots of girls don't give a [ __ ] so what does the Future Fitness look like well I mean lifting weights is a great long-term way to sustain your body weight and to prevent you from getting fat but short term intervention food is always ideal right and that's going to have more of an effect on the shortterm like long-term muscle mass short-term food and so I think that what you're going to see is a lot more people just continuing to lean into what they always have as humans do which is uh short-term things that work which is eat less which you can do with pill um and they happen to have pills that are going to come out that are you know I think a lot of people um probably deter away from like OIC and stuff because it's a shot and it's like okay well the moment that they have a pill that can say I'm going to have I only need to have 25% of my normal appetite today well then think about the cost of the gym especially for females it's like you have to get up you've got to put on your outfit maybe some mascara you've got to look okay you have to drive there you have to go there you have to do things that feel hard and then you have to leave or I could just take a pill and not be hungry and not eat so I don't have to work out to worry about the food so I think that all those things have changed just a lot of companies in the fitness and health space General I can say that because we have other companies in the portfolio that are in that space and I also talk to a ton that are it has definitely changed the nature of that landscape you guys um you know Alex did something kind of interesting I think he said that like you bought him like a $50,000 consult with like Grant Cardone or something like that like right before the sale of gym launch where he published that which was like pretty wild where he was like here's how much cash we have we're thinking about selling and then I think there was even like a part two and a part three after the sale uh and so it was pretty cool to see that that was all public uh what did you guys and what three parts what did you do with the money once you uh sold like did you have a plan on where to invest it or did you just let let it sit there the second thing is did you have like a 10 20 year plan on where you wanted to go or is it like I don't know what we're going to do let's figure it out and then well answer those two first yeah yeah the idea with the money was we can put it you know in stocks in the short term we had some real estate deals we have one person we do real estate with specifically that we put some of the money in and then the rest of it was for acquisition. comom so it's like how do we get our first few deals we're going to use this as like the neste to invest in those deals part two to that is we knew we wanted a headquarters and so you know the headquarters was obviously I mean it's almost 40,000 square feet it's quite expensive so that was a big investment as well so most of the money has gone into the first few deals plus the headquarters the rest of the money we put in real estate deals that you know have done really well for us so and then I would say remainder you know stocks we have an oit fund and things like that too but um you know most of the times we want to be investing in how are we going to use the money to grow acquisition. comom faster that's really what we think about with the cast did you have the idea of that before you even sold gym launch the day after we sold we started acquisition. that's crazy yeah and what was the Genesis of that idea I'm sure many conversations but like do you remember kind of what the what would you call the origin really it actually started with what am I best in the world at what is Alex best in the world at right that's one piece the second piece to that is what is the ideal day today for Alex to sustain so that he knows that he's not going to want to quit because the work he's doing with the people he's doing it he doesn't like same for Lila right so it's like do things you like with people you like that's how you sustain performance in my opinion so then what does that look like for each of us and then what is a business that where there's room in the market that we can capitalize on both of our skills when we build and so you know Alex is you know he's constantly thinking of ideas he's like well what about this what I'm like no no no no what what were some of those ideas well I mean there was like we could go direct to Consumer for example you know we thought about you know the fact that he's so good at generating demand and I can build a big team that's really like well positioned for a director consumer business bus whether it be in beverages whether it be in food or whether it be in you know some kind of like Commerce um that was an idea um another idea that we had was um essentially like an actual like Health business so like building a platform for you know people who wanted to lose weight or get in shape using some kind of Technology integrating in AI um and then everything we know about how to actually help people um you know lose weight but then we saw you know as empit coming down line like [ __ ] that um and so those were two like strong Front Runners I would say and they were things that I could get passionate about um but then acquisition. comom was the one that I just kept coming back to because I was like you know the reason that I wanted to sell gym launch was I just asked myself do I want to be in the fitness industry for the next 10 years and the answer was no I was like I'm and I understand that I would probably get better Returns on my time staying in the fitness industry because I know it so well right we're already a market leader we know everything we've come up in this I've been doing it since I was however whatever age it's been over a decade now so has he we have a a competitive Advantage here but I was like I don't want to be in this the rest of my life and the reasons for it to be honest with you are just like the networking into the fitness industry felt less appealing to me than the networking in private equity for example and the people that I would be competing with and I think that who you compete with or who you compare yourself to right is like that sets the tone for who you wish to become in many ways like if I get in the room with whatever you can just say Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk or whatever and I have a company that I aspire to have like theirs like I'm going to compare myself to them uh versus when I met some of the people had some of the biggest Fitness businesses they were not though I could compare myself to them and yes they had done better by many measures they were not necessarily people I aspired to be like and so I just wanted to be in a different industry to get around different people and to acquire different skills that I didn't think I was going to get staying there and so when we looked at acquisition. I was really like what kind of person do I want to be and then what kind of business will allow me to become that person and then what kind of people do I need to have on my team to build that type of business and so I think a lot of it actually like circles back me and Alex were talking about this last night to like who do I want to be and the business is just a vehicle for personal growth in many ways and so for both of us I think that we are better entrepreneurs and better people for building acquisition. comom and I think that some people choose businesses that make them worse not better and this one is definitely one that I think helps maximize our skills but also gets us to be better people you know Alex has shared publicly many times like he was like when we first started acquisition. comom he kept saying like I really want to be more patient and you must be patient for this business to work and so because he wants the business to work more than anything right then he will learn to be more patient by as a as a byproduct of that and for me in order for acquisition. comom to work and not just work work but like really [ __ ] work like win and be number one I have to learn how to make content and be public facing and be a better Communicator overall and so it's not that every day I wake up excited to do that but it's that I want to win and I know that in order to win I have to learn these skills and so it forces me to learn those things in order to achieve my goals that's pretty badass I yeah that makes a ton of sense everything you said uh makes makes makes sense and is very aligned with how I I view life you I always say this it's a vehicle it's a it's a means to to have the type of life you want and become the type of person you want and then you then you just think okay if this is a vehicle who's getting in the who who do I want on this road trip with me and that's your co-founders your partners your investors who are the people I want in this car ride because we might get lost somewhere along the way and I really got to think that through and I think it's very important to have that mindset because I think people think the vehicle is the end itself and obviously it's not you see that because people do one vehicle and then they then they need the next they need the next and why do you keep why does Jeff Bezos need to go do his rocket company and why does he need to buy The Washington Post why do they need to do these things because that business the business itself was um was just a it's like a piece of workout equipment it's like going in and you see the bench press it's there to for me to get the workout for me to get the gains uh it's there to provide some resistance for me to get what I want out of life yeah I have a question for you about acquisition. so you guys you said you you've seen I don't know thousand businesses I was talking to you before we started recording about businesses that surprise you because they're just kind of Kick-Ass maybe it's a business that you maybe a category you hadn't heard of or just a business that people would Overlook or maybe would underrate but and you don't have to name the names of these businesses but I'd love for you to describe a kickass business that you've seen somewhere along the way at acquisition whether it's one you guys bought or not yeah I will say this um more businesses suck than you would think so what I learned in starting no seriously uh in starting acquisition. comom was just the amount of bad businesses there are what's the profile of bad and good or like what's like what's that threshold I I think product Market fit is not it's exists on a scale it's not yes or no but like poor like weak product Market fit weak Founders um low margin low potential you say weak but so much disgust I love it yeah I just need that clip I that's my alarm clock when I wake up I because it's like I'm like let me [ __ ] help you but like I can't if you're just [ __ ] weak so um it frustrates me because I'm like tough love but like this isn't going to work and so I would say like that has actually been more surprising than the good businesses that I've seen it's just the amount of businesses that I'm like wow it's it's shocking it's still here you know or it's like wow I can't believe this person actually started this thing um and so there's been a lot more of that I would say in terms of businesses that are really cool and you know I think have inspired me in in different ways it's people that are actually able to take something traditional and make it and innovate it you know it's like I always find those businesses really interesting like you know it could be anything like publishing books and turning That Into You know what instead of publishing books the way that we have been instead let's learn how to use AI to publish books and make the entire process automated that's a really cool business that I've seen play out I think that looking at uh school which people know that we publicly associate with like that business I have a lot of admiration for because of if you look at it by all like by all stats and metrics of that business it is mind-blowing and that they've been able to take this element of community that people only really feel in person and bring it online to such a degree that now people also are doing it offline and on like it's just it's been really cool to see the network effect uh through that business and then I would say like more traditional businesses like bakeries and how like traditional bakeries that make you know cookies or whatever have integrated tools like Ai and Technology to learn like okay what type of cookie profile is this person going to want to order and like just ways that people can integrate that kind of stuff like technology into like traditional businesses do bakeries that use AI is that is that a thing do does that does that make it better really I think that is all perception like I think value for a customer in many ways it is perceived right and so it's like if you feel like this cookie is customed to you because of this technology they have and they are able to like make it right there for you then I think yeah people will pay a lot more money for it that's for sure I mean I would but uh clearly because it works for them so I think those have been some of the cool business businesses what about this Workshop stuff so you guys start I started seeing ads for these workshops and I think you guys have probably done like I'm just doing some napkin math like something like $10 million of Workshop Revenue which is was a little bit surprising to me because I was like why are they doing this is like a lot of time the the math being supposedly or you maybe said this I think 1,800 people have gone through an acquisition. comom workshop and I think on your website it's $5,000 by the way I know a couple people who have gone and they said it was great so I'm not saying it in a bad way I guess what I'm saying is I was surprised you guys are doing that I was like oh no this is actually great um you know alignment right they like to teach it's dealflow at a like a proprietary level and then you know it's a win-win other people should get some value out of this they come in they get to focus on their business what I wanted to ask you about is what's the number one recurring problem you see because now you've seen 1,00 Founders come in and they're they paid a bunch of money to come to the workshop because they got a problem what's the common problem you see and what's the solve um that that you that you think would help most of these businesses the number one problem that I see is not Technical and it's not even a practical problem but more of an emotional problem which is I think Founders lie on one of two spectrums which is either they're incredibly impatient and because of that they never wait long enough to see if any kind of strategy will work they just change it and so it it doesn't even they don't even give it a shot to see if it'll play out because they change too soon and on the other side you have found Founders that are too tolerant and they basically just want to be liked at all costs and they don't make good decisions for their business because of that so I actually don't think that any of the problems that I see are technical problems is there a way to put like is there a way to put like a benchmark like for example are you talking about like you know you should for a lot of people they should be waiting a year to get to get results or you know or they react in weeks when they should be reacting in quarters is there a yeah I think a lot of people think that waiting a quarter is a long time and that's probably the issue uh they think oh well I waited three months and I'm like try waiting 18 you know I have things I'm doing acquisition. comom that you might ask about the workshops I'm like all right well if you see what's going to come out in the next four months which I've been working on for the last 12 months you'll see why it all makes sense right but a lot of people I think one don't have the ability to wait that long and two don't even know how to build something that takes that long your husband seems like a guy who is stereotypical of a person who does not have patience you know you said that he he he said I want to be more patient so I assume that means he didn't have patience uh has he been able to like go with the flow of like look we're going to we're we're planning 18 36 months out and that's what we're working on so you're not going to see because I know when I'm working at I'm like why don't I see results immediately we're investing all this money and all this time and we don't have [ __ ] results why aren't you out launching an MVP talking to potential customers don't tell me about you know what I mean like that's like how I feel and I think that's why I understand probably how he feels yeah I think something I've gotten a lot better at is showing him progress so because I this is what I realized which is just patience is just figuring out what to do in the meantime the reason I can be more patient is because I'm [ __ ] busy doing all the [ __ ] to make the thing happen right but if you're not the one in there having the meetings hiring the people recruiting the stuff putting the tech in place then it feels like it takes a long time and so because he sits more on the like demand gen side and doesn't have the whole team rolling into him he doesn't get that reinforcement on a daily basis of seeing that progress and so I look at myself as like my job is to tell him all all those things that are happening to show him look at all the [ __ ] that we're doing and where it's going to end up and how close we are and it might actually happen faster than we thought and so I think that a lot of the times people feel impatient because one they're not seeing progress because maybe they're removed from what's actually occurring I think that the second thing is you know I always look at it as for and for anybody if he's not you know in the daytoday operating making the plan happen then he's working on something for the future you know he's writing books he's making content he's you know often times when we have really big problems in the business maybe we'll have two or three at the same time it'll be like okay you know I know that these teams don't report to you but I'm over here solving this problem how about you solve this problem and then you know we're going to communicate about these things and so it's like I also think he can do special projects that's something that like you do in the meantime you know I think from a traditional standpoint I think what's really good about him in many ways is that he's impatient with things and so because of that I'll say this okay I think it's good to be patient it's also good to be impatient with things it just like which one and so I think what I love about his impatience at times is that he's able to isolate it to the way that people do things why does it take this long to do a video why does it take this long to talk to a customer why does it take this long to build an department and he questions things that other people just accept as fact because somebody else and some book said that's how you do business and I love that he questions those things and is impatient about how inefficient things in business can be I think that's fantastic Nal nval has the best quote on this he said impatient with actions patience with results so impatient on the inputs patient with the outputs is the the sort of Unstoppable formula 100% it's an advantage because I impatient with results I can also be too patient sometimes with the action and so I have learned from him I think we do a good job learning from each other I think that he's learned from my patience with results I've learned from his impatience with inputs or actions and that's benefited the business a lot we got to ask you we used to say we have seven female listeners and I think as the podcast has grown there's now tens out there and um I'm sure you get a lot of women who you look up to you who ask you for advice um so this is the you know here's the mic and if there's a female entrepreneur watching this what's your message to her you might think that because you're a female things are less fair or that people will treat you differently or that business is harder and there are things that you're going to have to overcome and while all those things might be true in certain circumstances and certain times and that some are irrefutably true the question to ask yourself is is this useful you know a lot of people come to me and they say isn't it hard to do business because like you know you're a woman and you're married to Alex like do people take you seriously I'm like I don't know is that a useful thought if it's not then why the [ __ ] would I focus on it and so I just completely um abolish any of this like female entrepreneur what's it like stuff and I've made one video about it because I wanted people to understand yes there are differences there are also advantages so like you can either focus on what sucks and what's worse or you can just focus on you know maximizing your strengths and taking advantage of the advantages and also just choosing to focus on [ __ ] that's useful you know what I mean like we can all point to reasons as to why people treat us differently we can also just like be better I'll tell you this which is like a joke between me and Alex is like so many people have tried to break us up um and like the key line is always like Leela you know he's he's suppressing you um because he's you know Alex I always just like have this internal dialogue which is like and that is why you will not win because you see people that are powerful as having an ability to suppress you you when I look at people who are powerful as what can I learn from them to be better so that when I'm in a room people would not say that about me they would not say oh you're being suppressed like what do I have to learn to be a person who is more powerful and I think that a lot of women throw around these terms and do these things but it's like you can either look at it as um as a disadvantage or or something to be an advantage to you you know I think that I've had to probably accumulate more skills that some men would not have to because I've had to learn to be better at things to be taken seriously in certain ways right or I've had to you know accumulate emotional skills that I wouldn't have to otherwise I think those are all pros and like if I have more challenge I also get the opportunity to acquire more skills so I just don't look at it like a bad thing and I look at it if anything like a good thing and I any thoughts that arise that are not useful I do not focus on ever you're the [ __ ] perfect answer you're you're you're you're fantastic you know you guys are um what an interesting couple you know typically like uh like my wife and I are are are fairly different in in a lot of different ways um but you guys are both uh very similar in your intensity but also in your way to like uh come up with like interesting ideas and interesting theories as to why the world is the way it is and how you're going to react to that uh most relationships I don't think are like that and so it's so it's so funny you guys are both like highly intense in in great ways um it's so fascinating my best I'm going to make that my new profile highly intense yeah we'll LinkedIn endorse you on that yeah my best compliment to you is to you guys is I think what's really admirable about your relationship is that I think you both have a very high desire to self-improve and um it takes me back to like one of my favorite quotes about relationships is uh you know I'll take care of me for you and you take care of you for me whereas I think most people approach relationships the opposite you're supposed to take care of me and I'm supposed to take care of you and you're never doing enough for me and I'm never doing enough for you and I think it is really great you guys are an A+ example of two people who say I'm going to self-improve in all the ways that I can and that's what makes me a great partner for you yeah and I think honestly I just wish for everyone that listens to this to take that to their business relationships and to their personal relationships because I think it applies to both all right well thanks for coming on I appreciate you thank you guys that's the episode [Music]

all right today we're talking to Ryan Peterson Ryan's an interesting guy cuz he started out working in a pizza shop bootstrapping his own company to millions of dollars and now he runs flexport which is a multi-billion dollar company so he's kind of done both sides the big Silicon Valley game as well as the bootstrap Mak something out of nothing form of Entrepreneurship and we talk about three things the one big lesson he learned when he became friends with Charlie Munger what Charlie merer really taught him number two is a master class in negotiation so things that he learned about negotiation back when he was in business school that still help him today and the Paradox of wealth so why chasing money why money is great and you want to make money and he says money is great too but how instead of chasing money directly you should do something else instead he calls this the Paradox of wealth so enjoy this episode with Ryan [Music] Peterson okay today you have the Silicon Valley success story so you've got flexport this like Behemoth of a company multibillion company went through YC you did the Silicon Val you won the Silicon Valley game which is great and I live in Silicon Valley I like you know I'm I spent 10 years trying to win that game the other side of it though that's I think a lot more relatable is you were you know working at Domino's Pizza as a team you flipped scooters from you know on eBay you then built import genius which is a bootstrap company that I think had kind of like real iida like I think you were making millions in IA along the way right still am still am it's still a good business exactly so you've done both right you've done the bootstrapper game you've done the The Flipper game and then now you've done the the big you know Silicon Valley disruptive disruptive game and so I think that's cool that you did them and not just that you did all those things but one sort of led to the other is that right like the scooters led to ort genius which led to ultimately flexport yeah I think that definitely drawing the lines backwards you can make that pattern really easily that um really the scooters I was working for my older brother and and his business partner Michael K and we had a lot of frustration with Freight forwarders and Customs Brokers and we had a lot of frustration with finding good factories those were kind of the two big problems that we saw I have this Ecom business that um has over I started it kind of right before or right during Co basically we launched right after covid and we've now done over I don't know 50 million in Revenue but I would not have found my factory had I not used import genius and I I remember I was like I'm kind of like a shortcut taker in general so I was like okay I either I can go on Alibaba and I could try every single supplier on here try to find a good one or I could go to whoever I think has the best quality and just try to reverse engineer who is their Factory who is their supplier and uh actually I remember like buying the $99 or $199 I don't remember what it was like import genius subscription and then actually there was somebody on your chat team that did the search for me because it wasn't showing up initially and they went back like further in the records 12 months 15 months ago and they found one manifest and so people don't know how this works what you guys did was basically you took public data about the shipping manifest and then you organized and structured it so you could see for any business who's their supplier and for any supplier who are all the businesses they work with is that right is that the right way describing it yeah that's what import genius does it's still it's still we haven't raised prices much either it's still about the same as you said 99 or 199 we might raise it a tiny bit but um import genius.com is the business that I started and you know if only you mentioned Alibaba because that's I started that business out of frustration I was living in China for a while and I would use Alibaba to find a factory I would show up at the factory and they weren't expecting people to just show up and it would be like fake Factory like it's just a middleman like you know or like one time they I did give him a couple Advanced names but I showed up and they were like very clearly like faking it like this was not bunch of guys in a warehouse with no equipment or anything so yeah it was frustration for that I think it been for genius kind of like the organic search results like Google you know if it was all AdWords you that's kind of like what Alibaba is like people paying for pric ETC um alibaba.com is of course the original business was B2B searching for factories but that that's not what drives their market cap their market cap is driven by Tau and alipe and all these other products right um but yeah the original business is like finding factories I think import is a much better way to do that I do think that my brand is around seeing problems that somehow other people just kind of take for granted and they're blind to in some way that they just sort of accepted as that's just reality and then actually getting really curious about it and looking at what could you do to solve it and that's where in4 genius came from that's where fxb came from and that's sort of that same problem it's annoying I'm kind of annoying that way like when I go to a restaurant I'm like doing bottleneck analysis on the cashier like what would I do to like you know get this get the traffic flowing faster through this place but um yeah I can't help it what what is Paul grams word for this schle schle blindness right blindness yeah I usually Point people to that essay on on Paul Graham's essays called schle blindness which is this idea that you're kind of blind to the biggest problems in the world Paul has a good quote about you I found in my research this is a this is the make you blush section all right so it says Paul Graham founder of why combinator says Ryan is what I call an armor-piercing shell a Founder who keeps going through obstacles that would make other people give up a do you think it's true and B why do you think Paul thinks that about you I don't know if it's true we work we I do work really hard and don't give up easily um Paul and I have had a great relationship for a long time he's seen me since the very early days I met Paul when I was before I even I had started flag sport but barely my brother did y combinator the year before me we were renting a house actually it used to be Max lean's house because we used to get his mail I don't know how long before it must have been a long time before because it wasn't a very nice it was like a little apartment pre house I was like before you got rich but uh we were renting this apartment and it was near a dog it was there a park where Paul would take his kid George who's now older when he was and we would uh we would take my dog there to play so we' just like run into Paul and my brother was in YC at the time so we got this striking up conversation so Paul seen me since like flexport was just an idea basically he's been a great adviser for us said nice things to a lot of people what uh what did Paul help you with because I've asked people this a couple times and I feel like everybody's got a great Paul Graham story of like there was a you know these there's these like Crucible moments in every startup or there's these moments of uncertainty and Paul either brings either a certain level of confidence or Clarity or a question or a bit of advice that was was helpful early on do you do you feel like there was one of those for you I think Paul's got his superpower is like not he only sees what's possible and like how valuable or big could this thing be if everything works and he ignores every other outcome that's possible and that is probably the right way to do seed investing you know in the power law world to find like the and so he always saw if flexport really worked the outcome is so outsized and enormous given the industry size and and importance then and and then he could help us sell that story to other investors to candidates he would send emails early days to like top Engineers saying really great things about us quotes like the one you mentioned to different press and stuff like that he's also been a really big supporter of flexport dorg which is our um humanitarian relief Logistics Division that that helps nonprofits doing refugee camp Logistics or other sorts of Disaster Recovery Logistics he's been he's donated millions of dollars to US there and helped us get the word out about all that stuff so he's huge supporter of flexport that's amazing yeah I always think about like the the first believer I think everybody has this person who uh believes in you more than you believe in yourself for a period of time and it's sort of like a it's like a short loan it's like a short-term loan that you can get of of conviction and um is very helpful to an entrepreneur and it's actually very helpful to be that person especially once you have a little bit of success as an entrepreneur you now can lend a little bit of conviction to other people you believe in when they when they don't really have it yeah I mean Paul's job is hard well he's he's retired now but the job of being a YC partner or leader of YC is just super hard just L A Lot most of those people are going to fail so you have to kind of dele delude yourself uh if you really want to say only focus on what could happen well it's probably not what's going to happen in most of the cases but uh that's very hard psychologically I'm sure yeah maybe he needs another essay that's like schle blindness but it's on the investor side it's like you know fail fail blindness it's like the ability to easily forget all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we call it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode with import genius you took publicly available data you structured it you made it into a useful business that generates millions of dollars a year profit seems like your brother also did that same business model right in a different space with build Zoom can you explain maybe what is the underlying you know way framework of how to think about business ideas like that that might that might succeed because it seems like there's a pattern that there's multiple ideas like that that yeah build zom was born out of the frustration of finding a contractor Bill Jim is my older brother David's company one of his companies and he was my co-founder with import genius and and my boss for a while and you I was sort of My Mentor in startup world uh buil in with for out of the frustration of finding a contractor to work on your house and underlying it is this public data set of building permits are largely public record but hard to access and we had a lot of experience of doing that with import genius so I built the search engine on building permits and let you you look up any wherever you are any house you can see who the contractors were that built on that that worked on it which is pretty useful as a homeowner by the way as a tool see who who built the problem if you have a problem go find that person they probably can help you with it um but also you're doing do diligence on contractors know you know be able to talk to the actual homeowners who worked like who worked with them making sure that the reviews are actually for people that hire this contractor like there's a great data set out there so they built they built a nice little business on top of that data set I think that government data is a big opportunity the government has tons of public records on all kinds of stuff and no real incentive to organize it in ways that are particularly useful it it makes it hard to build defensibility onto these businesses because other people can if it's public record other people can access the data too um so you have to get distribution or build some kind of a network effect on top of it like in build zoom's case it's like reviews that you're layering on to this and and sort of brand is always the ultimate Network effect that you can build on to it but you know I think people overthink def defensibility a little bit like how could you have defensibility you're a startup just like you know if it was defens how could you possibly do it yourself uh yeah we we did an episode recently on the U I was like I found this app that's called Oasis it's a water water quality tracking app so basically like how much how much you know forever chemicals are in your water oh yeah this it's this kid it's this kid who did the same thing he basically was like he lived in I think Minnesota where they had like clean water he drank tap all the time he moved to LA started drinking tap water it tasted funny he got a little bit sick he's like oh man I wish I could figure this out turns out every city has their own testing data that's publicly available turns out that you can request from every bottled water company their reports as well so then he created this app that basically present it to the consumer and then he goes viral on Tik Tok with these like kind of like fear-based like did you know that blah blah blah but you can check this using this app and he's built a you know a thriving business on this thing I think he's at like 50k Mr and he's just a kid in his 20s nice it's not the most defensible thing get this to RFK Jr man he'll be that's right but I think it's kind of amazing that you could do this taking public data and make making that happen yeah brand and Network distribution getting users getting people loyal to it execute High Velocity yeah I got I remember I got in a fight on Twitter like five years ago with some guy U talking about Moes and I I was just making a play on word saying well you know the moat turned out to be not that useful once someone invented artillery right actual Moes like we don't use otes like when you gon to put alligators to defend your business so I was talk like actually you know you don't really want to hide behind some walls like the real ever ever since the blitz C in like 1940 1939 whatever we learned that like High Velocity attack is the way to win not like sitting behind defensive walls right and I don't know some investor like got really upset with me that I didn't believe in Moes uh of course you know I'm just making a play on words but right well you you wrote in here something that found pretty interesting I didn't know you were friends with Charlie Munger and speaking of Moes Buffett Munger famously talked about how defensibility and Moes are super important can you tell the story how did you become friends with Charlie moner yeah rip um what oh I know friendly with Charlie M would say uh I I had dinner at his house seven or eight times um before he passed I went to his 99th birthday party last year actually I I'm a huge fan of he has this essay which I think every young for every person should read especially young people trying to figure their way through the world called um it's called The Art of worldly wisdom yeah definitely if you go go worldly wisdom Charlie Munger you'll find it I actually found it on Paul gr's website I believe PG published it to the why commentator website at some point and I had read it when I was young and feeling uninspired or like trying to figure things out what should I do with my life and the the essay basically argues that there's in every discipline like biology or chemistry or whatever the dis there's you know you can Define number of disciplines however you want sort of but somewhat arbitrary but just say there's few hundred disciplines in the world and that in each one there's two there's two or three big ideas that carry 80% of the freight that if you know those two or three big Ideas you kind of will get 80% of that whole discipline like in biology it's probably like Darwin you know darwinian Evolution and something to do with genetics which are obviously related but like you can get those two or three Pig ideas you'll have enough biology to be dangerous right and that you can learn these ideas by going to read the textbook and so if there's only 300 disciplines and three two or three ideas you're like okay I've got to do about 600 to a thousand ideas that if I could learn them I'd be like what Munger calls worldly wise it's an interesting conab that set me off on a journey of i' probably read hundreds of books as a result of that and so search searching for the Big Ideas in every space yeah I'm like what are these disciplines and like disciplines I don't really that I found boring well like okay whatever I'll just go find still learn the top ideas from it um no I'm not saying I've succeeded there's some disciplines I can't bring myself to and by the way his essay isn't just saying there are these ideas he actually lists a bunch of them so he's like for example things gravitate towards win or take all therefore it pays to be number one or number two or just be out and then he gives example right so he'll give he the essay isn't just the concept that these ideas exist he gives a bunch of examples in it yeah and you know you call them like mental models you build these mental models from one discipline it turns out they're often applicable in another and that's where a lot of the good ideas can come from um and a lot a lot of innovation comes from applying an idea Like Richard Fan's a great example of this famous physicist he spent like two years as a biologist and like had did some groundbreaking work in biology just because he took ideas from physics that people hadn't really thought of Frameworks and applied it in biology right anyways I I was very inspired by Munger for many you know decades really still am and and I was at a party at one of my investors houses and I was just talking to this older guy neither of us knew anybody at this party or didn't know many people and I he asked me what my favorite book is and I started talking about poor Charlie's Almanac which is a great book uh that stripe just repr reprinted by the way I I told him that book is my favorite and it started telling him why and I told the story of the you know worldly wisdom and how I was living in China I was bored out of my mind sometimes and so I bought all these books and just started reading books like hours a day every day um and he let me talk for a long time before he's like yeah I know that book really well I wrote that book it turned out the guy was talking to is a guy named Peter Kaufman who wrote the book poor Charlie's Almanac he's like one of Charlie munger's best friends and he just thought got such a kick out of me telling him so much about how great his book was that he brought me to Charlie's house for dinner and many went many times became friends with a few other of Charlie's friends and got involved you know invited to lots of dinners and Charlie I remember when I first told him about what flag sport does he was like oh this is that's great you have a great business because the key to success is dumb competition and he started ranting about like all of his experience working with freight companies and I I I I also think that's a great little tagline too is like remember you know when you're trying to think of what business to do all these guys doing AI startups like make I think applying AI to some old school Frozen industry a great idea but just going straight head in head on against other AI Geniuses is like a recipe like who wants to compete with people that's more like you rather compete with Knuckleheads wherever you can yeah exactly that's a very uh simple principle like in poker table selection is like probably the most important decision you make so everyone thinks poker's about like you know the the Bluffs and the advanced betting strategies or whatever it is and a huge amount of your success comes down to which table did you choose to sit down at if you chose to sit down at the fish table you're going to do pretty well and that one decision was the most important decision you could have made if you sit down with all the sharks well good luck doesn't matter how good you are you're probably just going to you know bash your head against the wall for a while that's why I don't play poker when you met this guy I I like how you said you were at a party and you're like we both didn't know anybody there's just like Alliance of the outcasts that happens I don't know if you you've heard the story about Ben and Jerry's but they they asked Ben Ben how'd you meet Jerry and he goes well they go were you guys friends immediately because they've been friends for a long time he go goes no he goes we we just were in the same PE class and they had we had to run the mile and both of us hated running so we were the only two guys walking and eventually if you're just walking at the back with one other guy eventually you'll start talking and he's like that was the foundation of Ben and Jerry's also I want to ask you about this you said you moved to China what was the thought process that got you there and then what' you get out of doing that um it was 205 it was clearly booming it seemed like the future we were at that time I was working for my brother we had this scooter company buying dirt bikes and road we say scooters but off-road vehicles doing buggies all kinds of cool Motorsports products uh and we were buying everything from China but not like they were buying everything off the internet no one had they had been to China right and during college I lived in South America I lived in Chile and Brazil and I learned I speak Spanish and Portuguese so I was like I can if anyone could learn Chinese I could probably learn Chinese like learn these other two languages which was very naive um so I saved up a little money and just like move there did you plan to be there for a while did you buy one we ticket what was the what' you tell yourself going in I I don't know I didn't have an exit plan I was um just going to learn Chinese and and learn about Chinese culture and history and economics and what's going on in the boom what what's your tip if somebody's in their 20s and they're they're kind of int intrigued by this like the adventure path what would you tell them like how would you tell them to think about this now that you've done it well I I think it's really about your values you know and really introspecting you can select your values too well a lot of people just kind of go through life without thinking about this I I did and my value without knowing it consciously my number one value in life until I was about 25 or 26 was adventure and I just wanted to like try all kinds of go all over the world and remember this was pre- iPhone so it was like pretty adventurous like I didn't have GPS in my pocket or translation apps or I mean I just had to like figure stuff out out walking around asking people for directions and hoping they'd be nice to me which they were but it was definitely an adventure i i i and so at that time that was my value was like chasing Adventure that's not for everybody but if it is like it's pretty easy to achieve going to cheap places it's a lot less adventurous these days I mean you show up you call now you go to China you call Uber or DD or DD I guess and uh you got Google trans you got Maps you got translation apps it's like it's a little too easy um I I once Rod my bicycle from China to Vietnam and no map the map we had was all wrong which is worse than no map almost and we just had to figure it out and we slept at people's houses at certain times like it was like yeah old school Adventures I I think back to my question about why Paul Graham called you you know an armor-piercing shell who just F you know figures things out I think I think this is where you get the Reps in right like it doesn't start the problem solving and confidence that I'm I'm going to figure things out doesn't just start the day you incorporate your you know your startup in Delaware it starts by getting a bunch of reps uh earlier in life maybe I think learning a foreign language in that country is extremely it's not a good Roi from like you probably won't make any money off of this especially now with chat GPT it's incredible how I can do live translation into every app into every language I mean um but like the humility of like PE everyone thought I was a freaking idiot I mean I was like I couldn't speak um and like you know bus drivers think I'm an idiot uh and having that over and over and over again every day is pretty good for your ego and your humility and also for relating to other people like in your country and when you went there so you're like I'm going to go I'm going to learn the language I'm going to travel eat um but you're a business junkie like you said something I saw in the research which was like you know I was like oh this guy's my kind of people you go my form of entertainment is making a landing page one night and sending some traffic and seeing if people click to buy right so did you were you kind of scheming and dreaming about business while you were there what what were you doing on the business side while you yeah so we were we were sourcing all of our products from China and so I was like I would going to factories buy like evaluate quality men shipments do I would I would do a l everything make websites do marketing customer service um was that was that scooter business any good did you make any money doing that or what was the result it was pretty good for like yeah you know you made salary like Sal like W2 level income that was above all my all of our friends at the time but not like change your life kind of income right you know this podcast the title of it is called my first million and one of the things I at the beginning the premise of the podcast was always going to be let me bring people on and ask them how they made their first million and that's that's where it started ended up pivoting to something else and kept the name because when something gets popular change the name is a little risky but I still do like the question of like when you when you did make your first million what changed because I view money as a tool to improve the quality of your life and I think it's very easy to slip into money is this kind of measuring stick or just think this thing you accumulate over time and so I'm curious for you once you kind of had a win probably during the import genius days where okay you've made some like real money that you frees up your time how'd you use it and how did it feel and what you what was your mindset you know during that time can you share anything like that because I think that's where a lot of people want to get to or they they're just at who listen to this and I think that would be pretty relatable for first thing I did when I started making money was paying up all my student debt okay uh that that that felt great I invested it wisely put a lot in the wealth front Index Fund investing bought a couple of like real estate cash generating real estate properties I made some stupid decisions too I once invented invested in a nightclub that failed that was stupid but uh it didn't change much well first off people would tell you that money's not important or won't I I don't believe these studies that say like oh like you know you stop at 75 stop improving your life at a certain point I'm certain that that can't be replicated you know most most of these psychology studies turn out to be not there's a replication crisis in Psychology and I'm certain that that's one um and and like you know that money is great because the more people have the more they want it must be great right must be amazing enough of it um wait could you say more about this Paradox of wealth because I saw you write down this idea I want to read you a line from this and and just kind of hear hear you talk about this so you here's what you wrote you wrote Paradox of wealth focusing on making money will cause you to make less money nobody wants to give money to people who are too focused on money they perceive them as greedy and self-interested try to avoid them they give money to people who add value for them it is fine to want money it's great in fact money is one of the best things in the world but it's a paradox the more of it you want the less of it you get so hack your brain into instead focusing on the things that are Upstream of making money what's Upstream of making money yeah I think Upstream making money is solving problems for people at the end of the day which means learning you to go build your skill set up so you can learn Upstream of that is learning what the problems are and and they developing a set of skills and capabilities to let you solve them salespeople can suffer from this or they can be great like great sales people are really consultative like good at asking questions good at diagnosing problems understand what their product or their firm can do to solve that problem and you know you bring those together you win everybody wins creating win-wins but but the perception of a salesperson is a pusher that uh I'm gonna make you I'm gonna try to get you to buy something you don't want or there's a lot of bad sales people that AR a bad sales person yeah toally but that's the image that most people have when they think of sales people and and you know this is true because we can't even call people A salesperson count executive sales is such a bad word yeah we had to Rebrand it we had to go aoli instead of mayo there's only a couple of this may have changed I think it did in fact a few years ago when I looked into it there were only three universities in the United States that offered a major in sales wow you like it's part of everybody's job it's like probably 10% of all the jobs in the whole world are sales explicitly and then everybody has to sell their ideas um and we've yeah kind of been wrongly scapegoated as though this was like a terrible profession when in fact they're the key driver of every company even Tech so many good tech companies fail with good technology because they can't ever learn how to sell it get customers and then there's companies with where the tech is just they don't even have Tech and they're just good at selling so right yeah I think hacking the brain I used to say things are correlated with money but I think it's better to go upstream and actually causing right the generation of wealth uh and the more you can study that um then you'll get lots of wealth and I I don't think it's bad to want money but you just have to realize like it it might cause you to get less it's a bit Like Love by the way someone's obsessed with finding like a girlfriend or husband or something like it get kind of creepy like you know work on yourself instead yeah that's a great one there's a great story about Buffett I don't know if you heard this one where he goes to a classroom and there's a bunch of kids sitting there and he says all right let's play a game and he basically saysi want you to point to one person in this classroom you could choose any classmate not yourself but somebody else and you get to get 10% of their earnings for the rest of their life write down on a piece of paper the name of the person you're picking and why and so uh have you heard the story before I don't want to yeah but maybe it's Not Gon to surprise you but like it's it's interesting the first I think it makes the point well so he everybody writes down the name and then he brings it up he's like you know okay who here just raise your hand did you pick the person with the best grades and nobody raises their hands so already that tells you something right about school and what we think is the valuable thing versus what everybody intuitively in their gut knew is the valuable thing he says okay did you just pick the person with the highest IQ and a couple people rais their hands did you pick the guy who could throw the football the farthest nobody raises their hand um and so then he finds starts asking he like what qualities did you pick and basically that's where you know it came down to some version of the following characteristics that Buffett ultimately used for for picking people which is you know he talks about like energy so it it was people who are really they're really obsessed with things really into things when they get when they put their mind to a project they just never stop they just never give up they just kind of have an endless energy towards something another one was like Integrity right because if this person is g to act out of bounds then you know owning 10% of their future if they're in jail is not going to do me much good I got to have somebody who's going to play by the rules and play by the law they know what rules to break and what rules not to break and then the last one was Intelligence which somebody who's good at figuring things out specifically so not your grades or just your Ro IQ but somebody who tends to figure things out and um he's like great so now you have the formula of what you need to be right like if that's what you would pick in others that's what you need to be and there's that sort of reminds me of the the Paradox of wealth which is like if you put a 100 people together you're like all right who's going to be the wealthiest I think intuitively we would know it's not the person who's going to just like sort of only chase money and try to just extract as much money as they could out of something system it's probably not going to work as well as somebody who does the things you talked about speak of school I took a negotiations class once and it was one of my favorite classes um everyone should try to get into one of these things because the way way work I've always wanted to take this I kind of want to go to business school but I'd love to take a negotiation class they're G you're given like a case study where both parties read this document you have slightly different rules to play and then you negotiate with each other under those conditions but what's what's amazing is that in a class there's 30 other pairs if there's 60 people in your class there's 30 other pairs or 15 whatever however many people um doing the exact same thing so you can compare yourself how you did against other people in the same seat as you and that was over almost 20 years ago and it's very interesting because I've stayed in touch with a lot of these people and you can track the people who were the best negotiators in a classroom environment or not the most successful because they're very good at extracting too much in a one-off negotiation but that's not how life works right in life there's repeat games like you gotta let the other guy win you gotta you know if you just took advantage of someone like they're never gonna want to do business with you again guess what like you're not GNA do that well so it's kind of an interesting a like like long longitudinal study that someone could do on these things I worked with my dad for about nine months and working with your dad's an interesting experience in a bunch of different ways but one of the things you actually get to see your dad in a new context I got to see my dad at work and one of the things that I asked other people at work I go what's my dad good at what's his strength and they all said um you know he's a good negot neor he's a great negotiator but he's a little too tough and I okay interesting that's because I asked strength and weakness and they kind of said the same thing so I got into the situation where it was one like high stakes negotiation basically like the future of the company was like kind of up for grabs and somebody had leverage somebody else had leverage we all sat down to this table and my dad did one thing really great which was he was like we didn't really like the options on the table and he's like oh okay cool I'll always go with the third option then no I was like no what what like what's your counter he's like no counter no and he's you know he's like basically in a negotiation he's like um I was like well how are you going to you know explain this he's like oh it's not about explaining in a negotiation the more irrational person tends to win the more stubborn party wins because the other person will just realize this person's irrational so I just have to play by their rules so he was super stubborn and he won and at the end they took a break they kind of like okay let's go break before we kind of come back and finalize and I asked this other guy who was kind of the arbitrator sitting there I said uh what do you think and he goes I think you took too much and my dad kind of smiled he took that as a point of Pride and I sort of was like well what do you mean by that he's like he's like you you were at a poker table and you tilted the table and all the chips went towards you there's no way this deal gets done eventually gets done right because they have nothing to gain you you've taken everything away from them so they have nothing to gain out of this transaction today they feel forced but soon they'll just realize ah this is not even I don't have to do that I I'd rather not and that's exactly how it played out and I you know I learned a lesson sort of at my dad expense about in a negotiation you you sort of both sides need to leave a little wanting or even if you take too much you see need sort of need to give back at the end um in order for something to be sustainable or especially if you're playing a repeat game where have you had you know negotiation in in in your life since then right because is not a not a not an everyday thing it's a it's a once in a while thing oh man we run a global logistics company where we're we have to procure ocean Freight and Air Freight and then we have to sell Air Freight and ocean Freight talking custom Services everything else that we do on the endtoend basis so there's a huge amount of negotiation I think one of the big opportunities we have in this industry is I think the industry is very shortterm focused and transactional almost mercenary and some of these things you have to kind of go with the industry you can't change everything about the industry at once but being able to play the long game and say hey we're gonna wait we're going to make tons of money by building trust with people and showing them where the profit pools are and not not taking too much of it and figuring out how to we um create the right win-win scenario and not I it's a good framework actually for evaluating any company is kind of there's six stakeholders at the table for every company you have your customers you have your vendors which in some cases don't matter that much but for us they matter a lot you've got your employees your investors you have regulators and you have like the communities where you live and operate and so you've got these six stakeholders and you got to create a win-win and it's a very simple way for each of them they need to win in an ideal scenario and you can go through almost any any company and say okay let's score them a through F on for each one of those things very rare to find a company where every single party is winning right um somebody's usually you know like so so what's the goal is it mostly a is and but nothing below a c what's but but where you have something that's bad like you've got a lot of risk and that's no good right it could all come to a stop like if especially if that like The Regulators are not happy communities are like I don't know protesting you trying to run you out of town like I think like Airbnb is a good example I think there's a great company guests pretty much love it the the um homeowners definitely love it they're making free cash off this unused asset Investor's done really great uh the employees seem really happy over there The Regulators they not thrilled in some cases they did manage it sometimes they like it because it generates tax Remnant communities I don't know I don't want people throwing a party in the house next door to mine and so that's an area for them as they have this framework okay where should we emphasiz what are we doing and they have they they look at this I don't know they use that exact framework but they certainly are going okay let's ban partying what else can we do to make neighbors like us more right like uh and so it's a it's a pretty simple framework I think someone's looking for a job at a company they should definitely take take the time to score each company they're considering on this framework or investors the same way because it it you know if everybody's not winning then the thing might not be sustainable for the long term and all the good returns as an investor come by holding for a very long time and letting the the the compounding machine ride yeah the risk accumulates uh it may not be a problem right now but it's it's accumulating eventually that's a pwder Kake you are also a partner at Founders fund right yeah a venture partner Adventure partner at Founders fund uh your LinkedIn says looking for a generational company to back um how's that going great I mean I Founders fund I've been very loyal part of the founders fund Network for a while they they were our first series a investor they L our a and our B and participated I think in the every other round that we've done basically and uh when they asked me to join it was kind of Nob brainer for me I mean it what took me a little while I said no a bunch of times so I shouldn't say Nob brainer but the only fun that we consider joining because I think really unique in their refusal to follow the herd um and to think for themselves but uh I I joined actually full-time as a general partner and then I came back to flexport I I took about six months where I was the uh chair executive chairman and uh then I realized I had to come back and be the CEO again at Flex work and so I kind of scaled my rollway back at fish one but I'm still part of the team you said like you know they're unique in how they do things I've I've interacted with them a bunch to and felt that but I'm always interested like what's the cause of that effect so like what what is the example of something that they do differently on the input side that leads to the output of being uh you know sort of independent thinkers or contrarian or willing to make bets that others don't well a lot of it it just comes from Peter being refusing like he's just like that's his whole life thesis is that people are mimic and they will chase the same outcome the same goal the same object the same mimetic desire everybody wants the same same thing and if you can avoid that there's a huge Arbitrage opportunity if you can go look where other people are looking and so a lot of it just comes I would say probably just from Peter but they've they've really trained it into the team how does that manifest itself it's a very high-paying job Founders one actually has a better compensation structure it's almost all tied to the outcomes the performance but like a lot of VCS just make super huge you'd be surprised how high the salaries are at a lot of at other VCS um so they make a lot of money in a job that can't really be measured except on a 10year Time Horizon and even on that it could be luck and so and and you don't have like an overseeing like a boss breathing down your neck like you can do it from anywhere kind of nobody's every time I email a VC they seem to be in France so it's it's a it's a job that like is kind of a dream where you just so what's the incentive structure there for like just don't get fired and it's hard to fire you for performance because it takes a long time for these things to mature and again it could be luck so the way you get fired is by everybody consensus agreeing that you're doing dumb things it's not by doing dumb things it's by having a consensus form around you that this guy's making dumb decisions we got to fire them and there a lot of cases where funs fired someone who it turned out a few years later had like been their best guy but they didn't know it so therefore the way to avoid getting fired in VC again this is not Founders F this what I like about them that they're very different but is the way to avoid getting fired is to be well to double check everything you do with other VCS right to make sure everybody agree and you don't want to do it internally because then you look like you got no opinions then you can't operate so you do it with all your buddies and all the other VCS so it's just a collusion massive collusion racket on per like there's no the incentives are just structured s that everybody's talking to everybody to double check and make sure and then that leads to regression herd mentality regression of the mean it leads to people not wanting to take a lot of risk which is just a lame is is just lame right like Venture Capital should be all about risk taking but it's not often it's not and I think Founders F's very good at not participating in those things they don't really go to conferences the conference they do do it's called hereticon it's like literally about heretical ideas that you're not allowed to say out loud that's probably the most unique conference most people probably don't know what it is can you explain what hereticon is and then maybe some examples of what a talk at hereticon might be about it's Heron his idea most conferences people on stage are like you can't say anything that's not sitting the mainstream narrative right and hereticon the idea is that you come up into the stage and say something that would like get you cancelled or some heretical idea the definition I hav't been they don't publish the talks online I don't think because of the nature of it all but I I'm working on I'm going to do a talk if if I can make maybe next year I'll try to do a talk as the definition of heretic a person holding opinion at odds with what is generally accepted I texted a bunch of friends who went I said hey what was the best thing and they were like well like you know someone gave this I like my belief in the probability that aliens exist has like has like actually meaningfully changed based on X talk or this person gave this talk about you know the conspiracy around XYZ and U it just sounds fast sounds like you know one of the few conferences where I I would get there early and stay late which is like the like H brand right like don't don't just follow the herd and they're not trying to like just reference check every deals they'll put their neck out there make some crazy bets what's amazing and I didn't haven't yet figured out is how they have such an amazing track record because I don't think just yoloing it in the they're very good at picking Founders I think um right there's no formula for it because people are unique but it's it it is a really interesting and they're writing they're very big fun these days and they write large checks with conviction but without being like spreadsheet monkeys who are just you know it's not all of course they do due diligence and Analysis and stuff but there's a they're much more built on who the founder is and what they're all about right before you came on I asked in the I sent this like Doc to every guest and I one of the questions I asked is like what are three strong opinions or life philosophies you live by so one is related to what we're talking about you had this quote from says the great man is he who in the midst of the crowd keeps with perfect sweetness the independence of solitude and you had some examples under this can you talk about that what that means to you and what are some examples well there's some great very practical examples that you can use in your life and you'll be able to see that this is true and literally related to crowds and next time you are entering a stadium watch your brain will want to just follow the people mindlessly into the stadium but if you were able to snap out of that and go wait let me think for right now these people have no idea most of them have never been to this stadium before they don't know where the entrance is there's always another entrance that nobody's lined up for and you can just walk right in always like or a parking I'm a big skier whenever you go to the ski resort there are these guys that are like waving parking attendant and their their job is to park all the cars but their job is not to park your car as close to the mountain as you could be like they're not like there's not a thousand spaces right next to the chairlift so they're going to point everybody to where there's CH spaces which like for sure you're going to have to take some kind of shuttle right it'll take you an hour to get to the ski lift but if you just ignore that guy I mean I don't want to be rude and figure out a way to do this it's not like breaking the rules or whatever but go straight to the front and there will be a spot right next to the Cher lift because somebody leaves somebody's always leaving and and so yeah you could you can apply this at the very practical level of like you moving your own body around when there's large groups of people and watching The Herd mentality play out it is very difficult often for people to do like people are terrified of public speaking for good reason like for thousands of tens of thousands of years if you were standing in front of a large group of other humans they were probably about to kill you you're either their leader or they were going to kill you something bad's gonna happen this should be of course it's terrifying uh and learning how to become their leader is not instinctual I think it maybe for certain sub certainly not for me it took me a long time to get practice uh some some degree of just practicing uh to not feel terrified in front of groups and then do enjoy it and like I don't think leaders are terrified they they love the crowd or like but even bruing Bruce springring says he still gets nervous when he goes and plays and then he has to like hack his brain to believe that that that's like energy can harness to give the fans what they want yeah like you've mentioned a couple things like just like that brute sping the mindset hacking your mind are you big into mindset uh I think any founder is it's a it's very hard for people to understand what a roller coaster it is emotionally um and how painful like the lows are pretty low and and the high and the low can come in the same day you punch in the face constantly and uh yeah you can get pretty down you need to have release mechanisms and hacks and ways to get yourself back up uh because it's not it's certainly not not for everybody can tell you a little hack I do um that maybe maybe is useful for for anybody out there so I have a slack Channel called literally highs and lows and what I do is that anytime there's a high or a low I'll go post it there the beautiful thing about it because of the slack Channel you could just scroll up and realize you're like three months ago oh yeah I remember that felt like kind of the end of the world that felt really bad and now I I don't it's like a stub toe it's like do you remember how your last stub toe felt like is this like a private channel is this for yourself it's me and my co-founder so we do this and I do this in across every business I have and so whether it's a high I and then I go back and I get humbled immediately by a low I'm like okay don't don't get too high on your own Supply here or it's a low currently and I'm like well I've already gone through if you just scroll up I've already conquered a bunch of mountains like this before I've dealt with this I'll be fine and it's like an immediate like kind of perspective machine and it's not even like somebody else perspective it's like I also was in the same channel three months ago saying the same thing wolf basically about this high or this low and um neither neither are as good or as bad as they seem in the moment it's yeah I like that I might try that but it's it's very hard for another non founder to appreciate how difficult that is my my wife's uh is a former journalist Tech reporter in fact oh nice and her uh watching my ride firsthand watching is the wrong word participating in it um has really kind of I she's like man I wish I would have known this side of the thing when I was writing about tech comp and understood like because you know I think Tech reporters are um they all reporters play a very important function of like holding the powerful accountable but like Founders are not that powerful we're kind of suffering through like right you know we're up against some very powerful forces in the world like we feel like we're the ones like trying to you know speak truth to power and fight for the low guy and stuff and then me meantime the the narrative within the media has been like oh the tech that you know the founders are the ones that we have to hold accountable be like what about this like multi-billion dollar trillion almost tens of billion dollar Mega corporation that I compete with like I'm right I'm kind of pathetic sometimes I mean we beat them every day but like sometimes they're better than us at certain things and like we're trying to get better we get better much faster than they do but we're not always the best we're starting out like especially as an early stage founder you have another one of the life philosophies that was simple it had no extra words so I want kind of want you to hear I kind of want to hear your explanation of it you said you can just do things what does that motto do for you oh I I don't know I think there's this idea that you need somebody's permission to do I mean you should have it's why by the way the uh a law class is useful for people if you're in under God take try to get like into a basic class class yeah law like don't break the law but you should have an understanding what's legal and what's not chat gpg is pretty amazing for this but in general like it's not illegal you can just do it uh and there's a lot of things that people are expecting you know we come up through this like education system where it's everything's gated and you can't get to 12th grade math until you finish 11th grade math or whatever and you don't get to go to college unless you get these grades and stuff so within the institutions of the world like yeah there's you can't just do things you have to follow the rules but like in the real world that's not how it works like there's no boss like waiting to tell you what you can do a lot of people are believe that they have to raise Venture Capital to start a company for example and like well maybe you should think of a different idea that doesn't need any money and just do it and that's what we did and we raised VC after 10 years of doing companies without right yeah you don't need to have like the victim mindset you have um you on the YC application there's this question about like what the YC application is not long either so if the question's on there it must have some value there's only like seven questions on the on the whole application and it was a it's what's an example of a real world system that you've hacked meaning like kind of like this like you could just do things or not following the crowd finding the side door into something I asked a my friend sheal who I think invested in flexport early on I go hey I got Ryan on the podcast today what's a good Ryan story from early days he goes oh there's a bunch he gave me one he goes he bought AdWords for the keyword um Uber promo and just put his own promo code there and just got a bunch of cheap Uber rides for himself that way is that true did you do that I got I I became Uber's best customer lifetime probably because I did I got like $10,000 in Uber credits by doing that and then I treated Uber like it was free because it was free for me for a while and I probably net out nett it out to spending like I bet you that you know I I spent way too result um yeah that was a good hack I didn't come up with that I copied it from a friend but uh you know what's funny is I had two friends that did that and I never it never occurred to me to also do that right like I just assumed it was done because other people had done it and uh I think they kind of shut it down I'm not sure I'm not sure it was even bad like I think I paid for Google's Edwards campaign for or Uber's Edwards campaign for them so we had this dude call into the podcast once and he's a guy in India and what he was doing was he realized there's an Arbitrage where Uber had this like cred like kind of um you give credits to somebody and then you'll get credits right that was the the kind of like the PayPal give get 10 type of model but what they didn't do was they didn't account for Geographic differences at the time so he would just get a bunch of people in India to sign up he'd give them you know $10 of uber credits which is like a big deal and they would sign up and they would take a ride and a ride in India is really cheap and he would get $10 of credits and he would sell it to Americans and so I bought thousands of dollars of credits off this guy and I rode really really cheap because you could buy like five grand of credits for like $1,000 because this guy was farming them in India basically and this worked for years and he called into the podcast and he was like literally in like a small apartment in rural India and he was like it's a he's like I make you know like but I forgot what it was like $15,000 a month which is more than like my entire Village makes basically doing this he goes I don't know how long it'll last that's why I'm still living here I'm just saving it up for now but eventually they'll close this loophole and when they do you know that'll be a sad day but uh it was amazing to see that that loophole that hack yeah I I definitely uh sped through the credits pretty quick and then just became ug's biggest C for a long time now now I mostly ride my bike and I stopped riding were to work one thing I find fascinating is you have a side hustle and I find this interesting when entrepreneurs have these like side things that just work right off the bat you did this one about phone boots like phone boots in companies could you just quickly tell this story because I think it's kind of inspiring yeah well unfortunately it closed down uh they sold the company and I didn't make any money uh I think it was kind of mismanaged to be honest uh we we basically it it started at P sport um we never had enough confence rooms or uh and so I made I got this Carpenters on Craigslist to make a couple of phone boosts out of just like wood built it phon within our office at flexport and put like a lot of foam padding in there to make it somewhat soundproof and they were terrible the ones I made myself on Craigslist because I didn't put uh we put a fan but not enough ventilation so you'd come out of this thing just dripping in sweat and yet people were in there non-stop using it I was like if the product's this bad and yet everybody wants to use it there's like something here yeah so my friend Henrik um who's the founder of airel really ran with this idea should give him all the credit he built it into a company uh I kept talking about it there another thing to do is like talk about your business ideas that add parties and stuff and if everybody want I every time I talked about this idea with Founders they'd be like I want to buy five of them and we're like oh man I should just start this company I've got like a waiting list to buy the stuff um so made like this really nice Swedish design and now that the company's failed or been sold I can tell you the IP is the secret here the intellectual property was we didn't we put three fans in that thing the genius the genius hack so we was doing like $50 million in sales 50 yeah we're selling thousands of them and somehow we couldn't make money I was very frustrated we hired a CEO just the unit economics wrong or the overhead was problem people on the team spending money on PS I'm not sure what happened I'm I'm a little pissed about it because it's like dude you're selling $50 million at the phers you should make 10 million in profit at least like the high margin all right somebody should reboot this idea and just do it do it without the mismanagement I I believe so uh now it might have become very competitive space there's a lot of people at the time there was no good cheap phone booth out there trying to make like I think we sold them for like three grand but you can make a phone Boo for a th000 bucks like come on it's not that hard so yeah I think I think in the you could just do things category I'm going to put this in there I think somebody could just do this again yeah yeah feel free to run with that one because that company didn't work they sold to somebody but I think the founder had ambition to be like billion dollar unicorn company instead of like dude let's let's sell this thing to Staples for $50 million and like be happy right exactly Ryan thanks for coming on man this is this has been fun I'm a user of flexport I use it for my econ Biz you you've helped me forward a bunch of freight I I here's how I know you've helped me I still don't know what Freight for really is and we've done you know tens of millions you know a year in revenue and that's the beauty of it I don't have to know I just know that our [ __ ] gets taken care of it's a low price it's the easiest to use tool so thank you for for making that happen uh thank you for import genius also because I would have never found my supplier had I not used that where should people follow you uh and and find out more I'm on Twitter my uh handle on x.com types fast is my handle uh and go to flex.com if you're a Ecom business or you run it kind of logistics you need to ship things from anywhere to anywhere we we started in Freight forwarding which is well I joke it should be called Freight email forwarding Sean like passing emails around the world to get a container or some air freight moved but last year we acquired chifi Logistics and now we do direct to Consumer fulfillment all the way to the door as well as like distribution into Amazon FBA handling that problem of like getting appointments and managing all of that so um helping Brands solve problems in their supply chain is what we're all about there we go by the way your at your handle is types fast and I love it your brothers is types faster ultimate big brother move uh for him to do that it was true he does typ faster than me all right Ryan thanks so much man thank you [Music]

on if you're building The Impossible we got Tommy like Tommy Potter like Harry Potter and then there's no there's no meeting place there's no information there's no way in and there's no way out of this club do I have cor it's a to on the shoulder just like the CIA we let you know individually where we're going to be meeting dude Sam they're speaking your language already this is some real skull and bone [Music] [ __ ] and and I I I want to preface this is live audience if if Sam and Sean you don't know I I'll Pan the room we got like 65 people here uh ready for you m Some Noise the ecosystem is out here today I know the same is going on down at uiu they got a massive room how many you got in that room there Austin here I'll Pan the camera to real quick um oh wow so but yeah we've did on all points that Tommy said I basically hope get all the amazing Founders as well as entrepreneurs content creators everybody that's doing awesome stuff in the same room down here at UIC um so we're we're we're super pumped on both sides UI is that Illinois Carbondale University of Illinois Urbana champagne the big eye so that's who we are so we got Tommy we got Austin the club is called happy hour is that what you said no we're we're Power Hour oh Power Hour Power Hour got an hour full of power and and it's all student run there's no faculty nobody who's uh who's making this happen is this a like has this been around for 10 years or did you just invent this on Thursday what's going on do you remember Bobby Bobby fire housle which was on this this podcast about two years ago I may never forget Bobby so the Bobby started all of this Bobby started this Bobby started this and it's kind of been planting around and and UI has their Community we're very like deep in our partnership there as well this is so this is fantastic so to give the The Listener background two years ago we had this guy name on Bobby Bobby I think was in Michigan Bobby um gathered like this like group of maybe 15 entrepreneurs and like four of them pitched us and they were awesome and apparently Bobby has Fight Club this thing and gone out from University to University to like convince you guys to join on and this sounds awesome and so today I think six of you so three each are going to pitch us is that right totally correct yeah there's a lot of school pride on the line in terms of which school is going to come out on top in this competition so we're laying it all on the line for you we have you know tons of creators in the audience it was tough to get it down to three three startups but we're giving you our best um so can't wait we're ready to we're ready roll so this is college Shark Tank style two schools pitching from both we're gonna have a winner um we're gonna maybe have a uh a few other awards that we come up with I invested in one of these last time Sam out of uh out of Michigan so I's going company already failed so we're not gonna We're not gonna hold that against y'all you win some you lose some and we lost that one pretty hard pretty quick uh but that's all right all right but let's see if you guys can beat Michigan so the first one that we're going to hear from is meet your class and I think is University of Michigan are you guys doing three in a row and then it's gonna be back and forth all right all right we just need to step aside and let this kid MC this he's got the natural of a host see I'm using College words is it let it bake or let them cook which one is it whatever let we're gonna let him [Laughter] bake all right the first one um is the folks at um uh Michigan okay hello my name is Jonah and I'm the COO of me your class two years ago my co-founders and I created a platform for prospective college students to meet each other before coming to campus and metor class quickly grew in popularity largely because the communities we built actually extended beyond our own platform and integrated with the social media apps that nearly every every high schooler uses on a daily basis within two years this system has scaled to over 400,000 account creations and even generated over $600,000 in Revenue through a premium business model well this was a great success an even larger opportunity emerged when we were approached by a university called the Christ College which was struggling with enrollment basically they were having issues filling seats and they were alone this is a really big issue recent polls have found that over 2third of University CFOs are deeply concerned about declining enrollment a really big factor in this that the Christ college and really the majority of universities across the country struggle with is a phenomenon known as summer melt summer melt refers to when a prospect gets all the way to the tail end of the enrollment funnel just to at the last second reeg on their deposit re on their commitment and decide they no longer want to go to college at the CH College believe it or not this was happening with every one in3 students which eventually was leading to a 33% vacancy rate at the school the CH College believed the meter class could help decrease the summer melt because our platform had gained a reputation as being able to build up excitement for prospective students and also to give them a support network furthermore we also found through discovery that metor class data was very valuable for universities in helping them to allocate their limited time and resources towards students who needed the extra attention and help and we're very excited to say that this worked at the Christ college students who used Meer class last year experienced a 61% reduction in summer melt which is expected to add $1.7 million back to their Top Line and we're so excited by results because at a minimum this summer melt issue is calculated to cost the higher education system over 11 billion dollar per year and it's of course going to take more than one case study to really go after this Market but luckily we now have skilled to eight partners for the upcoming admission cycle and amazingly that same B Toc business that I described at the start is helping us and empowering us to create a product that's industry-leading being loved by students and administrators it also got us admitted to Tech Stars and has allowed us to bootstrap our way into a much larger much more qualified team ready to take the higher ed Market by storm [Applause] wow all right that was great we do you have an ending for us so sharks who's ready to you know blah blah blah and are you raising are you actually raising money or not not not raising money right now we're planning to potentially open a seed round when we graduate in the spring okay great that is awesome that is awesome all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think uh by the way of the $600,000 in Revenue uh how many people are working there what's your profit do you have any profit um yeah so us as initial co-founders have not paid ourselves a dime and we reinvest every single penny back into the team um so I don't know the exact profitability off the top of my head you know we try to keep the bank account enough to stay alive but we we reinvest every penny back into growing the team and getting to more University Partnerships and we're trying to get 50 by the end of this upcoming admission cycle of of the 600,000 how much is in your business account right now I think around 300,000 uh we we got 120,000 from Tech Stars and then have' also won some Pitch competitions okay okay cool and Blake uh your name is Blake right my name is Jonah Blake is my amazing co-founder okay great so Jonah great first great pitch uh really cool business at first when you were talking about it I thought well you know you sort of created Facebook 20 years too late you're trying to help college kids connect but then what the story got really interesting when you started talking about how colleges are struggling to fill enrollment and they have vacancies just like a hotel has vacancies a college has vacancies and that maybe your tools actually could help them decrease that and then then they would be your customer right you'd be charging them did you charge that first college and what are you charging those other eight colleges who you said are partners with you on this yeah so our initial partners are heavily discounted relative to like the market rate for a solution like this because we're trying to get more logos more case studies currently those partners are at under $10,000 but there's a very clear path to scaling this once we have a bit more credibility under our name you said market rate who else is doing something like this and what are they doing we do have a handful of competitors so this initial thing that we're describing is called like midf funnel conversion it's basically getting people who are later on in the enrollment funnel and then trying to convert them um there's a few competitors listed in that second column where we really stand out from them is our Integrations with social media because we're able to get a large organic user base at the earliest and latest stages of the enrollment funnel so a lot of our competitors are like third party apps where the university basically emails all their students says Hey download this and kind of forces them to use it and the reason they do that is because these communities generate so much valuable data and they have a lot more control over it um and social media Standalone really doesn't do this for them because it's not a tailor made higher tool higher ed tool so we're basically retrofiting these social media platform forms and bringing all the data that they pay for these so Jonah if you were charging them what you think you can charge them have you had any conversations about how much they would be willing to pay either as a percentage of sort of Saved students or as a flat fee what's your sense of how much each college going to pay you so initially just for this midf funnel conversion tool we believe that it should be pretty reasonable of course like colleges varying size but we've seen these at lowest for the small smallest schools around $20,000 and then we've seen them scale past 200,000 um this is of course just like one small part of the enrollment funnel there's many more issues that we believe were Prim to solve that's just a generally like I I almost want to say a commoditized rate that University is like comfortable paying with is this the biggest problem or is there a bigger problem this is one of the biggest problems um as I mentioned for the Christ College one in three students were melting so when we were so it's just like kind of like the lowest hanging fruit to initially go after because these are kids who arguably should be going to college they got very they got way to the tail end of the enrollment funnel and then we then converted more of them um but they obviously wanted to just get more bus and seas throughout the entire process Jonah how's this um you know I always ask how the story ends uh is there a vision for where you where you going to be in 10 years with this um we're still trying to figure that out we are very motivated by genuinely improving the student experience and making it so college is worthwhile so in the long run we want to put power back in the students hands a lot of students don't know that they have negotiation power and the tuition price and a lot of them also end up at places that are suboptimal so we kind of want to the long run become the go-to place that students come to and they figure out where they're going to be the most successful to for 10 years down the line did you just say that you could negotiate tuition price because I had no idea that was possible it is possible um I I personally Didn't Do It um some members of my team could speak to it a lot more but students have a lot more power than they realize universities need students in order to stay in business the majority of schools um not the University of Michigan but the majority of schools are tuition dependent for Revenue tuition in Michigan is like a very small percentage of Revenue so if you ask for decreased tuition here that likely would not pan out because they're not really struggling with any Financial situations but at the end of the day colleges need to act like a business otherwise they're going to go under I was just Googling some of these companies Sean have you heard of UN were you did you Google any of those Community apps I had no idea this stuff existed some of them are actually quite large how big uh unibody I think raised $30 million they raised it during covid so there's you know TBD if it's legit but uh it seems like it's a business that does many tens of millions in Revenue yeah Jonah my quick take on this I think you actually have a real business here um one of the biggest Investments I missed on was the very first guy who ever pitched me as an angel investor he had a idea for uh something called apply board and what he was doing was helping International students get into he was helping like kind of these small colleges get more International students because International students just didn't know their name I I had never heard of Christ College till you just said it and um he was charging about two to three thou he was charging the university2 to three thousand per student that actually got admitted um and enrolled there and so he was making you know tons of money so that that company really took off so I think you I think you have a real business here the only thing I would say I guess to to wrap up is I don't think you should ever raise money for this I think you should bootstrap this thing and if you actually just stuck with this idea and you bootstrapped it you know in four or five years you would be sitting on probably $20 million which would be a phenomenal place for you to be exiting this business and um I think the biggest risk for you is not a business risk it's a we raise money because we pitch investors that this could take over the world because we thought that's what we're supposed to do we thought you have an idea you pitch investors you raise round one round two round three and suddenly we're looking at you saying how are you going to be a billion dollar company and the reality is this might be a phenomenal $50 $50 million doll company but no chance at a billion dollar company so my my advice to you would be don't raise but great pitch overall Sam any last thoughts I completely agree completely agree Jonah thank you big round of [Applause] applause all right all right so where are we going now Illinois yeah we've got uh our guy out in uh San Francisco right now Shar so what's going on guys nice to meet you all right I love it you drop out what you're not even in college what's going on no I'm actually uh on a gap semester as Sean I'm in Founders Inc I know you know safan background so just met him yesterday a couple me me and my couple of my buddies are I'm just visiting San Francisco here seeing if this is the right place for us but yeah all right well Gap here I like I like the sound that already about a year ago me and my co-founder watching the Spanish TV show Money Heist on Netflix unfortunately neither of us know Spanish very well so we had to watch it English dubbed anyone who's ever watched a dubb movie knows that there's a bunch of issues the lips are not synchronized with the audio the voice actors sound nothing like the actual actors there's one scene where two voice actors had the same actor making everything extremely confusing we looked in this issue a bit further and found that it is extremely technically complex expensive at $100 to $1,500 per minute timec consuming and low quality to dub a video nowadays with all of this dubbing is a $60 billion Doll Market in 2022 and there's been no clear solution for this we started by translating content for creators like Mr Beese and Mr Nightmare and found that their essential use Cas is within education imagine the millions of uh people trying to get an education in their second language where the content is not meant for them so we created metapo an automated authentic and a aable translation solution for educators all the user has to do is input a video into our solution press input and output language press submit and within minutes get a lip sync voice clone and text onscreen translated video just like this one that we translated for our client UI and geese and cors utilitarianism suggests that an ethical choice will lead to the greatest good for the greatest number of people that's pretty good so as you can see professor's voice is perfectly clone from English to Spanish to French his lips are synchronized and our key differentiator is any text on screen is translated with the same font text and color as well for our Enterprise clients we have a human and loop process where we translate videos with industry specific terminology keywords adoms none of that Google translate um issues we also have the most languages and cheest product on the market right now we're at $6,000 in monthly recurring Revenue translating videos for University of Illinois and corporations like velcro Corporation we actually are in talks with corser for a potential integration in quarter 1 of 2025 as well just a look at one of our potential deals after our paid pilot with Geese just one degree looks like 30,000 minutes in five languages generating $1.35 million in revenue for our company this actually saves the university 91% in actual cost and curating the course as well our team combines Business and Technology with myself taking a gap year to focus on this and our machine learning team of five machine learning Engineers having 37 years of experience in computer vision hi my name is Shara kala and my purpose is to break language vares thank you guys very much all right that's awesome great pitch great pitch thank uh and leave some of the slides up so we might need to go back to them so first of all the demo was great can you just tell us a little bit about that the magic there so you said uh translates The Voice makes the lips match which I've never seen anyone do that did you see Dana White do that Sean you didn't see Dana White do that for uh the uh Mexican Independence Day UFC it was great no I didn't see that uh so what are you doing to make the lips is it is it superimposed on top of of their lips yeah so essentially we take uh one of my buddies YC model we take any original video or any original audio and we got are allowed to synchronize ellipse based on the input of video and audio in our backend system we then curate that you're gonna say you took one of your buddies lips and he's a model so you're saying there's an off-the-shelf Library basically off the shelf model that does this already you guys are just integrating that corre that's true that's true okay and another question you said something like if they did this just one course for one University that's like a million in revenue for you are they currently are you convincing them hey you should dub this or they're already dubbing it just at 10 times the cost yeah so right now they're um translating videos automatedly and they're translating courses like imagine quizzes tests and just like reading papers but they're not translating the videos so a Spanish user has to go on corsera and you know take the course in Spanish but have to read the subtitles on an English video uh for these videos that these courses that they're creating right now um we're basically providing the solution that standardizes the actual viewing experience for the end user so they are doing this right now just without you said that you said I think in 22 or 23 or something like that that dubbing was a 70 or $60 billion what what is that number tell me about that number that's ridiculous um just looking at traditional dubbing this means in film education um marketing just translation in general huge Market bunch of different positions that we could put oursel in was trying to tell um you guys that we also translated for Content creators like Mr Beast B nightmare but found that the niche was in education for us just because of the central need um think about the applications of translation for people that have life-changing opportunities strip for them because they can't take a course and in their their preferred language or they're not able to understand the professor in a classroom so that's where we got that number right but a key key distinction you said they're already doing this but but actually the way you said it was they're translating the tests and the quizzes they're just not try they're not doing the videos today and so for them to agree to do this this would be a new cost of of a million dollars to them that they're not currently spending so like in in terms of translating a video in general they're trying to translate these videos but for them for like a person to translate a video just like for a 10-minute video takes four hours they have to curate new slides have a new professor go in you know speak in a new language they have to contract these people this would cost them $3 million to edit these videos um you know go over edit the screen text and there's a big distinction let's say I'm sitting at this University and I look like I am with this vest on right now and I I'm sitting there and I've got my budget but what I'm asking you is today they don't already spend in this you're not saving them money from something they're already spending they're currently not spending because it would be too expensive to do it too slow too expensive and so you're going to be a new cost to them right so that's going to be a big point of friction because they're not going to make more money necessarily off this you might be able to convince them that if you do this you might be able to get more customers but day one it's going to be just extra cost with no extra revenue is that correct uh that is true however they are going in the direction of putting these courses online digital um translation is a thing that they're already doing this would just be an added cost for them at the end of the day but it would provide a better solution potentially being a marketing play for international students to come to the university as well but to answer your question yet what are you doing for velcro first of all I didn't I didn't know velcro was a brand I thought velcro was like clean exertion you know I thought it was a thing that's pretty wild but what are you doing for them and how did you close those guys because they look like a big old old sluggish company yeah uh we had a personal connection to one of the higher ups of the company we do internal Communications for them so um every month there's a 90-minute internal Town Hall where the CEO basically speaks in English she's Italian woman um she had a bunch of issues with when she's speaking English she lacks emotion she kind of um doesn't feel like herself and we were able to provide them a solution where she was able to provide the company with updates in her true Persona in the new language by speaking in Italian for 90 minutes into our camera we put that into our solution within three hours we able to create a translated video that she's able to send all the plants at voal Corporation in 10 different languages and we provide that solution to them today but it sounds like you're you're not doubling down as much on Enterprise you want to go for this University education Niche is that right so we want to go into um the education Niche this is universities this can mean educational content creation this can mean um corporate trainings as well we understand that these educational sales Cycles are extremely long which is why uh going to these translation a agencies for educational content as well can help us kind of uh apply like a geometric approach to our sales cycle as well um just to speed everything up faster having having us get more traction to and then the university brand itself creates a stance where people say hey University of Illinois use this I'm an educational content creator I trust them I'm going to trust this company as well right well I think you have a solid pitch and I think you have a really great product but I think this is a product in search of a market um I think you're going to run into a lot of trouble because you're going to go to these universities and you're going to say hey we're great and they're going to say yeah that's awesome but they have no budget they they won't have the budget for it or it's just going to be seen as an extra cost without a clear extra payoff uh or sort of Roi attached to it um and so I think that's going to hurt the sales cycle what's already a slow sales cycle is University sales I think it's going to get harder because you're costing the money rather than saving the money um but one thing to consider is if if there's already a big market for dubbing out there and they're doing it manually this is actually could look like a private Equity play where you go buy existing dubbing services that have existing books of business and then you just fire all the people and replace it with the AI That's going to do it better and faster and cheaper than they're currently doing you said it cost like a $100 a minute or whatever to to dub with with humans doing it and so what you could do is you could go buy companies and then rip out the cost structure by replacing it with AI and that might be actually be a better way to go to go into this market and again this something that you don't really hear a lot you're in San Francisco now a lot of people don't talk about this but there is a whole other Avenue of business you know rollups and private Equity where um they're looking for this they buy something at a fair price and then they slash the cost in half by using technology to make things more efficient you could do that here understood and um we're actually are trying to do that right now partnering with the translation agency to understand exactly um how they derive their clients um how they are going through these sales Cycles with um like refugees people that are going through different educational content the one thing about universities is that I do seeing this being globalized in um systems and and learning management systems like corsera so we just had a meeting yesterday with corsera to essentially say at the University of Illinois pilot goes well they're willing to give us a shot at an integration for translation for a couple of courses there um that would you know allow us to dub from going like a thousand minutes for every two week to maybe a th hours for every two weeks um just to just to show you the kind of stance that we're taking in terms of universities we're going for the Learning Management Systems not the individual University hey Sean I don't pay attention to this world too much but um how that video that we saw how impressive was that I mean it's definitely impressive and I think they're doing a couple other things that are specific like changing the text on the screen uh so I think you know that that makes the whole solution work because then the actual course works so it's it's definitely impressive but I you know there's got to be 10 other companies that could do this today or you know there's nothing like um scientific breakthrough with what they're doing so this is really going to be a question of who builds the best business around this new technology the technology exists and anyone's going to be able to build a business around this so it's really going to be about who figures out the right Market the right go to market strategy the right pricing model to actually build the business out of this what do your parents think about you taking the Gap here we got into we got into Tech Stars in June ended up declining that my parents are South Indian um they kind of are driven by you know percentages like Prestige was able to show them that hey maybe I'm like top 1% of preed companies by getting this accelerator I'm show them that they let me take this scap semester and then um G have to show them some kpis to keep on uh taking taking time off of school but I'm loving it right now hope they listen to this hey kids or parents your kids's amazing this is he's gonna it's GNA it's going to turn out all right it's G to turn out more than all right I think there's a kid at f think where you're at right now that office you're at right now there's a kid there uh it's not a kid anymore his name is Johnny Dallas um and he was in eighth grade when he started working with us and he started in the summer and then he started working every day after school and then I think in 11th grade or so it was pretty clear this guy's awesome and he should just work here full-time and we made him an offer and his mom was freaking out couldn't I can't my son's gonna be a high school dropout this is crazy no no no he's going to test out he's going to graduate he's going to get his GED and um what I convinced her of was he not dropping out he's going pro the same way LeBron James went pro because he had incredible skills and that reframe I got to tell you that was some of my best work with that Mom on a bench in a park convincing her that he's going pro he's not dropping out and then we got him to got him to go full-time with us got you got you dude congratulations on your success good job and thank you for letting us listen and uhh you're the man um all right what do we have next I'm Nathan shots co-founder of milu and we are creating personalized skincare that's built for your microbiome my journey with microbiology began when I was eight after I had a life-threatening encounter with a flesh eating bacteria this experience sparked a fascination with the world of microbes like bacteria and fungi since then I've been driven to understand how the skin microbiome which is the trillions of microbes living on our bodies affects human health let me paint you a picture think of the skin microbiome as a city a complex community of microbes each with a unique job just like these little guys on the screen in our skin City help manage inflammation others retain moisture and some even fight off viruses this microbiome is unique to each person like a fingerprint and its well-being is essential for healthy and beautiful skin but here's the problem many common skincare products contain preservatives and harsh chemicals that are detrimental to your skin microbiome using these is like dropping a nuke on your microbiome City leading to chaos and any number of skin problems acne dryness anti-aging and other common sking concerns drive a $150 billion industry yet most products rely on an outdated one siiz fits-all approach that overlooks our unique biology this leads to a frustrating cycle of trial and error where consumers waste their time and their money looking to the right product for their skin often to no avail people need skincare that is hyper-personalized and that is why millio is different we create skincare that works with your unique microbiome so here's how we're changing the game meet the mill biome sense system this is a

more and join us in make Personal Care truly about you thank you for hey hold on brother keep that up I'm G to try it go for it all right there you go this is pretty cool when I thought microbiome what did you immediately think I thought it was gut yeah I thought it was gut and poop I was like do I got to I got to poop at a thing and you're going to give me a thing to help my skin but that's I didn't know that skin microbiome was a thing that's prettyer how's your skincare routine uh you know body wash that goes on my armpits also goes on my face it's not very good but I'm I'm bought into the idea that it is important and I H I I I do want to get better so this is interesting to me do you have any Revenue at all no Revenue we're currently in development we're doing beta testing okay gotcha and uh really smooth pitch by the way you are a a talker that was really well done um okay so let's give some thoughts on this so dud by the way his deck Sean was great those those cartoons they told the story wonderfully yeah who made who made all that you made that the the deck and the story yeah no one made it that's just my story well it made it like the graphics are cool oh the deck yeah uh my my co-founder Ron and I worked on it and then we also worked chopped it with like a bunch of other students in the community so gotcha okay um you know one thing I think that would help you is um this type of story I think would go viral on Tik Tok like basically what you told us if you were like um I used to think skincare routine well I I used to think you know I whatever I didn't care about my skin and then I got a flesh eating bacteria this is me after my trip to Costa Rica and you show a picture you're like um so here's what I did to get rid of this and while never look get any of these skincare products the same again knock over a bunch of bottles on a table right you do something like that you're going to get like two million views on a Tik Tok you can actually include that in this which is going to be like we know how to tell our story and get out there and that that story resonates with people that people are looking for something that's more personalized that's actually science-based and not just you know a fancy brand um and we're going to use content to our advantage and that's how we're going to have much cheaper customer acquisition right the smart brands in the DDC are basically content first right now they know how to tell their story on Tik Tok and Instagram and YouTube and that's where they're getting just like a a sort of runaway growth compared to everybody else who just doing very basic static ads on Facebook type of thing yeah absolutely I mean we observe that many of our competitors sunk a ton of their initial Revenue into advertising and so we're looking at sort of a different goto Market strategy we want to please 50 people in our beta testing we want to work like very closely with with a smaller group of people to make sure that our product and our algorithm is really working the way that it's supposed to before we go like Mass Market um but I like the idea of doing short form content because I know it definitely hits with uh with the younger audience which is target market yeah who's your competitors so are there other people doing this well there's no one that's doing exactly what we're doing there are skincare companies that do microbiome testing and there are also personalized skincare companies um the biggest skin microbiome company currently is parallel health and they offer a 200 a month uh protocol where they do sequencing on your skin microbiome super high Market high-end product um there's a a company that's successful they've been in business for seven years now called proven Health they were or sorry par or no it's proven skincare they own they were on Shark Tank um and they do personalized skincare that's based off of a quiz only so we we have a quiz and we have microbiome testing so we're sort of the baby between those two ideas a lot of times with health stuff uh he Health stuff or skin anything involving your body that's very it's very controversial because there's always there's a bunch of people who love something typically and then there's an equal or more amount of haters which doesn't necessarily mean it's wrong it's just health is very controversial um what would the haters say about this like would they say like dude microbiom stuff it's not actually important if you just use these three things it's going to do most of the job you don't need to worry about this other stuff like what are the haters going to say about you I I'd say the biggest like liability there is that the the skin microbiome field is actually very n so the basically we're testing a hypothesis we believe that skin care that's precisely tailored to your microbiome is better than the traditional methods out there I think people would likely continue to hold on to this societal idea that all bacteria is bad or like we need to stay in this sort of sanitized mindset like people really like to feel clean and so I think that that's the biggest objection to this is like we love germs we want to harness the power of the germs that are on your face and we believe they hold a lot of potential so people might be like oh it's gross but you know it's just science science is gross well I I like I think the criticism I'm an idiot but I pay attention to health stuff I think the criticism is like uh you know that's like uh a that that thing will just move the needle by 1% whereas if you do these other things it's mostly gonna get you there and be perfect do do you know what you know what I'm saying Sean yeah 100% it's like in health stuff you can listen to huberman for 92 hours and suddenly you're or Brian Johnson or whatever you're trying to take 42 supplements a day but 80 to 90% of the gains are going to come from like you know good sleep drink water eat clean Whole Foods and if you just do those things and you're not you're probably not already doing those things that'll get you the bulk of it the rest is really like you know on the edge optimizations and I think you're right Sam that you know sort of a smart skeptic would probably um have that thought but I don't think that's what's going to drive success or failure in this case so I think actually one thing you were missing from your pitch is to convince me that people care about hyper personalization and that that's where the puck is going and really what you want in a pitch is for this to feel like an in inevitable outcome of what's go What's Happening Here of what's happening in this space whether it's you or somebody else that's sort of secondary but you really want to convince investors of two things one inevitably this is where the puck is going and that inevitably we are going to be the ones who take advantage score when that puck gets there right so you kind of need to make two cases when you make a pitch and so for example I know that in hair care and kind of beauty products makeup products there's a lot of this already the trend has gone in this direction where isn't it like PE they you do quizzes and you figure out oh I have curly hair and my problem is that it's uh dry and then for that you're going to get a certain product and I think what you would want to show is that the companies that came out in the last wave for beauty products that went the personalization route have outperformed have had all these really great exits but nobody's done it for skincare yet but they will and here's what they're here's what's going to happen in skincare the same thing that just happen in makeup and hair is going to happen for skin right same thing that just happened in vitamins is gonna happen for skin and that makes it sort of feel inevitable oh my God he's right there the next wave of successful skincare companies are going to use this kind of science-based hyper-personalized um thing that I think was missing from your pitch so that's kind of my feedback for you thank you that's good that's very good feedback I thought you did a great job telling the story I'm still I'm still trying to understand what I already asked that question but like the other answers could have been like uh everyone agrees that this is right but the the question that we're trying to figure out is can we or anyone even figure this out like I wanted to figure out like what's going to be what ises this all hinge on because if you're talking like on a beta like what's what is this what are you having to convince the world that that that needs to happen in order for this to be a massive breakthrough let let me ask you a very simple question do you believe if let's assume it works do you believe that it's going to be V A visually different result meaning if I just showed you two pictures one person who's using your thing and one person who's just using off-the-shelf stuff honest question do you think it's going to be where I could just point yeah that's clearly better because if it is then all your marketing is going to work that way and if it's not then the the science kind of actually in the world of supplements and and vitamins and and creams let's be honest nobody has a clue if any of this [ __ ] actually works um and so then it's all just a branding game it's all a marketing game it's all who's can convince the consumer that what that if you buy this product you'll be more beautiful and everyone will love you and thing you know things will go well for you in life right so I think we're kind of unless it's literally visual where you can see the difference and it's going to be inarguable then it's just a question of are you going to be a great marketer l'oral why is L'Oreal successful it's not because we know that their their prod product scientifically is better than anybody else's product it's because they're better marketers that's the reality of the situation yeah we we certainly recognize that um we definitely definely want to sort of latch into the the trend towards clean and sustainable Beauty which is why we made a box that you can plant in the ground and it grows flowers we think it's really like the Bea is in the details here so I absolutely agree with you before and after pictures are like one of the best things that we can get and the results of our beta testing are currently looking very promising but uh before I start to make claims and put those pictures on the website I want to do like really really thorough analysis of how the products are working how the algorithm is working to make sure that we have something that is it's really solid all right brother we appreciate you congratulations on this and and and solid pitch we got to go to the next one great job thank [Music] you is brother brother nuts is that is that who's up next it is yeah hey guys my name's Austin Majors I'm the co-founder of Brothers nuts here Brothers nuts our mission is to kick the fake food to the curb and revolutionalize healthy snacking with Organic sprout nut and Seed snacks so first off my family found that half of the snacks out there weren't actually healthy and the other half tasted like garbage but first off why did we create this business well our business started back in 2010 actually when my father was diagnosed with stage four brain cancer he was given seven weeks to live and through the changes in diet and lifestyle turned that seven weeks into seven years but one of the biggest issues him and my family had was finding a snack that was as healthy as it was tasty and so our current day CFO AKA Chief flavor officer AKA mom being the amazing Mom that she is went into work and created what is now known as the crackled cheesy almonds now my family and my friends were astonished to see that these were as healthy as they were flavorful but also very crunchy and that's what makes us very different all of our nuts and seeds are sprouted but how's it gone over the last seven years so I started this company was 13 years old when my father passed away with my older brother who was 15 and over the last seven years we've done over a million dollars in sales we sold over a million dollars worth of nuts we're in currently available in 200 retail locations and the future is very promising we have a clear path forward over the next four years to take this business to $10 million in sales and be a national brand how are we going to do that we're going to do that by doing the hard work that no one else wants to do and I know no one else wants to do it because I speak to these stores and no one else is doing it so what is that first of all it's expanding and making more money from our current clients clients like fresh time Mom's graic Market Fresh Market but it's also expanding distribution and getting new grocery stores like Whole Foods Sprouts HB key accounts how are we going to how are we're going to grow within those stores we're continue shaking hands doing what I just did for you guys telling my story having people try the product and letting people know that there's something out there like this and last we're going to continue innovating through our product right now we're developing a clean chocolate almond and we also have a we're developing a high protein variant of our most popular flavors something that's never been done in this space now kind of more Grand scale I mean there's 62,000 grocery stores the nut Market is selling $10 billion this year I look at the biggest companies out there and we can absolutely get there but what's really cool is we are on the up and up seed oil free we that sprouted Gooden free gut friendly we check all the boxes finally something that my dad did in 2010 is now mainstream and we are on The Cutting Edge of it in the last period over period products labeled sprouted grew 34% in their velocities and sales we are on the up and up but let's remember why we're doing this look the reason why we're able to have the success why we're able to land these retailers get through these to these Gatekeepers is because we're doing this in every sale that we're making in Milestone it's contributing to continuing my father's Legacy everything we're doing is to grow his legacy and to create my own along with my brothers because we know that by changing what people snack on every single day will lead them to live longer better healthier lives with their families and so if you're ready to join us to kick the fake food to the curb and evolve the way you snack I'd love to talk to you right dude that that was great man I got goosebumps uh what Amazing Story good good for you dude I'm I'm really happy to to hear about this this Austin I just placed a $52 order I'm gonna try the cheesy ones the garlic ones and the spicy basil pumpkin seeds so let's see what you're about we'll throw some extra stuff in there for you this is great so you um you're in some stores today can you just give us the the basic rundown so how many stores are you currently in and is that one chain or multiple what's going on yeah so it's multiple chains our very first store that gave us our shot was fresh time Market there about 70 stores across the Midwest I mean the story with that is my brother cold called the CEO got a cold got a call back in the lunchroom of the senior year of high school we sat down with the team got three stores proved ourselves in three stores they gave us 30 we proved ourselves again they gave us 70 stores only give you those that that many allow you to expand if you're selling well so after we had that success story we went out and we targeted smaller chains like Mom's Organic Market on the East Coast The Fresh Market which we're starting off small with and with that data we've we're now going to new stores like we met with Whole Foods we got a yes from them we got pushed back we're fighting get a bigger and better yes and we have a huge Mee with Sprouts tomorrow actually wow uh and so and what was the what's the revenue so far yeah so since Inception over seven years we've sold over a million dollars worth of nuts this year alone we'll do 400,000 last year 200,000 and next year with some of the launches that we're planning we'll do probably closer to two million and what did the retailers tell you so that that fresh time that that you're in you're sorry you're in 70 stores with them or they have 70 stores no we're in all 70 of their stores we're in a total of 200 retail stores across the country from some of those bigger players and some just smaller one-off stores health food stores golf courses and like you know the way that retail works is they need to see the velocity of you know how much you're selling on the Shelf at their stores for you to get into more stores and so what data do you have and is that currently a strength is it a weakness what what what's going on with the current uh cycle cycle rate or whatever they call it for retail consumption yeah so the velocities and the data is the biggest thing so our product is incredibly unique in that we are one of the only ones who offer a product like ours we have very few competitors can name them and so what we have to do is of course first demonstrate a gap on the Shelf hey you are not you don't have any nut flavored nut options that organic sprouted and then contain no seed oils so first we have to do that and then we just show share the data I mean our velocities if they were bad and if that was an issue we fresh time would not have let us go from 3 to 30 to 70 stores they came to us we didn't have to approach them on that we were just killing it so much okay okay fair fair enough um I feel like you answered a question that should be answered in numbers with letters that's okay um all right so here's the problem that I have with this business I like I like your name I like your story I really want to try your nuts all right but here's the problem um when I go to your Tik Tok I see 50 followers and when you're young you have a lot of disadvantages you're not going to have the same level of experience you're not going to have the same amount of funding and resources you're not going to have the supply chain experience that you're gonna that your competitors all have um but you do have a story and what you should be is amazing at social media um there you should be telling your story on social media you should be getting people excited about this and taking that to the retailers and saying look we're this young exciting brand that consumers really care about and consumers are excited about and you don't have an option like that your your the nut shelf for you guys is stale it's just blue diamond and it's the same old brands that do the same old thing and they're not they're not on on Trend they're not C oil free they're not whatever right you have that story but you need the social side to be Kick-Ass because social just takes creativity it doesn't take money and you're part of the generation that should be better at this than whoever the CEO of blue diamond is they they're you know their social strategy obviously going to be pretty boring and so I think that's where you're dropping the ball and that's what you're going to need to get into retail because I've talked to retailers and what they care about is they need to they need to believe uh that you are going to help Drive traffic to the store or that customers care about your brand and that they're they're adding young hot Brands to the Shelf um that's that's what you need as your story so I think that's what's missing for me right now absolutely yeah who uh with the family business like this do you and your brother are you the two owners or is your mother involved who who owns the company yeah so my brother and I are 50-50 owners um we do have my mom who is our chief flavor officer she's in charge of making sure the nuts taste as good as they do I mean she's the original person who created these recipes and we just took him and started selling them dude this is awesome congratulations I um I'm bought in with Sean as well on the story the story was very good I saw your about page I saw the personality I was like all right this is definitely going to be something interesting I'm now a customer I'm very eager to try it but this is pretty badass um Sam do do you remember the name of that nuts brand that um he's kind of like on Twitter he might be is that it it's like a peanut butter brand right yeah they do uh many eight figures a year in Revenue many eight figures so tens of millions of dollars in Revenue yeah um have you have you looked at these guys uh Austin yeah I'm familiar with them and I think they just got popular on social media um and their stick is different than yours theirs is like the opposite of of yeah it's like indulge versus what you're trying to do but you do have like I've invested in a bunch of these like uh seed oil or uh uh seed oil free companies um I think TBD if it's going to be mainstream yet but it definitely seems like it might be uh but this is like super fascinating you have a lot of Tailwinds uh to help you out here for sure I think you want to include that in your pitch by the way so um you know an investor doesn't really know how big a nuts brand can be and your numbers while you know I'm not saying that they're bad they are on the small side for like an e-commerce company right so you if you're you know we've done a million dollars across seven years okay that's not that's not huge I think you got to a picture that this can actually be really big I looked up blue diamonds by the way blue diamonds says about 1.8 billion a year in Revenue correct so I would show uh the nut category is huge and you know you have blue diamond does 1.8 billion in sales a year the next one does this next one does this and we we use this phrase on MFM that there's a sea of sameness they all you walk down that aisle and it's all old Brands there's not one Challenger brand and all of them have the same problem that're they're lacking XYZ um we have fresh packaging we're a challenger brand we have we have a better story we're hot on social media so I think you need that part of the story and I would include others like nerdy nuts and I would show examples of others who have come into this category and are doing very well and how you're the next in line again it's that sort of er of inevitability that you want to paint and so when you don't have the traction that shows that your own trajectory is inevitable you want to show the inevitability of a category of a change um some of the things you talked about about you know uh sprouted products are growing 34% year-over-year in these stores you know that's kind of like you want slides there because it feels like every category now has a sprouted product and the sprouted products are overperforming guess what nuts doesn't have a sprouted product we are that that sprouted nut right and so you want to paint that picture for for the investor but really good overall and honestly I actually think of all the business we heard today I think this is probably the one that could be the biggest yeah but I don't think you're using your strengths and I think uh if you keep going on the same path you're going it won't be huge but you're still young and you you have time to change if you actually like take some of the feedback and do it I think this could actually be a lot bigger awesome thank you so much yeah uh thank you man you're the best um awesome Majors thank you very much all right we have the last one from University of Michigan right all right Hi Sam Sean mfmf We Are Tour the AI part salesperson for property managers today only four % of apartment prospects that ever land on an apartment website actually end up taking the inperson tour and it's no surprise that the in-person tour is the highest converting part of the apartment sales process I mean there's nothing like someone giving you a guided experience of something you're about to buy but when 96% of the potential prospects that hit your digital storefront never get the chance to experience your tour that highest converting sales moment in the apartment process well leads get missed yeah these leads gets missed and these apartments are left of hundreds of thousands of dollars of missed opportunities and Unleashed vacancies that could have been filled if these prospects took a tour that is until the apartment installs tour tour helps Apartments like Arbor Apartments scale Mariana their digital salesperson now Mariana doesn't have enough time to tour every single prospect that visits the property in person much less the all the prospects that visit the property online but what if we could recreate marana's best inperson tour and replicate that on the website so that Mariana is on the website for all prospects 247 our property manager just pastes a link to an apartment website we scate the website and generate video scripts that help Mariana with infrastructure to record the tour and scrape combine it all together with a knowledge base into a smart virtual leasing agent once the tour is ready all the company has to do is paste a little piece of code on the website and now Mariana is on the website 247 and when anart when a prospect goes on the website and starts to browse we're actually learning about that Prospect through small digital micro interactions and Mariana can pop out of the right hand corner of the we at the perfect time and ask them if they'd like to take a tour once in the tour Mariana can teach them about the apartment and even offer to give them a tour of like a specific War plan or specific amenity that we deem appropriate for them Mariana can also ask for qualifying questions for that Prospect such as would you like to take an inperson tour or would you like to schedule call back all while driving engagement and increasing appointments booked now replicating that inperson tour for these apartments can drive nearly 3xd engagement and create more qualified leads for the apartment we know this because we're working with some of the largest property matters in the nation and in the spirit of the podcast we delivered our first million tours and help drive over $30 million worth of leases for the apartment additionally this has helped us get to reach over a million dollars in revenue and that's not all guys do you remember those videos that we recorded of Mariana earlier well now those are one of the biggest assets for the apartment tour automatically repurposes those videos to follow up with leads and automatically run Tik Tok meta and Google ad campaign P look Shopify has set the experience with the Advent of Shopify online shopping for everyday Commodities is compelling visual video first but larger purchases like shopping for an apartment online otherwise known as leasing still remain stuck with static photos manual scheduling and follow-ups but that ends today with tour that's right this shopping online for apartments is nearly 2x larger than all all other forms of e-commerce combined that's right guys this is the $2.5 trillion industry in which property managers rely on their tour to close over 80% of their sales we're a passionate driven team who has designed and delivered some of the best experiences the best companies in the world including growth at ramp and Google shopping we started on campus to solve our own problems and our own shopping Journey we got into YC and are just getting started with solving it for millions of more with tour the salesperson for property mat all right all right all right all right right that's pretty great so you've raised money already or what yeah we've we've raised about 350 to 400k so far but largely been boot drop we we we've had many interesting moments throughout the journey um but you know we're we're we're we've been really focused on getting the product experience as good for our customers as possible can I tell you I used to work in this industry a long time ago can I tell you like the three reasons why I think this could fail and you could you could tell me how I'm wrong uh the first I think that there was this thing called matterport that existed for a long time I know Airbnb tested it on their website and I used to be an Airbnb owner and when they had these M mport made these like realistic models of what your apartment looked like basically 3D virtual tour yeah similar to this and they found that it decreased uh conversion and the main thing being is that a lot of apartments for rent are [ __ ] and like it's like dude just like I just need to get someone in the door and once they're in the door I can like like do some salesmanship to sell them but like online it looks pretty shitty in a 3D way the the other one being that uh there's like right now I don't know do Apartments need to be filled at the moment like it seems like uh a lot of these folks are like dude I'm killing it right now my vacancy is quite low why why should I spend money or do this work um and the last one being is a lot of apartments that you need I would imagine to do sales on the apartments are kind of shitty and I don't want someone to see them online I need them to see them in real life so I can sell you on it and you know it's you know what I mean it's like I don't want like a user video of like a 1994 Honda Civic but if I get you here and you're like dude I got a$1 thousand dollar I'm like this [ __ ] box is for you and I don't need a video for that you know what I mean so can you like refute some of those points yeah I mean I think you're absolutely right mport is one of our comps you know they're doing 500 they're still doing $540 million per year they are a public comp but the big thing that they do that's different um or that we do that's different is where you're telling me that Port does 500 million in Revenue yes yes um now the big thing that is put in perspective the big thing that we do that's different is two things the first thing is we are fundamentally an active experience that's partnered with the apartment to fun funel someone down the whole sales funnel from the first moment they meet them to following up on email following up targeting that allows us to hit a large Mar much larger market than mport even does today and then the other thing that I think you talked about which is like the nature of most of these apartments you know fundamentally being not necessarily like maybe old drab experiences I think the first thing is look things change apartments are becoming one of the largest purchases we make it is one of largest purchases we make and like these are becoming more commoditized they're becoming more amenitized I mean the whole Futures is going into an experien economy and I think that experience is going to be a very important part of our our gen Z or even Millennial shop so I think that experience is a very important part we see that because a lot of our tours we we've delivered over a million tours many of them are international out of state and these are important decisions that people are on the edge on which different shops you know different shops that they or different apartments they might want to work with now for example one apartment might want to have a virtual leasing Advantage compared to others and that's why we help fun fundamentally become part that virtu leing advantage and the last element I know you want want to say something is just that we're also augmenting the sales force right so there's a Frontline sales in most of these businesses are fundamentally High churn there's people leaving the building all the time if we can help augment the sales team we have a much larger staying power with the actual property not just a one-off virtual tour and one thing I like to add is that matterport their like essential goal is to communicate the like physical establishment to the customer and obviously we do that but what we're trying to do is to augment the website to better communicate that as well as segment leads so that they know how to allocate the resources best to the highest intent leads so that's another area where they save money by better allocating resources and the tour uh the tour that you give sorry I might have missed this during the thing or like I don't know maybe have a demo is it just a girl talking and photos or is it like a walking tour that you generate or do you go film it first like what what is the actual thing okay here's the video yeah we go and film it so we have two elements we either have a video Pro Network that can help film it or we're building more and more scripts that you can easily start start filming it from your phone iPhone 16 is like Rivals like Sony cameras and then once we have gotcha so so this is not AI generated this is like a video you guys make yes yes and then we take the knowledge base as well as that median Supply that throughout the whole sales process got it okay cool so you guys uh go film a video when an apartment seal work with you and then you have the AI rapper around it where it's chat it's Q&A it's scheduling appointment it's following up with a targeted ad it's things like that that's what you guys do after that exactly okay cool and the 450 uhk of ARR that you have right now that's from how many uh customers that's from 130 property managers uh usually around the price point of $300 some are 250 some are paying more and how'd you get the 100 whatever property managers so the cool thing is we have a land and expand motion so once we're inside a property manager usually they manage many properties large apartment buildings what we do is we demonstrate our results and most of our other property management companies start expanding within the property managers so they one property manager inside a company refers us to some of her additional properties in her portfolio or some of the other Regional property managers so how will you go from 100 something properties today to you know a thousand or 10,000 in the next year what are you going to do so one of the big things we've been trying recently is automatically generating tours so that we can demonstrate value to Apartments before we even have to like go in person because obviously that's a large cost of like videotaping the actual apartment so we can immediately just scrape the website pull some images use flux to kind of turn the images into somewhat of a video pull some information from their website and generate a tour that can act to segment leads on the website and then they can kind of see the value of it oh a tour lead came in this is a high intent lead let's follow up on it and then from there if they're pleased by the value then we can actually go out and record that video making the tour even better okay so you're G to go you're GNA autogenerate these videos as a prototype as a sample and then you're going to cold email them and say hey we could do this for you guys cold email refer all yep okay and then what um do you guys run an AB test so do you you on any of your your uh apartment websites do you show if you have us installed versus if you don't have us installed what's the difference in Revenue yeah absolutely so what we notice is when it comes to the actual properties like the amount of value we generate for the properties usually additionally 300,000 to $500,000 in leases now specifically we do three things really importantly that leads that leads to like these fundament items the first thing is we deliver four times number of Tours prospects who are on the website get three times engagement and also the leads that we end up capturing just obviously are going to be more qualified right and so those leases convert at a higher rate okay gotcha that's pretty convincing if you told me hey um however many tours you're giving per week right now I could Forex that if you add this thing to your website that's a pretty compelling uh proposition don't you think Sam yes I still think that there's a bunch of the I think there's a bunch of other questions related to the things that I said but that is compelling I just I think I'm scarred from this industry of like selling to these companies and how hard it is and how old school some of these like have you guys noticed that about how old school your customers are and it's like the two customers that we've had in this presentation or in this uh section have been um campuses or colleges and apartment buildings and I'm like oh my God those are like both really really really hard um have you guys noticed that when you're selling to these apartment uh companies that they're pain in the ass to work with it it definitely is an Old Guard and and you know things change you know ever so often but I think they're realizing how important is like particularly when they're looking at like e-commerce and how things are evolving it's important for them to be extremely competitively advantaged and so just the nature of competition has really been trying to somewhat push the they're just slow they're really slow yeah yeah I do think though again back to that idea of like you want to make this feel inevitable I think it is there's a clear line you could draw where you say look if you were a apartment building and back you know 15 years ago you might have been able to get away without having a website but about 15 years ago you now had to have a website okay you had to have a website you had to be findable on Google that became mandatory table stakes and then after that you had to have photos if you didn't have photos you were you were not even competitive right you're nonviable and then you had to have videos and you had to have videos and then after that you had to have a booking thing where somebody could schedule a tour without having to call you that became table stakes and now 98% of apartment sites all have a a way to book a tour online well guess what the next one is the next one is an AI agent that's helping you book those appointments by either answering questions upselling you or you know uh putting putting together a higher quality in a pitch to get in front of you and that's the next wave of this like all websites had to go through this and when the tech made it where it was possible it just became um too competitive if you didn't have it you were left in the dust and that's what's going to happen in this space all websites are now going to have an A agent that helps them sell agreed yeah I love that show and you guys have done great with your matching zipups that are uh nicely merchandised congratulations that's that's step one to being a startup so you've nailed that one uh you've also nailed the revenue thing too so congratulations on you guys the million tours is also pretty good and $30 million of leases that came through your appointments that's that's also that's okay as well but really the jackets are fantastic all right uh thank you guys you guys are bad well thank you guys we kind of grade them on a curb it's like uh if if you're already in YC and you already have like you know a million tours done then yeah I kind of feel like these are unfair to be honest I feel like if you are in YC or taking a gap year in San Francisco um well I don't know the Gap year that's fine that's like even go to college if you're in YC well that's what I'm saying those guys put up a team slide and it was like I've experienced that good gole atelp at like all these companies like dude I thought you're supposed to be like 19 years old what's going on are these even college kids or what what's happening all right I think we have one more left the final pitch coming in from Illinois who do we got hello my name is AD gota I'm the CEO and founder of pet it's really nice to meet you guys today what's up brother nice to meet you too all right until a month ago we were working on a no code engine that helped businesses automate their daily tasks with AI and it was going really well we were working with extremely large Enterprises like the big four and had more than a million dollars in VC money to accelerate our growth but the more we work with Enterprises the more we realized that our most valuable automations for them ended up being email related they wanted help managing their cluttered inboxes that looked something like this a fun story our lead investor once told us that she went for a week-long break and had 8,000 unre emails and a business owner that we were working with told us his employees were spending more more time on emails alone than the job they were actually hired to do and these stories are not one-offs according to McKenzie the average employee processes more than 600 emails per week wasting 13 hours and thousands of business dollars despite it being an essential part of our Lives email has become a burden and we find it hard to keep track of even the most important emails in our inbox often losing them but according to Industry select 86% of business professionals still prefer using emails for some reason so clearly we can't get rid of emails so what can we do well to solve this exact problem we are currently building a virtual executive assistant or secretary that handles your emails for you what if just like a real secretary it could learn from you and respond to emails on your behalf what if just like a real secretary it tells you what the most important emails in your inbox are every single morning and what if just like a real secretary it could automatically respond to emails that you don't care about well you can have that secretary because our mobile app does all of that and we are launching on the App Store next week and no we're not joking we have been actively working with a big four customer netting us six figures in annual revenue and are starting a pilot with the largest children's enrichment franchise in the world next week not only that but we have also been working with five Global financial institutions and completed and over subscribed seven figure Rays we were also fortunate enough to win first place in one of midwest's largest startup pitch competitions my name is adva and together with my co-founder Mark we collectively bring more than a decade of experience in Ai and building companies my entire teenage years have been spent building and scaling numerous online security businesses to millions of users and Mark has tons of AI research and startup experience under his belt we're now working together to change the way you interact with email today so join us in helping you reclaim the biggest part of your daily workday thank you so hold on you the first five set words of your pitch was pretty funny you said until last month we were doing this thing so let me answer some questions and then but then you have a a a sixf fig Enterprise contract and you've raised a million dollars I I don't understand can you like briefly tell me the they had a product they're pivoting they raised money they had a customer but it wasn't the thing so they're pivoting yeah is that right is that yes for sure so I can answer that question um so essentially we have it's it's the same business so we have a we worked on the generative engine um generative AI engine that we started just this February so all the contracts that we have are now converting to the email client essentially we were using our technology to develop email automations for all these businesses and we had raised money on that but now we simply changed the user interface from a workflow Builder that looked kind of like zapier Etc to more of an assistant email client interface that we found that it works better with Enterprise um customers got it all right because your website doesn't tell that story but um then if you click you have this uh folder up top that says new exclamation point our email client which is pretty cool uh that tells that story a little bit better can PSA about the uh our team has Decades of experience oh my gosh I didn't want to get on thatch but yeah yeah I guess got say because a couple of a couple of the pitches have had that um I don't think you should do that uh it it seems you know what you really want in a pitch is to give the vibe to the investor that wait a minute I think this is even bigger than what they're saying so there's this subtle art where you're you're desperately trying to convince them that this is going to be big and awesome and it's going to work but you cannot appear to be um overselling it you have to feel like you're under selling it and then they feel like they're finding some diamond in the rough and so you know how old are you I'm 20 you're 20 right so to be like we have you know a combined 12 years of experience I think that's a bit of a tell what you what you would be better off saying is I started coding when I was eight by the time I was 12 I had already built blah blah blah and when I was 14 I hacked into my schools thing and changed my grades and now I've figured out you know the you know for the last few years I've really been obsessed and focused with the AI and like that's a more believable and exciting story for me is like this is one of those boy Geniuses right like oh you're one of those like hacker types that started early I can pattern match and say yeah a lot of the best performing Founders I know have that same story and that story works better versus when you tell me you know me and my co-founder who are you know 18 years old we've got Decades of experience it's like no you don't right okay now what else can't I believe out of this even if it's technically true the whole like cumulative years of experience of your team is not a real metric that most people put in their pitch deck so I would I would get rid of that yes right having said that all right that's Public Service Announcement I do have a question it seems like you've done a great job of selling into people that are really hard to sell into so how did you go get a Enterprise contract from a big four consulting company worth you know over $100,000 I'm curious to hear what you did there what's the short story yeah very good question so um short story was that I was working as a consultant um on campus as part of a university organization and thanks to my opportunity there I was able to connect to a very high level business executive within a big four Enterprise um through my mentor who happened to also be the director of the consulting or so long story short it was very Network driven um they were looking for a solution to fit certain problems that they had within an Enterprise and what I was building as a personal project happened to solve those exact problems so once I had that we essentially made it a company and what did they say when you're pivoting I mean did you pivot because of them they are partly the reason we pivoted but it was also when we started engaging with more and more prospects so our initial generative AI workflow engine was essentially you could take Ai and plug it into any Legacy systems to automate any complex day-to-day task for example if you're a VC and you receive a lot of pitch decks every day via email we could create an automation for you where you would automatically um process those pitch decks analyze them against your investment thesis portfolio companies Etc and then also send out replies saying hey we love this we would love to have a or no for the following reasons and what you're describing is that sorry I want you to finish but is what you're describing similar to Lindy yes so ly. a was definitely a competitor of ours in that space um but then as I was saying earlier the more we engaged with customers and Prospects we found that our product was explicitly being used for email automations and a big problem with products like our previous one and Lindy AI is that the barrier to entry for a lot of non-technical users is quite High you have to almost be a developer to actually use even these no code tools and that is why we decided to change the interface into a much easier to understand virtual assistant or secretary gotcha I think the challenge with this business because you seem really smart and uh you know I think whatever you work on will be you know interesting I think the challenge here is you're going into the most competitive space so I do feel undoubtedly that email inboxes are going to start to have ai in them and the AI is going to help you process categorize um summarize your emails in a in a way and respon help you with the responses the problem is do I really believe that you are going to be able to get people off of Outlook off of Gmail and onto your service or in addition you know they're also going to be doing that right Google Google's definitely going to be adding AI into this and so is superhuman and so is Microsoft right they own open AI basically and so I do think that this is going to be just an absolute bloodbath category and so I think from an investment point VI that would be my problem with this which is even if I like you and even if I agree with the idea it's kind of that second inevitability I talked about one is where's is the puck going this way there's yes of course it's going this way the second is are you going to be the team who captures that opportunity and it just seems highly unlikely that you would be the team that captures that opportunity given people don't want to switch email clients and that all of the email clients are already aware of this uh you know capability and are you know highly incentivized to add AI to it how did you say how much you raised so far you said a million yes we have raised a little more than a million are you still in school or are you living in San Francisco um currently we're on a gap semester like I'm on a gap semester everyone else on the Mark's also on a gap semester he has one class left but everyone else is full-time we have four people dude I think like that first company meet your class uh it's that middle funnel things that that's the issue all these kids all these smart kids are bailing on University that's amazing that you guys are all just like picking gaps um so well I just told you that uh you're probably going to fail tell me why I'm wrong and I should kick rock yeah for sure um so business is switching to our email client is definitely a very big hurdle that we were also trying to navigate but what we found is um by verticalized businesses with our own kind of information management secretary um a lot of businesses prefer us over their standard email clients like Gmail and outlook for example um currently as I said we're starting a pilot with the largest children's enrichment franchise they entirely run over Gmail but they're still willing to switch to us simply because some of the features that we provide is something Gmail and Outlook just can never do because they have to cater to large groups of audiences and they cannot fit specific niches of um certain requirements that a lot of customers have okay uh all right fair enough um Sam what else you got before we wrap up I don't think I have much I I think that um I think that it's so early it's hard to ask questions because I'm on your website and it looks like it's very much beta so it's hard for me to fully understand I think Sean you were asking about replacing Gmail according to the website it's an integration it's not replacing Gmail it's hard to fully understand because you're so new do you agree do do you just keep using Gmail and this is overlaid or um is this a new client you download and you're supposed to go here instead of gmail.com yes so essentially you just log in with your Gmail so one way we're beating that barrier to adoption is by not saying that you need a new TLD and a new domain ID you simply log in with your Gmail we get all your emails and then you start using our interface rather than Gils yeah it's like superum right so you keep your email address but fundamentally you're not supposed to you know you're not supposed to go to Gmail every day you're supposed to go to superhuman and and open up your email and use your use that for all your emails yes that is correct all right uh good pitch thank you best of luck you uh I think I think this is a huge idea I think it's gonna be super competitive and if you did it that would be amazing this is a this is a multi-billion dollar win if you can actually do it that's the good news yeah thank you all right round of applause thanks brother all right to wrap it can we just name I think do you guys want to do the winning school that we thought brought the brought the heat um secondly our favorite pitch the best pitch meaning the one we would be most likely to put our money into and then the um I think we should maybe do a audience Choice as well which is uh you know let the crowd react and see which one they they think is best what do you think Sam all right so let's start with school I have a winner let's recap real quick Michigan did meet your class um which was helping universities with the summer melt middle funnel for University milu which is the personalized skincare microbiome stuff and tour which was the AI apartment tours and then UIUC was basically me metapo which is the dubbing company Brothers nuts which is the sprouted Nuts Company and pathet that one we just heard about email the AI email client so those are the schools Sam what's your pick Illinois all the way uh I think that Michigan's an incredibly impressive school but I think that um I thought that uh I thought it I thought it was incredibly impressive that the meta frazo guy was at um uh was that Founders or what's it called the the um the way this young guy who just went the way that he had already raised a little bit of money um and was taking a gap year and then Brothers nuts already has a business that has is doing like 400 a year in Revenue I just thought it was more impressive that a Midwestern School their people are like going to the coast and I think that's a really good thing do you agree or no I would disagree I would have gone Michigan I think that traction wise I mean poor let's make the case here tour had the most traction right uh half a million dollars in ARR a million in tour served uh I think tour and they're NYC I think tour was doing the best uh I think meet your class has a real business I think he stumbled into kind of actually like a cool business where half a million people have used this thing and now we found a business model that might actually work so I thought that um Michigan had had the better businesses overall all right good they each they they each get a vote but we disagree and it's a tie um all right so let's do our favorite business out of these if you were going to invest your money into one of these Sam which one would you have invested your money into the business that I don't want to invest in but I wish I owned and I think the people should uh the people who own this one might get the richest uh the fastest of all these businesses is brother nuts I think Austin major brother nuts I don't think they should raise money I don't want to invest in them but I would love to own that company I think it could be a family business that makes hundreds or hundreds of millions or even more throughout the next handful of decades okay I like it my head my head tells me it's either me your class or tour but my heart is with Brothers nuts and I'm going to go with Brothers nuts as well I think that they are one uh you know one step away from actually making this like a real a legit business that you're going to see on the shelves in every grocery store I think they're not far away from doing that and I actually think it's a it's I would I would actually invest in this business because I think you could actually make it happen it's not uh it's it's not theoretical here I think that all the most of the companies had an AI element and I applaud that I think that's where that's where the Puck's going but it's hard to stick out man like we get I there's just so much going on one with an almond element yeah an almond element uh I don't know man right doesn't it seem it kind of seems like it's TBD as to like who's going to be the winners it seems really hard to to to pick a winner at the moment yeah it's a tra a trade-off of like more competition but maybe more upside well you said it well you said um you said um this is definitely what's going to happen but it's gonna be a blood bath yeah and and that's how I feel so now the crowd's choice so can you guys unmute I'm gonna say the name of the uh of the business crowd reaction is going to dictate who wins the the audience Choice let's see if this works I just might be crazy with with the audio situation here our producers is freaking out all yeah turn turn the laptops let's I want to see the crowd actually okay so we got the crowd yeah all right we're going to start off from Michigan meet your [Applause] class okay from from UI metapa all right they might just be closer to the microphone we'll give them credit for that all right uh from Michigan again we have the skin microbiome company [Applause] milu uh see is definitely putting his mouth next to the mic all right um we're gonna go from uiu we have pathet lukewarm lukewarm I'm going to call it what it was um from Michigan we have tour [Applause] all right so from Michigan it looks like milu was the loudest and now from UI last one we have brothers nuts so Sean I'm I I think I know who won that one I think it was the metapo Meto I think had it I think they had it yeah we miss you bro we miss you all right all right okay wonderful guys great job uh everybody this is really impressive you guys are way ahead of where I was in college I think Sam probably the same for you you guys are ahead of the curve I hope our feedback is helpful even the people we [ __ ] on like if we ask hard questions or or give you a hard time I every of all the six people who presented the six companies you're going to be in the 1% of the 1% you already are in the 1% of the 1% and what you're doing is badass by being active you're badass and it's a sign of respect if we are willing to get keep it real with you that's because we actually think think that you can win if we just wanted to be nice and say oh Cong participation I'm so you know so happy for you um you know that wouldn't have been helpful to you but it also would be actually you know not a sign of respect we we we respect all of you for doing this and I just want to say like I would not have become an entrepreneur had I not had a class like this uh where a speaker came in and just got me hyped about the idea of doing a startup I did not know what to do my first idea was terrible my execution was absolutely horrendous but it got me on that it just seemed like more fun and so if you're listening to this or you're at one of these schools right now um if it seems like something that you would want to do and it seems like the lifestyle like go for it you know uh you know don't let that hold you back this could be a Tipping Point moment for you just like it was for me and it's the the you are currently in the phase of life where it will never get easier to do these things than where you are right now uh for the next like you have like a 4year window where it's like you have nothing really big to worry about except for this and also uh I think it's Austin and Tommy give these guys a shout out uh you guys are the [Applause] man um it's really hard to organize this type of stuff and I think that uh getting getting this type of energy in one room like you guys have done it's contagious s you thinking what I'm thinking got two words for you I got two words for you Nationwide we're taking the Power Hour Nationwide uh and then the second the second two words for you pizza party sponsored by MFM I think we should give these guys some money let them uh host some events and have some fun uh so we will we will we'll connect with you Tommy after this and we we'll give you guys some cash so that we can H you know encourage you to throw more events and get more people excited about this and I like that it's underground I like that it's off the books I like that this is not the entrepreneurship Club of the school this is um you know just the people who actually you know care about building stuff and want to do cool things and want to get off the itional career track um I I I'm for that thank you all for doing this we appreciate you have a wonderful Wednesday and uh if you're listening on MFM you got to go and give all these guys a little bit of love on on their websites and and check out their products all right thank you guys that's it that's the [Music] pod for

and at the time my email was Christina us.com and like the right side that USV docomo that and like what do you think will happen [Music] here um do you know what you Katie Perry and serender Williams have in common I've got nothing you're all on the four selfmade women I ha that list and you are ahead of them isn't that kind of amazing would preferred that list never existed yes you have the Midwest modesty yes you're nothing good will come from that list yeah yeah those lists are um they're sort of made for the wrong type of people yes um or jail time later or something a while laugh that it was never on 30 under 30 and I'm like deeply glad about that now yeah that turned out to be an anti- signal you know when I was thinking about this episode uh the way I think about it is like where you today is where a lot of people want to be you have a company that's working it's got like a cool startup name it's got a cool office in San Francisco last valuation I believe 2.45 billion but who's counting today you're at where a lot of people want to be but if we rewind the tape to me when I looked at your story I think the through line for this is not counting yourself out so I'm going to put that out there that might be true or might not be true but the the basics of it is you you had a good job and you quit to try something new to try to make it on your own which a lot of people want to do but they don't take the leap you took the leap and it's not like it hit right away and you created vanta and you created this you know multi-billion dollar company right off the bat you did like 35 things wrong uh or 35 projects that went nowhere and I love that because I spent eight years of my life banging my head against the wall with failure after failure after failure each time believing this is the time I you know let's start where you have a good job yeah um you have the job at you which I think you kind of hustled your way into I would say stum stumble hustled didn't like they announced that job like they do all their jobs on the internet and said hey fill out this form if you want this job send us some links to your web pres and so I literally sent them Three Links of to my web presence and didn't email anyone who knew them didn't you know turned out I like knew people from school who knew didn't didn't pull anything just sent them links and put them in a form and was like well now I'll go back to making slides what kind of links it was Twitter flicker see the era of this and I had started a design blog in a couple months before and I lived in Berlin because I wanted to be like a designer who lives in Berlin and those people seem to have design blogs so I started one and that was it and they hired me which is crazy and I read something that was like they maybe Fred or somebody at the USB team was telling you you should specialize in crypto you should become a crypto VC is that true kind of it actually when I was leaving so this was end of 2012 I had a lot of angst because his job was great they were great you know like haven't you made it and I sort of like H but I don't think I like it and again what what's what's going on and one of my Hang-Ups was uh you know what have I done why would anyone take my money right who's going to take a check from me versus in my head at the time Matt ker this uh GPU is no longer at been Mark but had this like illustrious Silicon Valley Career of like LinkedIn Facebook Benchmark you know you're like me's mcer everyone will choose mcer like 100 out of 100 times which is let's say maybe a part partially imposter syndrome but also maybe hyper logical also I think like yeah but like also true anyway and I I basically said that their friend he said two things which or he said a couple things out uh deeply insightful one was like well you know one Chistina you've got to like get over that and you can either get over that by sort of out hustling people and like kind of the Fig it till you make it strategy and you're sort of like look I've seen you in the office for 2 years worked with you for two years like you're not you're not going to be going to so you probably shouldn't try that one the other strategy is pick something go deep in it and be the expert where no one else is and in the fall of 2012 I recommend you choose crypto really good advice on a bunch of Dimensions I didn't take it but like because you didn't believe in crypto or you were just like that's not me I'm just like I don't know if I want to be an investor okay even though it's great and it's wonderful and all these great attributes and like everyone else wants to be a VC but like I want to go make things so you decided to go make things take me back to that decision was that easy no I was so Ang was everybody patting on the back and saying you're going to make this happen definitely not what I did what my plan was was I'd save my bonus from the prior year and it's was kind of like a finan bonus and I was going to live off of that as long as I could so like no job but a bunch of structure learned a code learn to make products hopefully something would come out of that and very much pitched as that it was not pitched as I am going to start a startup it was pitches I'm going to teach myself to code cuz that's how I saw it and thought about it and like yes I wanted to start a startup but I'd seen over the two years at USV so many people start startups to start them and then get into them and then be like I don't want to work on this but now I have people in office investor like I can't stop but I think there was uh I think people took that conservatism as oh you shouldn't be doing this and so specific there was a I mean there was a bunch of like why no one leaves USV who has the option of staying why would you do that or don't you want to work at some other Venture firm or oh you want a code why don't you go to grad school Stanford has a great graduate programming computer science why don't you go work for somebody else because clearly you you don't know what you want to do and then some amount of like kind of the tougher stuff I think where one person in particular had been close to and who was very like just the left side and the right side of your email address and at the time my email was Christina usvc like the right side that usb.com is way more powerful than the left side and now you are giving that up and so what are you you're betting on the left side you're betting on the left side and like why would you do that and like what do you think will happen here so you have the good job yep you quit you hear the look you took the rights out of the email which was the powerful part you threw it away you're betting on the Christina part of which there are many many and your plan is not even to go start a company it's to learn how to code and you're going to teach yourself how to code by going on online and learning how to code that way and my understanding is that worked uh because I went to your website well you have this like list of projects like I built all these things yeah none of which you've heard of yeah mostly went nowhere there's something romantic about that too like I'm going to go in a cave and I'm going to reinvent myself and learn this magic superpower and I'm going to train in the mountains where nobody's looking and then I'm going to come back stronger yep it may not have felt that way at the time it like I kind of knew it was supposed to feel that way and then day to day there was some men of like I spent more than my like daily cash allow you know but like I kind of knew that's what I a better version of me would feel but practically I knew I was a person who benefits from structure and isn't always great at at doing for myself so what I did was a friend of mine had just sold a company to eBay New York and opened up this this big space in New York that was actually right across the street from the USV office and so I got up every day and I got dress for my job and I basically walked to the same place but I went in a different door and then I sat with those engineers and they dress up by the way cuz I feel like there's psychologically something to actually dressing up like you're going somewhere I te dress up but it was like I did not wear pajamas like um yeah yeah and then i' go and I'd you know show up in the morning and I'd like do my audacity tutorial or try to understand Jano JavaScript to to varying degrees and then like go home at you know 6: p.m. or 7 p.m. and then often like keep doing stuff but basically was like tricking myself into acting like I had a job so that I got up every day I was there by 9:30 you know I was just doing the things and I and I do remember there was a time my family took a vacation that I went along with in January and I came back tan and everyone was like where were you last week like basically like why weren't you at work and why are you T and I be like I compain for this like Al everything is PTO to me um but it was like also like oh yeah I got this like that's that was kind of like a fun fun moment too yeah I like that so you have this era which is kind of like in the movies it's the Montage it's they just fast forward through this part takes 2 minutes even though in real life it's 2 years and you have this thing written on your site that I love this quote and I think in my research this was my favorite thing I pulled from you which was at the top of your site it says the function of the overwhelming majority of your artwork is simply to teach you how to make the small fraction of your artwork that Soares and this is from a book called The Art of Fear Can you I love that can you can you explain that yeah I think it's deeply true of creative projects and I think startups or businesses or you know internet art is like they're all creative projects one thing I learned at USV seeing seeing people [ __ ] but then like hearing the stories behind their big you know Tumblr Twitter Force quer whatever all the big successes of the era were when I walked into USV I was like everyone is Mark Zuckerberg not actually But like everyone you know like startup Founders are people who have an idea vision and they go into their room and they build it and everyone uses it and it's like the first or second thing they've done and like Facebook picker but I was kind of all of Mark's projects and so like that's the way you know and like I like shoot I'm like not it's never worked for me so I'm I'm probably not one of them and USB was just so helpful in disabusing that notion and being like look some PE like a very small number of people can do that and that's incredible I wish I were them I'm not most people actually try a bunch of stuff and eventually something might work but it's like at Best Thing five and it might be thing 55 but no one really talks about that CU it's both because it's like painful and kind of not fun and you know it's supposed to be romantic but actually just kind of sucked and like hungry for two years literally and and metaphorically and it's so much nicer like you get so much more praise for sort of being like the brilliant person right and that's the expectation too I think I just had a like well yeah but like that's discouraging so many people from starting it's sort of like when you watch a bunch of movies about love and then you're like this is what it's like I will bump into a stranger our papers will fall on the floor we'll swap a paper swap a paper he'll have to come find me but then I'm not into him but he just pursues me anyways and it's like if you have that notion that that's how it goes you'll almost count yourself out of other things that could have worked otherwise that you know if you watch The Social Network you're like that's just how it is brilliant genius has has a vision does it takes off and then he rides that bull uh at the rodeo all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we called it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode we actually after I read this quote on my team we started using this phrase just called bad art so I'll hit up my team in the morning I'll say hey let's make some bad art like intentionally just almost lower the stakes instead of we have to find the next big winner idea right let's just make some bad art today and the analogy I gave them I said imagine like you know you go to a hotel or a motel you're doing something you're going to a place that you've never been before maybe nobody's been there before when you turn on the tap like it's muddy water at the beginning yep and if you look at that and you're it's like you're mortified by it it's disgusting you turn it off right away and be like ew bad right Lea but if you know that actually that's the process that you sort of have this muddy water of bad ideas and bad skills at the beginning get it out of your system then suddenly the water starts running clean and I think that framework is is just very useful for anyone who's doing either creative Endeavors or startups which are a pretty creative Endeavor too do you know the story about making pots no from the same book so uh and I think it was like around the chapter that quote was but anyway there was an art teacher and he said okay Art School pottery class you have one assignment all semester you have five weeks to make the perfect pot you can turn in as many pots as you want but I will judge them all and the highest grade will go to the person who has the best pot and student one spends all semester crafting the perfect pot and hands it in at the end and student two makes two pots a day and they're all bad for a long time right but over the course of semester it hands in whatever like 300 pots and like who gets a better grade of course 300 right yeah yeah but it's like that concept it's like so true you have to live it almost to really internalize it actually a great um thing I did once with my company there's uh you've probably seen like the marshmallow test like the psych test with kids it makes a good point which is you give a bunch of supplies to uh you break your team into a bunch of groups groups of maybe four or five and they get like sticks of spaghetti one marshmallow and there's something like uh maybe a string and like two other things like a piece of tape and so the idea is hey uh you have an hour at the end of the hour I will come around I will measure whoever from the tabletop has the highest marshmallow so whoever could build the biggest tower wins and what most people do what my team did and everybody who does this the first time pretty much is you immediately go into like the way we do most things in corporate life so it's kind of like okay uh you're in charge you do this you sort of segregation of Duties you start trying to like plan and then you so you sketch a little bit then you start building the tower and at the very end you're like okay okay it's almost time put the marshmallow on and the entire thing collapses because even though a marshmallow looks so small and like light compared to Spaghetti sticks it's way too heavy and you don't realize that cuz you didn't like you like backloaded the possible failure you know the the failure mode or or the sort of test of the of the idea uh you spend all your time kind of planning and architecting This brilliant beautiful thing and the the cool thing that they've shown in this is that when they do it with kids versus adults the kids right away either eat the marshmallow or put the marshmallow on right away and they're like oh it's too heavy you have to have like five spaghetti sticks to hold this thing up they figure that out right away they don't kind of save that to the end to try to perfect it Y and that sort of iterative thing about testing the riskiest assumption is is maybe important it seems like for you did you make that mistake of kind of like overanalyzing over planning at the beginning like not testing with customers less the very beginning because at the beginning I was just buil I built a book website it was like good reads but better but it was actually worse because I didn't know what I was doing and but like it was something for me um this confused everyone else right right cuz they'd be like well you're well not you know what are you doing without having a job and I'm like I'm building a book website and they'd be like are you going to comp with Amazon no like are you going to be with good reads and you're like well you know with my with my friends but like no you know and then they'd be like well what would you say you're doing you know and you're like mostly battling JavaScript errors trying to and like spending a lot of time on stack Overflow you know but anyways it's like whole confusing thing but the beginning it was just I like like when I would go visit a friend's apartment I'd always like be drawn to their bookshelf you want to see what's on their bookshelf anyway so he was like okay what if I can get every these books online but he was like clearly this is not a business like best case I'm making like 50 bucks a month you know Amazon referral fees like not a business but you did it anyways why because I wanted it I want and it was a good it wasn't you know like you do their initial coding tutorials and you like are making whatever the other person wants to make which is not what you want to make and like I actually wanted this thing and it like forced me to be like oh you know now I want like animation when you shove the book so you right and then you'd like learn about CSS animation whatever it is and so you so you started building stuff for yourself y did you ever switch gears to okay now now I'm going to do the startup startup I'm going to do the thing that might actually you know get me out of poverty like self-induced poverty basically so at that point I was very like look I you know just taught myself how to code and like you know am I that good no but learning how to do some of this is much harder than it should be and a lot of it's because our programming tools make us like hold everything in our heads and you have to teach yourself to think like a computer and like read through code just like not how a person you know think like a computer and once you have that everything gets easier but like why we are typing on computers and so I kind of got on this like uh if we could make our programming environments better you can like more they will just make more sense and more people will like learn to code and so you know I was really into that personal problem also the like you know live in the future and build back you know whatever all the all the startup Trope advice I'm curious about that what startup Trope advice actually helped you I think the build something you want is a bit of a red herring it works in some cases but you're also very limited to your experience it's kind of like when they tell writers write what you know and then you like you know it's like a 14-year-old who's had Charmed Life and like they just don't know that much and so like what are they going to write about um and so uh my version of that is like look if there is something personally meaningful like by all means go for it that's top ranked totally but like second best is like find someone else with the problem and deeply deeply understand them uh I think there's a the shut your eyes imagine the future what's it look like build that I think this makes sense in retrospect I think in the moment it's pretty hard to generate reasonable startup ideas doing that right but I can tell you a story about V where vanta fits that and it does but it's but that's in retrospect yeah so what was the actual in the moment way that you stumbled into this idea of vant that now seems obvious as all great ideas do once once they exist now there's you guys and some competitors trying to do the same thing but that was kind of a novel idea and it was a new part of the market at least yep what was the insight for that the Insight was wanted to start a security company that started serving startups there seemed to be like security was this huge Market but no one was really focused on startups and startups didn't use security tools and I sort like why and like when does this become a 90 quadrillion like go from a zero Tam to like 90 quadrillion dollar market size in precise terms yeah that's the official number yeah exactly um but wait why security because like you know when I'm talk I've been talking to you for I don't know 20 minutes now you don't strike me as somebody who's like I wake up every morning and I was thinking about security during that year off what why did you even think about security to begin with um it seemed really interesting it seemed like this kind of competitive cat and mouse thing where they uh with attackers where there's like kind of a real dashboard right I think one of the things I've I mean I guess I knew but I didn't really know like I'm very competitive should have played more Sports as a kid didn't uh through van to have an outlet for a lot of that energy which is great and I think honestly when I was at Dropbox I worked with this product security team and they were great they were super fun and they were really good Educators and it's not like they hosted you know seminars on things it's just like they wanted you to fix something but they'd come over and sit next to you and explain why it was important and how and all the anyway they were just great and so in coming up with startup ideas there was a bit of like well this actually seems like a deep enough interesting enough space that if I work in it for years there'll be lots of things and if I can't come up with anything and end up burning you know 18 months of my life learning about Security on the internet could have been worse yeah right like you kind of look back and be like okay worst case nothing comes out of this but like I you know I'll feel as good as I will or the dots for me so you you took the year or multiple years off to teach yourself two years yeah but then you go to Dropbox yeah so you go back to getting a job yeah so I feel like we like there's a part of the story that's like I iterate finally I found it no no no finally you found a job at Dropbox yeah cuz I was kind of like okay now I can code but I've never had a real job I've never worked at a company I've never worked with people also my my like friends are kind of getting promoted and like I can you know like it's unclear if I'm employable you know like this seems bad and I was really frustrated cuz again like I wouldn't tell people I wanted a startup to come out of that but like I did but I also at the time was like well nothing I worked on should be a start up right so so what was that story you told yourself so you you spent the two years you bet on yourself yep which sounds amazing that's a great t-shirt bet on yourself but the reality of I do it for I told you I did it for eight years and I was delusional enough to keep going yeah but also objectively it was bad and I should have I had to tell myself certain stories in order to either keep going or to like just maintain a self of a sense of confidence beyond that because the evidence was telling me you yeah and I just couldn't tell myself you suck cuz then I definitely suck yeah what were you saying when the evidence kind of said you suck this is very silly I had this like survey I would fill out a Google form I'd fill out for myself every Sunday or every weekend what are you working on how do you feel about it what are you going to like what's your next goal what are you going to do to move forward you made that for yourself made it for myself it was like a personal accountability thing right okay and I asked a bunch of questions they were all useless the only question that ended up mattering was is what would make you stop working on what you're working on right now and to your point turns out my present self always thinks I should keep going but my past self sometimes things current self should stop right and so I was actually like looking at those answers and being like two months ago I should said I should stop if I got to the the point I'm at now I don't actually think I have counterveiling evidence I just have stubbornness shoot I should probably stop and so that's how you were stopping those projects um you when when we I sent you some questions ahead of this to try to understand what what you think is important to talk about what do you think is insightful you said something that I really resonate with which is managing your own mind uh managing your own psychology is one of the most important things yep um how does one do that and what's like how would you teach that to somebody else or how would you talk about that to somebody else it's I think hard hard to do hard to teach um I think what I try to tell people is figure out what like it's it's personal and not personal sensitive but like personal like specific to you and figure out what makes you happy or centered whatever those things are and like do not give them up and so for me for years it was like a you know running three or four times a week and like exercise sure but it was actually just like the Mind clearing catharsis kind of meditative like running and you know it's like running for me but like whatever for someone else and it's like whatever that thing is do not give it up and I don't care how busy you get but sort of know what makes you feel like you and don't drop those things know what things make you feel like you which is kind of like what you're talking about his habits and hobbies is that more of what you're think about just like that feeling where you like you're you're like moving through the world and you like feel like you're at your best you know like you're the best shinest version of yourself it's like what brings that on so for you running is one what else running is one reading like not in any I mean kind of an elegant intellectual way but actually just because it is something I have done since I was 6 years old right and so like if I think of like Hobbies or anything I've done through my life reading is actually one of the biggest through lines right and so there's a part of that that just feels like me yeah cuz I was looking you read like I don't know like 30 50 books a year or something yeah but it's it's like I mean yes I want to learn things and like blah blah blah but actually it's just like it is centering how do you do that when I was running a company and and by the way mine was not a 2.4 billion company I was like I have no time to read are you kidding me there's problems everywhere I'm drowning in problems and did you just replace TV with reading or something as simple as that yeah like actually Eric told me that you are like extremely quick with reading he's like she would take a bus to work yeah and read the BS and read the whole book on the bus ride yeah I mean over the course of a week or so but yeah like uh actually to this day the way he said it was more legendary he was like two and from cover to cover no that wasn't it I actually still take a bus to work part of it so I can just sit there and like you bus to work yeah cuz look if I take a car I'm just going to like sit in the back with my laptop writing emails you know uh and in a bus like I want San Francisco bus I'm not pulling on my laptop on that unless something's like really gone wrong um and so it just forces me to like sit there and have 20 minutes between home and work um and I like that much more you know people are like obsessed with cold plunges I think the more hardcore version is take a San Francisco plus to work it's like wow you can dur a 18-minute bus ride with like the buses aren't bad 5 Hour used to be my bus 5 hour is are great I used to take the 38 and 38 is like an actual Zoo it's like anything can happen yeah yeah yeah no five hours Great bus I miss it I miss it okay so um so Bing psychology you said uh figure out what makes you feel like you most you and make sure you stick with those things keep doing those things it'll kind of keep you you centered with it what about manage your own psychology when it comes to self-doubt when it comes to getting down on yourself cuz I spent two years I didn't really land where I wanted to land with it did you have a conversation with yourself there or a story you told yourself in order to to yeah I was so annoyed I was which in retrospect I was like being so pretentious like life was good you know again like the the bat like my worst case outcome was becoming a product manager at dropboxes height of dropboxes power like my life was great did you just say the batna yeah right but like my life was great it did not feel great at the time it was totally great and again I knew I was like 5% aware of that 10% but that was not the lived feeling do you use negotiation terms like that just regularly hopefully not that sounds kind of obnoxious I'll try not to now no I like that and um I've always felt that if you build a great Sil Valley company internally in your company you should be a totally normal person but outside you should have that like 10% crazy yeah it just gives you like actually 2x evaluation it just creates this extra Aura true wow she's she's Barefoot all the time why oh interesting she must be one of those real outlier types oh my gosh all right I want to ask you about this list of ideas that you did so I've looked back in my career and even when I went through eras where I tried something and it didn't work a lot of the times I look back with the benefit of hindsight now and I think oh I was just sort of an idiot about it had I actually either stuck with it or done it differently or pivoted the market that actually was a good idea I'm curious do you feel that way about any of the projects you worked on um like there art projects and I say that with deep love but like they're not businesses okay um The Voice Assistant for biologist that doesn't sound like a great buiness that that was just comically bad no yeah there's like a deep lack of any commercials in nearly everything on that list which I think is part of why vanta has had commercials like baked in from the very beginning CU I'd made that mistake so many times what about now so if you if you weren't doing this or in general like when you operate a business you see a bunch of pain points blind spots uh maybe like parts of the market that are addressed if somebody's listening to this right now and they are looking for you know inspiration or ideas that you know spark thoughts in their head about stuff that they could go do where would you look what would you recommend people think about what problems do you think need solving yeah I think so so much of what I think about that's not kind of directly inv vanted wheelhouse is something around like running a B2B sest or being in a B2B sast business forget running it just being in it there's like so like someone please fix the go to market a tooling stack there's 9,000 tools and none of and it's like you Jerry them together and this rub Goldberg machine and the marbles are all over on the floor and like anyone wants to BB sass just like fix that go full stack on all that but for people who don't want BB sass of which there are hopefully many I think the process vant came out of I mean I of course like I mean I liked it going in but now of course I really like it but that was pick something you want to learn about and just go talk to anyone you can about like what their days are like their problems are like just like what's going on and kind of try to develop a mental model of the space the story I heard about vant which sometimes we make up these retrospect stories so I I don't know you tell you can I try to actually tell the the true one like blink twice if it's true but it was you're at Dropbox you work on this thing called paper which was this I remember like seeing paper at the time was like this idea of this like collaboration tool and you go Google Docs yeah Dropbox is Google Docs you go to launch it and it's like hey we don't have stock 2 so can't really launch or customers can't use it and you were like sock what yep and you didn't know really what that was and you were like so how do we get that and you started asking questions to try to understand like what is this thing that blocked us here if it blocked us maybe it blocks other people yep Dropbox had a security team that was going to be able to try to solve those problems but like the average startup doesn't yep and the next part of the story that I liked was even though you had just spent two years learning to code and built 35 projects and coded them up and shipped them out there whatever ever you didn't write code for this you were like I'm going to test this idea with an Excel spreadsheet only Y and you went to one or two startups I think YC startups that you thought might need this and you were like hey if I did this for you would that be valuable and they're like ah yeah sure can you how much of that is true all true um the stylized part is all that Dropbox stuff happened there was no light bulb I was like not smart enough to have a light bulb go over my head at the end I wish so but it was just like learned about the whole process learned what it would take and then like basically ran screen from the room cuz it just sounded awful especially when we were trying to launch and even figure out if we had product Market fit so the idea of like we're going to go two years of work to then see if we have product Mark fit you're like bad bad like how do I find reality faster came back to it later did the spreadsheet thing and I think honestly it's like cuz there's 35 things on the list like it's kind of at the point where you're like okay I can write you know maybe someone shoty JV but like I can code the thing or code a first version of the thing that's not the hard part the hard part is does anyone want my thing at the end and so like how much of the validation can you frontload there so I I think a lot of people hear that and like they hear you should talk to customers you should validate if people want this make something people want y I don't think anyone has any idea how to actually do it so what is the quick and dirty recipe for how you actually go who do you talk to what do you really ask them how do you make sure you're not getting these false positives just by being like Eager Beaver and they're like yeah that would be maybe I'd be interested um and you're like they totally loved it yeah so um on the false positives anything that is not can you do this for me now tomorrow next week is a no and people are really kind and they want to be kind and so they don't say like rarely do they say no but a lot of like oh maybe next quarter like I don't need this but my friend might hard know you should date my friend hard know totally hard knows um I think on who to talk to I mean look we started with like anyone who would talk to us and then it was just like and then so it ended up being co-workers former co-workers cuz you had like some like well I don't know if you know anything about this topic but you're kind of a nicest person and so I'll like give you a half an hour sort of thing and then just fan out from there at the end when they're like well you know you ask them do you have anybody else and they would list people and like say yes follow up with customized email they could forward you know like make it easy for them and just keep going out yeah I think that's an important one make it easy for them yes to do the thing they said they want to do oh yeah like follow up and be like thanks so much for meeting me like I would love to talk to your friend who who said this like here's what I'm working on like and just like assume they will like write them in email they will forward exactly yeah so you um have you ever read this thing called the mom test yes uh do you subscribe to that yeah generally yeah they uh that was helpful to me when it was there only I don't actually remember what was in the book only one line which was they can't tell you about the solution but they can tell you about their problem so all your questions need to be first about their problem and then at the end if you want to ask about about your solution great but just assume they don't really know that what the solution needs to look yeah I think that's true try to avoid yes no questions uh which is harder than it sounds and there's a bunch of kind of user research tips tricks of like if somebody mispronounces something go with their pronunciation otherwise they're gonna like don't break Rapport exactly exactly like a lot that's true actually I think I do that and it sort of is like a problem because it's kind of a knowt all move right and then it makes them feel like their mind goes over there exact oh am I am I being stupid did I say something exactly where you just like want them to like stream of Consciousness at you basically yeah exactly do you have any good hustle stories for how vanta kind of got the flywheel going because you know stups don't kind of just like explode right away necessarily and I've seen your like AR chart which looks like a beautiful hockey stick totally but if you zoom in it's like wow that was a year where it's like pretty kind of small and then then it started to accelerate was there anything you did that you thought was interesting unique um that kind of took hustle creativity it's so funny looking back because like I sent a bunch of outbound emails to YC companies but I didn't know the word outbound at the time right I was like emailing YY Founders for feedback and I legitimately did want their feedback kind of to this but it was like half a like okay I'm going to spend you know 60 70% of the call talking about the problem and how you're solving it and then the end be like I building a thing would you like to hear about it but it was like totally cold outbound you know I just like didn't know that word so you emailed a bunch of people that got the ball rolling what happened after that honestly the early strategy was like just do and try everything and then see what works so what did work the outbound worked there was a word of mouth we tried actually really hard in the early days to basically build this call response and like founder slack channels or VC slack channels where someone said sock to and someone else would say vanta and you just wanted this you know how you that you're saying like build a brand in people's mind yeah and that was great great for a while and then uh a bunch of knockoffs came and there's a bunch of other ways to get sucked to and so that that Association I remember you guys had the billboard was like uh what is it compliance that doesn't suck too much y still up yeah that was good still up um uh yeah I joke with people like we make software but like we also make a billboard and we're equally known for both they're like equally as as important um what else uh pod advertising really worked in I mean actually still really works but like really worked in the early days I thought podcast advertising was just gonna be like sending money out the window I was totally wrong and that's what happened somebody on your team pitches you this Eric pitches you Eric was like I want 20K go on Twi this weekend startups or something and I like rolled my eyes and said fine whatever go you're totally worked she was totally right Eric is like this mythical figure to me now where I've only ever heard great Eric stories and so I don't want to hear any if anybody has a bad Eric story or an idea he had that did turn out true don't tell me please no all right I want to ask you about a couple of your of your controversial or maybe just less um consensus opinions I've seen you write these somewhere on the internet you tell me if you still believe these and and why consistency is overrated this is on your website oh yeah people read a lot into this I'm just like joking with myself because I say contact me through these four waves that all have totally different names on them oh like it's like my naming consistency over like minor self-awareness um thing that I think people think is meant to be a broad philosophical statement do I actually think it's a broad philosophical statement no probably not I think V's taught me consistency is actually underrated yeah I was going to say you strike me as somebody whose consistency first yeah um it's bad it's bad when the goal posts move I don't know if you're saying you think this or that other people think I think other people the advice tends to be right like you know if your go post keep moving it's hard to find happiness and like you're always find happiness means so like what me like uh I mean I mean get B in lots of forms of life but like let's take startup Founders just cuz right it's like you want to start a company you want to hire some people you want to raise a seed round you want to get to like a million in AR but then by the time you get there you're like actually I want to get to 10 right that's it yeah yeah that and there's like always something you are chasing and I think that it's generally seen as a recipe for unhappiness right like why can't you be happy in the moment You' did this thing prior you thought was great like why can't you think it's great and I think that can be true in some cases but I actually think or I think the the the trick is SL downside is if you're like only happy at when you hit a goalpost and then you're moving them like you'll never be happy if you actually just like the work right so it doesn't matter and a lot of things are more sustainable when you like the work especially when you have a lot of work to do my formula is progress equals happiness which is that no matter where you are it's sort of like the the Y intercept doesn't matter the slope matters and so wherever you're at if you don't feel a sense of progress in your life you will feel unhappy and then you'll feel even worse you'll feel guilty for feeling unhappy because you're like I guess I do have all these good things in my life but I still don't feel this way I'm just fundamentally broken inside I'll never be happy right when actuality it's just a sense of progress even better a sense of progress in a direction that you have set out intentionally that you care about y um and I think that in that sense moving the goal post is great because you're saying I would like to continue making progress I enjoy progress so much I why would I stop my progress that stops my happiness right it's a different way of looking at it do you remember deep cut 10 12 years ago Jess who was a founder of Polyvore at the time now sooya wrote a blog post about founder psychology no what did it say it was like w basically like wire founder is always unhappy and she's like especially when their companies go like this and it was a line up into the right and she's like because if you zoom you know again y access getting higher like what is it you know cuz if you zoom in on the graph it doesn't look like a you know 45° angle it looks like a roller coaster that is going slightly higher right right but it's like the roller coaster along the way and like you know again even when you zoom out and you've got this levely 45 degree line the Downs hurt every time yeah it's the peak to trough that that that you feel you don't really even recognize that you've gotten higher progressively each time you also have another one which is high high standards are bad you think that in general you people don't say this but they imply it in different ways that you know don't have such high standards uh right what is what's a situation where that's come up for you or you felt that I think a lot of vtis stuff and I think within the company and then with you know kind of Partners or folks outside and I mean some of the feedback we get that like I kind of I don't know appreciate more than anything else is like people care people respond super quickly like you know again something might have gone wrong but the person tries really hard to fix it right and I think those things definitely don't happen Everywhere by accident it's not to say I had I mean hopefully a small role in it but I think when people join there's a little bit of like oh the bar is here at vanta like kind of scary did I join the right place like what's going on what's an example that where would somebody feel that uh couple places but I guess in go to market our expectations around quot ENT attainment on that there way off industry they're way higher and I think if you just if one just hears them in the in a vacuum they're sort of like what is what like why would I why would I sign up for that then they join and it's like oh cuz you're surrounded by people who are like into what they do getting better every day want to get better every day care a lot and that sort of environment can be like really infectious I'm curious did you ever read this leaked production document from Mr Beast you ever take a look at that did you see that going around like a few weeks ago I know you know the put found foundit what is itct I think yes but what um part of a lawsuit Mr Beast like internal dock he wrote for his production team leaked a big part like we've gotten to know him and become uh you know pretty friendly with with Jimmy over time and it's just St like the number one thing you go hang out with Jimmy for a couple days like you walk away and you're like oh he that's what people that's what it means when people say real you know Steve Jobs us this reality Distortion field yep and it's and literally he he his company's based in like a Tiny Town in North Carolina so like he gets people to move there and then once you're there you're in his bubble and in his bubble the expectations of what work is about what success is about what we're able to do about the timelines we do them on about what it means when something says no not possible and he's like like one of things he like push past the no he's like you know you have to be able to push past the no you don't always have to get it to be a yes but like if you just come back and you said oh we um you know we asked for the permit and they said it's going to take 6 months and he like that can't be the end of the story and I we saw it on every little thing like for example we wanted to play basketball the next day it was midnight and somebody was like oh man I can't wait till tomorrow like I just want to play and he goes well why do we have to wait well it's midnight Jimmy what are you gonna do he's like I'm sure there's a gym around here somewhere let's go let's go find one and we're like yeah but they're going to be locked it's midnight like schools aren't going to be open he's like call the athletic directors he's like just call call all of them right now in the county it'll take us 20 minutes and offer any of them a thousand bucks see if they'll come open it and like part of it was like oh he just throws money at every problem but actually it's not about throwing money at it it's yeah everybody else would immediately just default to like this not possible not feasible not not going to be doable whereas his default assumption on any any given thing is like why not of course we could do that y it's just a matter of deciding if we wanted it we'll do it if we don't we won't but that's it and you just see that time after time after time hanging out with them on big things like you know the videos that they're going to go shoot but the small things and it's just a different gear it's like oh your gear is like my my stick shift only goes to six yours goes to nine okay if I'm going to hang out with you I now need to decide like how I'm going to get to eight or nine because otherwise I'll just be sticking out this won't be the right place for me yeah totally and I think there's a uh I mean I think also if you like experience that and you're like you know what I'm go with six right totally reasonable decision like not that you know arguably maybe a better decision in some cases it's like totally fine but the the like their might be there might be a nine um for any given thing I think it's a helpful mindset you also raised a bunch of money late so you didn't raise early on you got to 10 million in ARR before you went and raised your series a y I'm not so curious about as to why you did that because I'm guessing the answer is pretty simple which is like we didn't necessarily need it we just stayed focused on selling the product that was working um but more so when you went to go do it what was that experience like cuz oh it was had yeah it great um it was really funny so people or VCS in San Francisco Broadley like knew we were doing well because of kind of the slack Channel chatter like advant had come up but they sort of didn't know how well and so there was one pitch meeting I remember what they and sorry you kept it lowkey right on purpose kept lowkey on purpose because basically we were like we have this great idea and everyone else thinks they can't even like spell what we're working on think it you know has K and to do things on your feet and I would rather they know cuz then somebody's going to start knocking this off and copying but anyway very smart VC very good at his job like go and pitch and I start walking through the slides and I get to the AR ramp chart the you know 10 at the end of it basically and his jaw just drops and he was like clearly speechless and he's looking at it and he's like I thought you were at like two and a half um and you're like now that was you know the the of 10 and heway like keep going and at the end we sort of like we like not going to like we missed it like we're not going to be able to do this uh I can like try to introduce you to someone else but like you know there was F like like you know there were other people but it was this kind of interesting pitch experience um and then basically I go into meeting with another VC he's very good at his job and he's like you know what thought you were at 9.4 cuz I'd like taken your Twitter chart and backed it out and Tak the and counted the pixels and I was like I did the proportions I was like she said 10 so if this is 10 where was she a year ago 2.7 or whatever totally he had basically done that and that was also you're like oh was great so good at your job so fun is that who you end up going with or no uh no you're great but se's calling see um no but I think actually it was till the goldo stuff and I'm you know not very good at celebrating but it was a moment where I like took a I mean a beep like a week and I was like no I am going to like tell this story and what we've done and like I'm deeply proud it I would have told you that but now I like feel overwhelmingly proud of it right um and like here's how the pieces fit together here's how they will fit together and I believe it and so that was just then it became like uh I still kind of hate fundraising but it was talking about something I believed in just fun right Eric told me that he thinks you're great at negotiating you said so funny you said uh that's surprising to you but he he was not uh he was not wishy-washy about it he's like she's incredible at negotiating one of the best I've ever been around ask her how or why she does it so no pressure yeah no it's like Tru surprising I think if I'm confident I'm actually confident in it and then we'll just stand and like not blink not swerve if we're playing chicken won't eat the marshmallow it's like I got it like let me know when you want these terms I'm happy to sit here and wait and actually truly I'm like happy to sit there and wait at that point so I think it's just a lot of that it's like I won't if I believe it I won't Flinch cool well thank thank you for doing this this has been amazing um where should people you know find you find vanta maybe give it a shout yeah uh v.com V n.com um if you need any help with anything security or compliance related we would love to help you out awesome well thank you for doing this thank you so [Music] much for

all right so check this out I'm going to tell you about three products that are hidden in PL sight and the genius of these is that they take something that's free and they sell it they take a free thing and they sell it and I'm going to tell you about one example that makes hundreds of thousands of dollars another one that makes millions of dollars and then another one that's made hundreds of millions of [Music] dollars all right I want to tell you about a couple of business bus ideas I'm going to start with one that makes thousands of dollars hundreds of thousands let's say one that makes millions of dollars and one that makes hundreds of millions of dollars and they're all products that are hidden in plain sight so we've all seen them but you probably never even realize their businesses and secondly the magic thing about all of them they sell a product that's actually free what inspired this did you just see something found one found a second found a third drew a line three dots make a line so that that's kind of what happened here so first is I'm on Twitter and I see Joe gbia who's the founder of Airbnb friend of the podcast I see Joe tweet out something about a screenshot of an app that was checking water um water quality uh so the cleanliness of water it was this app called Oasis I thought that sounds familiar Sam mentioned that like I don't know six months ago Sam mentioned that in passing but I never really paid much attention to it what is the story of this thing Oasis so here's one that's making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year selling a product that is free and it's hidden in plain sight and it's just water quality testing so there's a kid who is behind this and we we we chatted with him so Oasis is a app it's an app that checks the water quality it'll tell you if your city's water is clean if your County's water is clean it'll tell you you can hold up a bottle of this aquapa right here and it will tell you is this aquapa actually clean or does it contain you know P forever chemicals that whole deal right what's what's in app and a website right an app and a website and it's started by this guy named Cormac and Cormac is from Minnesota which is known for having really fresh water he said drink growing up he would just drink tap water no problem he drink hose water like you Sam and that was what he did and then he moves to LA and he just starts doing the same thing he starts drinking tap water he notice tastes a little bit different and he gets an upset stomach he gets a little bit sick nothing life-threatening but he's like dude that's weird um like I just I just drank the water like why is the water so much different here so he tries to look it up he says how do I find out if my water is actually safe to drink out of the tap and it turns out that you can go to any City and you can request a report you can request a report about the water quality in your area so he does that and he finds oh man there's tons of contaminants in my water and so he stops drinking tap water he goes to Whole Foods he buys water from Whole Foods he says well let me see if this one is actually contaminated too turns out you can contact any B bottled water company and they have to provide you a report about the testing of their water and he finds that the water is being sold in Whole Foods also has lots of contaminants in it and then he's like what the what's going on here and so he creates a app really for himself but for others too to be able to check the uh quality of water whether it's your city your town or bottled water that you're drinking and he's basically just aggregating free data that already exists that anybody could go so when we first mentioned it it was on the Jeremy gfin episode a few months back it was at $10,000 a month in revenue and the way that you make revenue is I think he has an affiliate scheme where like if you buy something that he recommends he gets a cut and also you pay $50 right there's a pay wall yeah so you basically you request a report you can get some information free if you want like you know the full report or whatever you pay 40 45 bucks 49 bucks or something like that for a free for an annual membership to this app so you can continue and by the way when I shared this I knew it was a wall and people were like who the hell would pay for this and I was like in that camp at first and then I start clicking around the website and I'm like oh my God my towns here right and it says it might be dirty but I can't see the results unless I give them $50 and so like I understand why it's actually incredibly valuable but I mean look at the numbers so it's doing let's say uh 40,000 a month now in Revenue so 40,000 a month so basically a half a million bucks a year and but if you do the math 45 bucks if it's a you know $45 subscription you know he's only got a few thousand subscribers to this thing so it's not like it's it's not like everybody's paying for this but a small number of people really care about the quality of water and are willing to pay to get the information and he structured it and so what he did was he started off with all the free reports then when he you know couldn't get the free reports or wanted to test more things he's uh or wanted to verify their reports he'll do his own independent testing but it's very expensive it's like you know Couple Grand to do independent testing of a product to find out does it actually lineup so he's slowly doing them one by one as he gets more money and he said you know we live in a world where we think we live in abundance you could walk to Target Trader Joe's you'll find 20 different protein bars 30 different Waters but the problem is most of it's filled with toxins none of it is actually healthy so my mission is to build 100% independent platform to test products and provide healthy alternatives and I think this is kind of awesome right like I think this is this is kind of amazing and the way that he's growing this thing because you might wonder how does he get customers for this is he just does Tik toks that go viral so check out this video so it's a video about like liquid death right here right and so he'll post this video Tik Tok just very simple green screen over a product and he's talking about how um you know I used to think this is really healthy but actually it's full of chemicals and blah blah blah if you want more if you want to figure out which products are actually clean use my app and um this video will get you know a million plus views and it'll drive a bunch of PE bunch of attention and it actually go and then drives people to download the app and go ahead and and uh and sign up so very simple way to to test this to to drive traffic to this product and it's something you can do over and over and over again apps like Tik Tok and Instagram reals to a slightly lesser extent YouTube shorts to a lesser extent you can just once you find a format that works you can literally repost the same thing and the algorithm is just going to say yep humans like this and it's just going to keep serving it up to a lot of people even if they're even if they don't follow you and so when people have figured out these like simple formats that work they just copy paste and post the same 90% of the same video over and over and over again and I know several people that are building multi-million dollar businesses doing this I'm so turned on right now this is the greatest thing dude this this guy so he shows his Revenue uh on Twitter which is pretty cool so Oasis metrics over the last 28 days monthly gross revenue he shows his 25,000 and he shows his churn he shows everything I I actually predict this could to be a significantly larger product than I think it many tens of millions of dollars or even more the reason being is the way that these review websites work is you typically have to hire a lot of Freelancers in order to go out and write all of the articles but if you're just using data to like organized as a table it's way more profitable also he's getting early in he's getting in early on a trend I think this water thing is still tiny tiny tiny compared to what it's going to be like in the next 10 and 20 years I think he's on to something life-changing for himself yeah absolutely all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of a 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think okay so I promised you I would tell you about a company that's hidden in plain site that is using free selling free information and making hundreds of thousands check now I want to tell you about one that's making millions and then we'll go to the hundreds of millions okay so the millions one and we've mentioned this once before but it was years ago so I want to bring it up again if you've ever been to a company's office and you walk into their break room or their maybe their their kitchen where they have snacks you'll always notice on the wall that there is this poster and our eyes just glaze over it we don't ever look at it looks just just like a looks like you know when you're on an airplane and you see the safety thing in the the seat back in front of you it looks like that but it's on the wall and this is a labor law poster and the reason that your office had it is the reason that all offices have it it's required by law that you have to post this in your your employee you know break room or or open area and these labor law posters they update every year so you have to get a new one every year and they're required by law okay so that's the that's the good news the bad news is you have to buy them or do you and so here's the the interesting thing about this business there's a couple of companies that do this I I I don't have all their their names and information here but uh I remember finding one that was like based in Minnesota and what the guy was doing was he's just all he does is print labor law posters so what what they'll do is they'll mail you a letter to your business and the letter looks a littleit scary and it says hey if you don't have this poster up you are in VI violation of California labor laws right now and you must have this up it is a is a requirement by law it costs $45 take this box send this back to us we will send you your poster and you do that you send it they send you the poster you put it up on your wall you forget about you move on and this is a private company that sends that letter correct now the thing is these labor law posters are actually free you could just go to your State labor law website you can get the labor law posters but companies have realized that using this sort of like awareness tactic tactic making it easy sort of scaring the hell out of you is a way to make a couple million dollar a year on super high margins because all you do is printing the same poster single skew single product one one product a year and you just send it out to businesses and they then they fair I'm on I'm on the government's website and figuring out how to order the poster for free is actually hard of course of course just like filing your taxes is a little bit confusing and Turbo Tax and others have made a you know they they turn the button into bright shiny green buttons instead of small gray buttons that you don't know which one to click right so there is a tremendous amount of value in simply either aggregating and structuring data and making it available for people or helping you just comply without you know having to figure out how to comply and U you know maybe the $50 tax is worth it every year as your subscription but that's what these companies do so labor law posters a way to make millions of dollars selling a product that's free and a business again that's hidden in plain sight and I bring this up because one of the great things about this podcast that I hope we do for people is that you will go from a mindset where success seems rare and hard to grasp and you're sort of thinking what is it I need a great idea and great ideas are rare they're hard to find to a mindset of everything I see in my life every object in my view it's not there by accident that is that sign is there for a reason that cable is there for a reason somebody realize you needed that and they created that once you realize that you realize oh my God business is everywhere this is a business this is a business this is a business business and then you realize Wow all I got to do is figure out one of these that seems easy right it's like in a Jar full of Skittles picking one it doesn't seem that hard and that's what you know I I think I hope to to sort of achieve by bringing up these businesses because not only are they clever little business models but it just points out that your eyes are just glazing over million dollar opportunities everywhere you walk because they are literally everywhere you go into a parking lot look at the ground somebody painted those stripes and when you go look at it you go you can go ask the owner of the real estate say who paints the stripes for your parking lot they'll say oh we use these guys you go talk to them you say wow you just paint straight lines in parking lots that's what you do yep how much money do you make you know is this a small business oh you did s Million last year Revenue no profit oh my God right and then you you realize oh my God there's somebody who makes $7 million a year profit painting white lines on the on the road dude I when I first moved to San Francisco I lived with this guy he was one of my roommates and he was a piece of crap but he was telling me how he was making hundreds of dollars a month because apparently the Church of latterday saints Mormons they you can order a Bible for free on their website I guess but they like it's like Legion and they'll like come and hand deliver it but they'll like try to like you know convert you to their faith or whatever and he created an online store selling Bibles for 20 bucks and somehow raped on Google and he just went and took the person's information and put it into the morbid's website and on his website they're like you know we hand deliver Bibles or something like that and it was like oh that's hilarious and I I remember this guy and I was like this is a horrible scam that's amazing uh but it was very funny he was making like $500 a month uh doing this that is so funny oh my God that what happened to that guy I he's one of those guys you know how like you have these friends and frankly you and I are those people maybe where they're like do hacky [ __ ] you have those friends it's like dude do you remember how we met yeah where it was like you do this hacky [ __ ] and you're like this is going to go one of two ways like it's going to go the right way or the wrong way miles was the wrong way so like he like kind of disappeared he probably got in trouble for a crypto scam um what's the uh yeah it was like it was crazy but like on his about page he was like why did my why did the person who delivered my Bible want to talk to me and his his think said yeah they tend to do that Mormons loved it so like it said like right like just expain how like you're G to get hand delivered by these Mormon guys uh what's the third one okay third one um here's a product that is used I believe billion times a day it is a product that Time Magazine said is in the 50 things that made the world economy work do you want to take a guess what this is it's a hard one I know this is this is pretty fun uh do you have one or two more hints like many great inventions it was invented maybe 20 years before it actually got used so somebody invented this thing they're like this is cool but how do we what do we use it for they couldn't find a use case and finally they found a use case oh I I'll give you another example um every time you buy a product you use this product I feel like I'm doing those annoying riddles where it's like I'm I'm awake at night but not during the day what am I like you could sit on me but not take me with you all right I'll end the suspense the answer by the way is a chair what is that it's a barcode so oh that's cool do you know the story behind the barcode no all right so let me give you a little history lesson I know you like history so uh barcode is invented by these two guys Norman Woodland and Bernard silver and these guys are inspired by morse code they realize that wow mors code is so simple it's just basically it's dots and dashes the dash I think is a like a rest basically and the dot is like you know the sound and they're like could we create another system that's like that maybe a visual system so they create a system actually looked like a circle at the time so it was like a circle and they're like oh look with thin lines and thick lines we can create like an basically an infinite number of unique tags for something and they're like oh this is great they patent it but it's not really a good use case for it and then people try to use it for a couple things you know they realize oh you know what we could do we could track um train containers you know we're always wondering where those containers are where in the route that they are and if they ever get unloaded so they put a barcode on the side of a train container and it works great everyone's really excited that's working great for a second and then the problem is trains are outside they get dirty and as soon as any dirt gets on the thing it ruins the barcode so they're like this is bad idea take it off scrap it and then they try it on some second thing doesn't really work either and and basically for like I don't know a couple decades or something nobody's using barcodes at the same time in another part of the world um you get the invention of the laser and the laser gets invented the laser is a really great way to scan something that that becomes interesting but but they don't really know what they're scanning why what are we scanning this for lasers have multiple uses but that gets invented and then in the third part of the world three things come together the thirdd part of the world is grocery stores are having a really tough time because they are trying to stock inventory and they're sort of by hand keeping track of all the inventory they have think about this in a store there so many units it's taking so many hours of Labor and then if any customer checks out it's so slow because okay every item you have I got to punch it into the register exactly what this is I got to either remember the prices or I got to write this in and then I have to keep stock of the inventory levels it's a pain in the ass so they create do do you think that like when w so Walmart was invented created founded almost around this time do you think that a barcode is one of the reasons like would that have prevented companies from scaling is just the operational so Walmart opened their first door in 1962 this was now 10 years later so 74 uh is when this starts to happen they they're hitting this problem it's too slow too much labor too expensive so they create the ad hoc committee for the uniform grocery product identification code and they go into the lab and they're like all right we need something they find this technology there oh remember what's that guy Norman always talking about that goddamn barcode what if we use that what if we use this laser and they come together and they create the barcode and they change the shape of it instead of the circle shape they change it to the rectangular shape that we all know and love today and the first barcode ever gets scanned as a pack of wriggley's gum in 1974 and so and they're like wow that just took it knew the price it I took me one second and it's deducted my stock level by one oh my God that's this was magic and so you know this is like the blockchain getting invented right it's like oh my God how do they convince all of the manufacturers to put this on their thing they just like rally around retailers demand it so the retailers are saying this going to they're they're the ones with the hair on fire problem right they're spending all this money and time on labor so they say hey if you want to be in our store you got to start adding these things to your product and and so for a manufacturer you're like oh if I want shelf space which is the most important thing for me oh great I'll happily stick this this on here and so they're all working and where do but the problem is where do they get the code and how do I make sure that your code is not the same as my code right like what what's going to prevent that well we all got to go through some Central thing that's going to you know give us the barcodes that I can use for my product to make sure nobody else can use it it's like reserving namespace or a license plate it's like how do I get my my exact license plate that nobody else is GNA have and there became what's known today as gs1 gs1 is the nonprofit that issues these barcodes and keeps track of who owns the barcode space and to get barcode space you got to pay but again remember every store has standardized on one thing so if you want to be in a store or you want your goods in an Amazon warehouse for example you now need to use their system which means they have infinite pricing leverage and they charge a [ __ ] ton for these barcodes and so and is that gs1 who's charging gs1 so gs1 let me tell a little bit about this this nonprofit you can go look them up because they're nonprofit so last year 8 $81 million in Revenue uh barcode sales makes up 90 93% of this and again a barcode is nothing it's literally like a just a set of lines that they're selling for $90 million a year and um they now have $46 million of assets that they've just been stockpiling the CEO makes $3 million a year the CFO makes a million dollar a year the SVP of community engagement which God knows what that guy's doing making $800,000 a year this might be the job of all time he happy hours yeah exactly like what do you do um and they you know they stash $30 million in overseas places like the Caribbean and Central America and all of their expenses pretty much half of their expenses are they like staff salaries lobbying against the QR code is there like a barcode QR code like Lobby where they're just fighting each other I think QR codes are just a type of barcode uh they're just a threedimensional got it okay or 2D sorry um so yeah that isn't that crazy though that this this nonprofit now has half a billion dollars in assets just selling barcodes and any retailer anybody who's ever had to like get your products you know you let's say you want to sell on Amazon Amazon says you got to do this it's a racket you end up just having to pay whatever they demand in order to to get your products on the shelves do you know how like there's been a lot of cool movies lately there's been a cool movie on the guy who created Blackberry I think there was one on the person who helped create Tetris and then there was another one for the person who helped create the Pop-Tart these like kind of cool like product creation stories go uh I wonder if is there an interesting one here somebody's just sitting there is like what if podcasts were movies and then they just turn like every episode of like acquired or how I built this into a documentary dude well this guy Bernard silver like that that this is actually a way more interesting story than uh I would have thought because this is something that changed culture it changed it changed so many things like it you know we talk about in flections and how like you know the iPhone was invented which had all these ramifications including a GPS being there which now means that Uber has the ability to exist and then there's like Milli a million examples of that this is one of those inflections where like this barcode helped create let's say a or made a Walmart possible or made this other thing possible which like literally shaped a history and and this is actually really fascinating stuff yeah exactly uh so so this is just a it's a space that you again you don't think you don't even think this is like like a you don't think where does this come from where does this little thing come from and again it doesn't come from nowhere somebody creates it and then that person who creates it now has you know something they can charge for and there's business everywhere so it's so funny that this episode is accidentally turning into a theme a theme of things that you don't really think about but how they became a thing um I have actually an example of one of those can I tell you it yeah go all right so in the 1960s in Hawaii started to become common I think it was because of like one hotel where your employees were allowed to wear an a Hawaiian shirt to work on Friday because for the most part you had to wear a suit to work you know like dressing formal was how business people operated all of the time and this whole Casual Friday idea it sort of started getting popular in Mainland America where like in the 1980s HP was like hey everyone you can wear a Hawaiian shirt to work on a Friday which was a big deal because they employed tens of thousands of people so it was like a it was kind of like a statement but in reality up until the late ' 80s and early 90s virtually everyone wore suits to work all of the time however this executive at Levis so Levis had just launched Dockers and Dockers were khaki pants up until then khaki pants were almost considered uh you know if you look at like the history of of of fashion like suits were considered like the that's the standard that's what you do khakis were basically casual Weare even though now we don't look at them as casual that's what they were they were casual Weare and Levi creates Dockers because they want to the Khaki business but still people are like this is too casual we can't wear these any other time except for Saturday and Sunday and so this marketing executive at Levis Has This brilliant idea they print up 40,000 pamphlets that explains to HR professionals here's this new thing called business casual and casual Friday and here's the rules of this holiday or this like new tradition it was just an eight page pamphlet and it said it didn't promote Levis or Dockers though but in all the photos you'll see like a picture of someone wearing jeans and it is like a Levi's logo or you'll see a picture of someone wearing khakis and you just assume that it's Dockers and so this thing takes off it works so they we got to read this though a guide to Casual businessware ideas for dressing professionally at work and then it basically shows like pants Jeans like it's showing like options ideas for it and then is there a uh rules for it so what are the rules that they said yeah it says don't wear like tattered jeans but they should be nice new jeans right or like like they can't be stained or what else does it say uh SLE no sleeveless no tanks oh man I mean discrimination baby steps baby STS we're going we're going from Suits to khakis like you know like it takes time I mean should we guns out Wednesday do you think we can make this happen I I I well I'm actually got to talk about that in a second but so it's a good avoid lingerie okay fair enough um save athletic wear for after workor and don't forget to check footwear opto sandals are gross no no it just says not appropriate yeah it's a great little pamphlet so they sent this out to literally 40,000 HR Executives um and they even go as far to create an HR hotline so if you work at uh IBM and you're like you know I actually don't know protocol for like our open o our sandels allowed or like whatever I could call this hotline and I could ask the inventur of Casual Friday hey can Sydney wear like open are shoes allowed to or are toes allowed to be seen even if like their toenails are polished like whatever like you can like ask these questions and it takes off and Casual Friday officially becomes a thing and so it literally shaped culture and it was all because Levis was like we got to sign these guys up we got to start selling uh some of the stuff and like back then it was kind of the American Apparel industry was a little bit in a rut they weren't doing that great and this changed everything and so people started buying Dockers buying Levis because this movement of Casual Friday totally picked up and it got me thinking this is like some pretty brilliant marketing I call this marketing you can call it cultural shift marketing or tradition hijacking and so people who have like found little traditions and they blow up the tradition or they blow up this idea and then they say and by the way if you want to buy in this idea we just so happen to have the thing that can make your life a little better and so there's a few other examples of this that I can I can present to you so the first one is the beers so they're a diamond company they've been around I think for hundreds of years actually in the 1940s they ran this campaign called The Diamond is forever and it was this idea that like diamonds are special because up until the 1940s diamonds were special but they weren't nearly as special as we think they are now and they also came up with this in idea which is they're like this campaign they come up with how much should you spend on a diamond and they said roughly two to three months of your salary which is like outrageous but that alone is like what that campaign is credited as helping shape the diamond industry they even ran further campaigns that said on certain anniversaries you have to get your wife a diamond um another one is breakfast being the most important meal of the day Cog invented that idea and so like we grow up now we tell our kids you have to eat breakfast it's the most important thing kogan Ed that prior prior to that people didn't always think that right two other ones are baby showers and and wedding Registries so baby showers weren't a thing until Johnson and Johnson started running ad campaigns think you have to have a baby shower if you're pregnant or if you're uh Macy's came up with the idea of wedding Registries they said um you're gonna get married you gotta people gotta buy you all this stuff and and and in fact you don't want people just to buy you random stuff because what happens if they buy you the same stuff that you already have or two guests buy you the same thing like that's ridiculous you have to create this registry at Macy's so you can register and then finally spring cleaning is another one that really wasn't the thing until Lysol came up with this idea of spring cleaning wow dude these are great I love I I I don't know if other people get as fired up about these I get so fired up about these I think because it's the same idea as a while these businesses are hidden plain side you know this object just didn't just get here someone made it come here all of these occasions these these sayings these these holidays they didn't just pop up out of nowhere somebody made them happen and when you find out that it's some marketing dork it's some marketing dork somewhere that was like you know what like how do we spring sales are slow spring sales are slow spring spring Spring Fling no spring clean no spring cleaning it's like yes that's how we're going to get people to buy cleaning products this in the spring I love that I love that just a a mad ad man somewhere in the world can just shift how people do things there's a great we did an episode with um Craig Clemens about exactly this was it like leaky gut he did he did prebiotics but he didn't talk too much about that um uh it was was he was talking about the ones that have um like the ones you're talking about like why we eat bacon for breakfast why we drink orange juice right like where orange juice came from and like all these things that today just seem like I don't know it's just what we do it's just Staples of the of people's diet it's just tradition and it's like no no that wasn't tradition or you know the classic one is toothpaste he talks about how at a certain time about only 6% of the population brushed their teeth and so when they wanted to increase sales of toothpaste he said well we can't just sell more toothpaste to the 6% of people who already brush their teeth we need to get the other 94% of people to start brushing their teeth how are we going to do that and that's when he came up with that campaign um not Craig but like Claude Hopkins it was um it was like rub the tongue on the on your teeth and you feel that film yeah one of one of them exactly it was like you know basically saying take your tongue rub rub it on your teeth you feel that film that's and he and people did that as soon as they read it they do it they stick their tongue there and it's gross and you're like there's a way to get that off and then you'll have that Hollywood Pearl smile and then people wanted that right and so that created this movement and then by the end of that campaign something like 70 or 80% of people now brushed their teeth in America it was like a huge shift that happened just off of that one adman that single big idea and I love these I've really actually like toyed with the idea of writing a book about just these the these crazy admin and then the way that they've actually shifted culture yeah and and and that fascinates me as well and like another one is like Wall Street Journal and so they try to like they they they sort of nailed it but they it hasn't PR it hasn't stuck with us but it was the idea of once you graduate college the gift that you get is uh a Wall Street Journal subscription just like I think Rolex did it was like once you you know president's Club is you get a Rolex if you uh sell if you hit some sales quota right like or you become president of whatever and so I was thinking what other things haven't been hijacked that can be and so I've got a few examples but the first one being friendsgiving so friendsgiving is what like 20s somethings who are single is what they celebrate uh instead of a Thanksgiving with their family they do friends giving in their town or in the city that they're living in and so I think friendsgiving is one that there's not a clear winner as to who owns friendsgiving but we can make it an entire week of being thankful for your friends and you will do various gestures including having them over for dinner to show your uh how appreciative you are that they are now your friends and so we could sell gift boxes we could sell gratitude journals we could do digital cards we could do all types of stuff and by the way speaking of cards Hallmark is like one of the inventures of like Valentine's Day Mother's Day things like that uh the other one graduation SE season so turning into a life transition planning or celebrating New Life phases all because of graduating so we're going to call it graduation season and so what do you get for graduation season you get financial planning subscriptions productivity tools career coaching travel discounts that's for graduation season you said you've thought about this what are other ones that You' thought about oh I mean come on on theot no no no no no no no no like examples of things where you're like that's amazing that they pulled that off uh like Craig talked about the Otis Elevator one which I thought was amazing did do you remember that so he basically talks about how back in the elevators got invented far before they were used what does that mean so the elevator gets invented but people didn't want to use them they didn't want to they didn't scared they're scared because there were situations where elevators would just plumet and you just Plum it to your death so it's like okay no thanks and the the consequence of that is think about it if you don't have elevators you don't have tall buildings right because people are only going to go up so many flights of stairs so like New York was like you know four stories high there was just no there was no buildings taller than that so cities were kind of limited in how big they could be and this guy Otis ends up creating a um an elevator with automatic braks okay so Otis creates the automatic braking elevator he's like this is it this is going to be amazing everybody's going to buy my elevators and if you look today by the way you go go to any elevator you'll see a little thing on the wall almost always says Otis um but it didn't happen right away and he couldn't figure out why he's like this has automatic brakes it solves the problem but nobody believed it and so Craig talks about how one of the techniques that the marketers use is a they have like break the elevator and like film it like getting caught exactly so the world fair was going on and Otis decides to go all in and he creates this uh show basically so he creates this exhibit where he's got an elevator suspended in the air hanging by ropes cables like they would and he because he had watched Cirus solay he was kind of like inspired by oh wow cir man they're stunts and their spectacles are so all inspiring you can't help but look at it so he said I got to do that so he gets somebody up there and he stands in the elevator and he says ladies and gentlemen I have created the the world's first safe elevator the elevator with automatic braks and he gets the guy at the top to swing an ax and he cuts one rope and the elevator starts swaying and swinging and it's hanging by a thread now and everyone's gasping in the crowd and he's like Cut the Rope and then the guy swings he cuts the Rope elevator starts to go down two feet and then it automatic breaks and it stops and he says all safe gentlemen and he says something like whatever he says some famous phrase that basically says like Otis Elevator when you're in an Otis Elevator you know all is well all is well you you will be safe and elevator sales take off from there and when elevator Sals take off now buildings can be taller it literally reshaped the way that cities work all because this guy realized that he needed to think out of the box in terms of his marketing and he needed to do something that would break through the noise and it would actually shift culture shift perception about a product in a dramatic way and one tool the tool belt is that Craig called these the hijacks of the human mind the seven human hijacks and he's like one way to hijack the mind there a spectacle like this does Craig have a book I got to Rel listen to that one does Craig have a book this is after that episode I hit Craig up and I was like Hey I want to write this book with you and we talked about it we both got really excited about it but we're both busy so this might be the motivation to rekindle that project dude the seven hit human hijacks I wrote the sign up I wrote the intro for it it's pretty dope I'll read it to you sometime oh that is awesome I'm going to have to go listen to that cuz that was like two years ago and I remember listening to it and think he's amazing can I read you the intro to this book yeah we can cut this out if it's boring but I just want I want to get your opinion on this all right so I wrote this a while back all right it's called Uh hijacks or seven human hijacks Confessions of a billion dollar marketer okay so that's Craig Craig sold over a billion dollars of products online himself okay so I said uh here's how it goes if you read this book I need you to make me a promise repeat after me I promise to use these tactics only for good and not evil because the techniques in this book not just tactics they are hijacks the same way a terrorist can hijack an airplane marketers can hijack the minds of consumers to get them to buy products they didn't even know they wanted you might be skeptical in fact I think you should be skeptical skeptical of somebody making such a bold claim but I can tell you that these product these hijacks have been used to sell i' I've used these products to I've used these hijacks to sell over a billion dollars of products personally that's one billion with a B in case you lost count um but rather than convince rather than let me convince you let me ask you did you brush your teeth this morning more importantly why who told you to do that who told you to brush your teeth in the morning your mom well who told her her mom well yeah before that who told all the moms to do this it must be the dentist right but wait who told the dentist the answer it turns out is a man named Claude Hopkins because before Claude Hopkins only 7% of the population brushed their teeth sidebar can you imagine dating back in 1913 nobody brushed their teeth feel bad for Grandpa uh after Claude Hopkins 65% of the population brushed their teeth and Claude didn't just sell toothpaste he literally changed the world he got millions of people to change their daily habits with one brilliant marketing campaign I'll show show you in chapter two but before I show you how you did it blah blah blah blah and then I go and then the chapters are like how diamonds became a girl's best friend and blah blah blah like each of the different products that that got you know embedded into culture what are the seven human hij like what are they sounds like I succeeded and got you curious you're going to have to pay $499 get and get the book like is it literally like seven different like tactics or is it sever different examples of tactics tactics and then each one has example and and you stack them so what he showed was like you know for example one of the T tactics is a spectacle like I told you about the otus elevator so like a spectacle would be one of the seven yeah like uh spectacle is one of the seven but like even the thing about like take your tongue and put it on your teeth so like a um a like a like a magic trick basically it's like the thing you know but remember the thing where people used to that power band or whatever those bracelets and they made you like hold your arm and they're like look you see how now you put your arms out and watch I can't push you over right and wow of um that's I forgot what he called it but that sort of magic trick is um is one of the things where it's a it's a demonstr a powerful demonstration right so you can demonstrate on the person themselves you can get them to feel it in feel it themselves in order to to to want to buy a product did Craig come up with this idea of seven Human been hijacks or did you come up with it on the Pod uh so he he was gonna come on and it was like cool we could talk about your business we could talk about whatever and I was like you know I said asked him one question this a very valuable question I said what's the best talk you've given recently like have you given like a presentation or a talk at all that just like really killed like you could just tell the audience loved it he's like oh dude I did this one talk inside my company just to get them fired up he's like basically my company is like a giant marketing company and I wanted them to come to work and not just feel like oh we need to raise sales by like 7% this quarter like no like he's like I wanted him to realize yo marketers you don't just drive some revenue or lift sales by x% like a marketer can literally change the way that Society works and he's like so to to get them fired up about that I told them these examples of stories that they did and then he's like when I was putting them together I realized it's the same set of techniques that they've been using across these eight 10 examples just the same same set of tactics these hijacks that they've been using and he's like that could be cool and I was like yes do that on the on the P check this out if you Google seven human hijacks Craig Clemens the first post is on Reddit and it says Craig Clemens on MFM talking about the seven human hijacks and how to use them in your marketing and it links to this amazing post that this guy uh wrote where he lists the seven on R marketing yeah it's so good so one of them for example is he talks about like the act of rebellion so how do you make your consumer feel like they're giving the middle finger To The Man by buying your product so the example he gives us back in the day when um cigarette sales were flat and cigarette sales were flat because basically cigarettes were only smoked by men and so and there was like so was already super saturated like dude we can't really get more men to smoke they kind of all smoke already and so they realized like the only way we're going to grow sales is by getting the other 50% of the population to start smoking so how do we get women to start smoking at the time it was seen as not cool it was seen as sort of like um you know it was like a kind of dirty masculine thing to do and so the guy behind the campaign um basically what he did was he used influencers so influen is one of the high jaacks so he got all of the like uh whoever like the Kardashians of their time were so he got like 30 of all together all at once and was at a time where the big problem in culture or Society was like I forgot if it was like women being able to vote or was like some other thing where it was like women were repressed in some way and so he got them all to go to this the parade or the fair the the you know the New Year's fair or the Macy's fair whatever it was like the the the parade that happens in New York and they all stood on this float and he gave them all cigarettes he said all right when you turn this corner you're going to light that cigarette right when the journalists are all there all have their cameras pointed at you you're going to light the cigarette and you're going to defiantly smoke the cigarette in front of them and you're going to do this thing that women aren't supposed to do as an you know what he called them he called it he called the sigs uh torches of Freedom exactly exactly and that's what the the newspapers he so he then put somebody in the crowd where the journalists were and he said that out loud to the journalists who then went and wrote that in their story like they they lit up these torches of Freedom um you see those ladies up there guy those are uh those are uh those are torches of Freedom that's what those are this what jeel needs to do it needs to be like these are Vapes of Freedom that these kids are using oh look at that guy that's a that's a sex machine that he's using he's he's gonna have sex with so many people because he's using that thing even even that same so then I think it was like Lucky Strike or whoever their brand color was green and green was like not invogue at the time and he's like yeah the women don't want to buy it cuz these C the box is not fashionable it's like do we need a Rebrand he's like hold my beer don't Rebrand and so instead he got those same women to go to the whatever the big um like fashion you know like like the Met Gala type of thing and all of them wore green they all wore that same green color dress and so then green became cool for women like you know basically became in Trend right after that and then you know the sales of that that um that brand went up basically because he he made the color cool and it's kind of just cool to see somebody who can Puppeteer Society in this way I'm I'm summarizing like a 9mon old episode so I might have some of the details wrong here this Reddit poster said side note a lot of these stories are documented in this amazing book called propaganda yeah that's the bernade book right it's a hard read dude I have wanted to read it but it seems like intimidating what's so hard about it you know these old books that are just like so dense it's not an easy read I don't know I my brain is very simple like a lot of people recommend books to me like oh this is a great book have you read um you know Renee Gerard like mimic Theory like oh I'm interested to go buy the book and I'm like I'm just too dumb to read this like I'm too dumb do not have the attention span to read something like this I read like the mimic Theory like summary book like what was that one that came out recently and uh it was still hard I still that one I read that that was like uh the the Malcolm Gladwell version of like Renee Gerard and I like read it and I'm like so I want what other people want is that it right uh like that's the it was I read the whole thing and I was like I don't understand why this is so many words what am I missing uh and so but I've heard about this book I've I've heard all about this uh book propaganda uh it would be fun to read or at least try to read there's something about books that are like more than 50 years old where their brains were just able to like you know they spoke differently they talk they they talk differently they they they write differently and for whatever reason my brain can't really process it very well so I kind of need somebody to like translate into modern speak or into like simpleton speak for me yeah I think maybe I'll try and do that this guy uh this seems like a cool book oh the guy who wrote it was born in 1891 and he died in 1995 wow he saw a lot all right let me tell you let me tell you about something that I did so on did you see you probably didn't see this but on Friday I tweeted that I'm going to Yale's campus I tweeted that I'm going to go check out Yale because it's like an old historical place and I wanted to like do something interesting for the the weekend something easy on Saturday tweeted it out I got like a lot of replies and it was like kind of overwhelming on what to do so on Saturday morning we just drive up there and I just go to the busiest just like part of the town where I think like I'll just figure it out when I get there I show up I see a student tour like if you're a perspective student you know like when you go at your mom and dad yeah and I just like tag te yeah I just like get I just like I just like pop it and like it's pretty funny because it's Sarah and I who I don't think either of us look young enough to be a students and then I've got my baby like strapped to my chest uh well I gave it away yeah so we're just like T we're like we like just like are in the back of this like student Le Tour listening in and then out of nowhere this kid I guess he's not that much of a kid but he's like 20 years old he goes hey Sam and I go what's up man he goes hey I I'm a big fan of the pot iist from religiously I saw that you were gonna be here so uh can I show you around and I was like yeah I would love that what are you what are you doing here what are you doing today he's like well I saw that you were coming and I just went to the most busy place there was and I just hoped that I was going to see you and here you are and so this kid gave me and now I didn't think through what happens after that but it was great and like by the way that's like the third time that's happened and I love when that happens because I like he's doing me a favor of like I would love like a local to like show me around and so he shows me all this amazing stuff so have you heard of Skull and Bones the secret society of Yale where presidents are in or all that is it legit what what what is it it's quote a secret society but I don't know like how much of a secret it is when there's like a building and like it's like a like it's like a nonprofit with like an endowment so like I don't know like what I don't know what the secret is I don't know like what what secret but it was just cool to like see this building that I've read about and then we went and saw this old graveyard it's the oldest graveyard in America and I was looking through it and I'm going to explain to you why I'm obsessed with old stuff particularly The Ivy the ivy league so it's kind of like a nerdy thing of mine where I likeed I've been to Harvard uh Princeton Yale uh a bunch of others because I just love like touring these old schools they're just cool we go to this old graveyard and we saw Noah Webster's grave you know who Noah Webster is have you heard that name dictionary Webster is that him the dictionary miam Webster's Dictionary the guy who invented the dictionary and I just was like looking at this this old graveyard and next to him was uh Charles Goodyear the guy who created vulcanized rubber which created Goodyear tires and it was awesome it was so cool and I'm actually really envious of you that you went to Duke this like historical old institution because it was so cool to like be around history where like someone came up with something and they literally invented or or standardized the English language like something that like shapes history and it's still an you know they've still impacted the way that we've done things and so it was an awesome awesome weekend to like see all this old stuff because it inspired me you know how like when you get behind the computer like every single day and you're like I'm going to do something that just makes a little bit of money sometimes you kind of get these ruts of like thinking small it was very inspirational to like see Yale and see this old institution that has lasted for centuries and how big and Global it was it was very very cool and I want to give a shout out to that kid I don't want to say his name because he said he wanted to be lowkey but I want to give him a shout out for showing me around that's awesome most white person hobby ever to go to a graveyard you'll never you'll never see uh non-white tourists hanging out in the graveyard it's not not a not a thing we do dude was awesome it was great so you you saw the Webster's Dictionary Good Year and you're like all right I'm going to come back and podcast what what what was your what are you going to do what's the move you know it it kind of put me into a little bit of a crisis where like I was asking that but like you know this podcast is definitely part of it you know I don't know about you but I sometimes think like this is like a podcast is not like impactful compared to like we're talking to guys who are inventing robots that are doing X Y and Z or like who are going to the moon but a lot of these guys were authors that I whose like uh whose grave I saw and I was still inspired by and so I felt a little bit inspiration of that but there was a little bit of a crisis of like oh man like it's important to do something like that can impact people for for centuries pars thesaurus I don't know just putting that out there see see how that lands I feel like you're good with uh coming up with alternative phrases for things so instead of saying uh you know well not just because I don't know the real phrase and I can't pronounce the word so when I mumble it just sounds like did you did you get this feeling at Duke where it was cool to be around like old uh like historical things that have lasted for a long time I know exactly what you mean there is definitely a Vibe um and a feeling when you're at something that is not just bigger than yourself but sort of Timeless the problem with Duke and other Southern schools that have this is like you're like oh wow who made you know what what is this it's like this is the slave wall it's like oh okay never mind uh it's like what what's the name of this road it's like this is Tobacco Road we had tobacco plantations it's like everything is uh there's like a sort of um Dark Side to a lot of the history there so that wasn't cool but the rest of it is in fact I used to love going to the the chap like the center of Duke's campus is the chapel and I used to go there all the time even though I'm not religious but just the aura the vibe like the vibe of a church is kind of unmatched to be honest great and um so yeah I really love really love that here's why I like Silicon Valley and why I like old stuff it's it's kind of similar which is I love thinking about things that we take for granted so for example like buildings that have been there for a long time or that are really large or even just like your streets or institutions like Yale and I'm like how did someone create something that became such an institution that we take it for granted and we don't even like reflect on like how this became a thing and Silicon Valley is cool because it's ideally the outcome is that you are creating something in real time that will become an institution like an Airbnb like a Google where it becomes a verb right uh like I'm G you know what I mean and you get to see that happening and I think it's really cool to be in Silicon Valley to see the beginning of hopeful institutions in the in the making and then ALS also go and seeing the old stuff of like this is how it's done so we just had Gary Tan on don't you think that YC should just have a campus and it should have this sort of Gothic uh you know old school institutional Vibe and even if they're if they're not going to do it why wouldn't I just go create a campus a small micro campus for YC people free free free room and board so free place to live free food that's healthy and all I do is just cherry-pick investments from people on campus I just get to invest in their companies it would be I don't even need YC to do this why why wouldn't I do this there's a or even just a museum have you ever heard of the Museum of American Finance it's this thing in New York City where it's like a mu it's like a museum for like the history of finance and frankly it's badass it's awesome and just like a place to like go and like physically explore all that YC has done it is kind of interesting it's just like Bill amman's loow first what's inside this thing what is the Museum of Modern of what of Finance yeah it's uh it's a Museum of American Finance so if you look at a photo it's just like it shows like here's what like the stock tickers used to look like and people would stand here and like trade like in the 1800s and then like then it switched to have like to the phones were on the floor you do this whatever it like tells the history of it and then like important things related to it but it's a museum in downtown uh Manhattan that's cool I like that dude this is a fun episode yeah that was a banger all right that's it that's the pod [Music]

all right everybody election day in the United States is just a few days away and I'm here to officially endorse nobody because you should not be trying to get political advice from a podcaster that you like I'm just a guy who does business and I've made a little bit of money on the internet that does not make me an expert in politics however today's episode is about politics but not in the way you might expect I am fascinated by the marketing machine that is underneath C political campaigns regardless of which candidate you're going for they're spending over a billion trying to persuade people to do a thing that's how business works too there's a marketing machine trying to convince people to push a button at the end of the day and I wanted to understand the science the tactics and the uh persuasion techniques that the different campaigns have used over the years the best stories about what's actually going on under the hood and so I invited on a guy named Sasha Eisenberg he studied this for a couple of decades now and he wrote a book that I thought was really good called the victory lab so I invited him on to come tell us some stories about how the marketing machines underneath political campaigns work I think it's fascinating enjoy this [Music] episode and it seems like there's this thing where um this whole industry that gets paid to help politicians get elected I think it's something like $6 billion dollar a year goes to this group of people whose job is to be you know marketing machines for for political purposes and when something works they you know the incentive is to go tell the world how genius you are and how it was your tactic that was the thing that worked and when it doesn't work it's like uh politician had no Charisma nothing we could do there right they they they need to deflect in order for to survive when you were writing your book which is called the victory lab did you I guess like how did you get around that bias like how could you figure out how open were these people in Sharing what's actually working not and did you have to kind of like read between the lines to try to figure out where are they just sort of grabbing extra credit versus what actually happened yeah it's one of the most um difficult things reporting in this area so you know I I was fortunate that I reported this book between election Cycles if you go in right now and you ask the Harris campaign or the Trump campaign or the super PC's working for them you know show me exactly how you're you're testing your ads on on online platforms they are the maybe they will tell you some stuff they very select will leak out stuff if they think it'll help them raise money usually so you'll read a story and wired one story and wired that's like inside comma ais's ad testing machine and details are very carefully selected over the course of you know during the campaign to give out to one piece that then they can send out when they go out when she goes to do a fundraising tour you know in Palo Alto that can convince you know a bunch of of tech Executives that that she's running a smart campaign so during a campaign though it's very difficult to get real details on what they're doing they don't want to the value of impressing their donors is up against not wanting to you know give away any anything to the competition right but after election day the campaign basically ceases to exist so everybody is on to another job a lot of them are you know looking for work or be or returned to their consulting firms or starting new firms developed some trick or tool during the campaign isn't there like some conference where they all go to like some uh some beach resort area where they go and they all get drunk and start talking yeah I mean so there there's like a post-election sort of conference circuit where Democrats and Republicans come together to um to kind of trade notes but they they need to launch a business I mean it's basically like every two years there's like a new sort of window for startups and and especially every four years and so there's a window where they go from being afraid that they will get fired if they T to a reporter because if you were caught leaking even the most minor thing inside a campaign that is you know fireable immediately fireable offense because they don't want anybody but the spokesman or the candidate talking for them and then two days later they are trying to figure out what they're going to do with the rest of everybody in the campaign is and so they're starting to take credit for everything they did so you know I I remember in 2012 you had this um the Obama analytics Department which is really pioneering out that they had like 52 54 people and this analex Brown which at the time was huge they called it the cave and these guys you know I I was reporting throughout the year for slate at that point and and was able to eek out bits of of of news over the course of the campaign through really judicious reporting and I would hear stories about the campaign manager summoning people on the analytics Department into his office to say did you talk to Sasha because you know there were some inquest to find like it was pretty sad and then the day after you know a whole bunch of them basically we're getting Eric Schmidt to um launch a firm for them and we're out giving interviews to everybody who wanted and taking credit for a whole bunch of things that probably were not theirs alone to take credit for and and and and the issue with that campaign is it has a binary outcome right one candidate wins and the other one loses and no one thing ever shapes that outcome not traditional things like you know what whatever happens on Tuesday it did not happen because one of the candidates chose the right vice presidential were not it did not happen just because of it just because you know Harris had a better debate performance than trump it did not happen just because turnout was up in Pennsylvania and down in Nevada it was a Confluence of dozens hundreds of big and small things and it's it's a storytelling exercise to see who can basically tell the most convincing story about why the election turn out the way it did and there political actors who want to tell that story right like moderates in the Democratic party of K Harris wi will say because she took moderate positions on this and that but there are people who from a sort of technical tactical perspective want to will want to say it's because the tv ads are really persuasive or it's because our social media strategy was so good and you need a good [ __ ] meter and you know and then the best way to do that is just really be alert to everybody's incentives for telling certain types of stories and be skeptical of of of the times where people have a a real obviously transparent agenda and I think I and I think you know from a ERS viewers perspective be a be wary of any sort of monocausal explanation for anything in in electoral politics no one thing did anything right it's well I do think it's fascinating that you you know when you're talking about the behavioral change aspect um one of the great things any entrepreneur could do is sort of learn from adjacencies and so basically saying hey if we want to win in politics we could do things that have worked in politics but maybe there's things that have worked in the business world or you know chelini wrote that book you know about persuasion not for politics at all but you could use things like that I mean it's like the way you describe that kind of like hey voter history is public here's yours um and here's your neighbors and we'll be sending an update later that's Elf on the Shelf right that's that's hey the elf is watching and he's going to tell Santa if you've been naughty or nice it's as simple as that I don't need to explain the virtues and why you should be naughty or it's just very simple uh somebody's watching and and I think that that's a very powerful thing I also found it interesting because what we traditionally hear if you just go turn on the news you turn on CNN you're going to hear a talking head explaining they're going to be talking about certain stories and they're going to be they're goingon to bring on some expert pundit who's going to tell you about how this thing that the vice president said during the you know convention and how that has this huge ripple effect but it's actually just the most recent thing that happened yeah and one thing I found fascinating was the story that you wrote about Biden's 2020 campaign and you talk in the in the article you wrote about uh they realized that they were flush with cash U they were going to have more funding than they they were going to have more funding not less funding than what they needed and so I guess the campaign manager or somebody was you know asked somebody on their team they go if you had an extra 10 million to spend to have the highest impact where would you spend it and there was this idea about misinformation and the as Biden called it the Malarkey Factory and um I thought this was pretty fascinating can you talk a little bit about the Malarkey Factory and specifically this IDE a of the harm index if you remember that I can I can kind of prompt you what I found fascinating there so you know I think that in in in 2020 there was um the campaign called it disinformation but I think really to to step back like they were trying to understand this new viral media environment so you know if you go back just eight 10 years in in politics campaign uh operatives would track communication by you could get a record of all the tv ads that are bought um by by can you could see all of them there services that will that will record and um uh uh allow you to access them digitally um uh you can see all your opponents campaign Finance reports so you have a pretty good sense of where they're getting money and how they're spending it um but you can have a you and and you can read the Press coverage or or see what's on the news you had a pretty good idea where voters were getting their information what the internet had changed is now like basically anybody had the ability to launch um a story and some of these get called disinformation because they're they're clear transparently but for for political operatives the real thing was like stuff's moving that we don't know where it came from or where it's going and and and what the motives of the people behind it are right because it's not coming from our opponent like we know what our opponent's trying to accomplish that they have the same brain we do but if this is like Macedonian teenagers who are trying to gain like uh online clicks for for ad revenue or this is a foreign intelligence service or this is somebody like in their basement doing it for for the laughs like we don't we can game out like what they're saying stories are going viral it could have an impact and we don't know who or why it's it's but who's behind it yeah and so the initial impulse was don't you know you you'd have all these sort of lessons from the old world kind of media consult like don't let it an attack go unanswered right always be on offense um and like yeah that makes sense if your opponent is attacking you on what you know is one of their big themes but if like somebody in in Saskatchewan is making something up about you to impress their friends maybe you shouldn't respond and maybe you can make the problem a whole lot worse by responding right um you elevate it you can you can end up engagement uh uh algorithms can end up can end up helping spread it by you trying to fact check it and so the binding campaigns mentality was let's shift from thinking about this as a supply side problem which is thinking individual bits of content that are coming out every day and deciding how and when to respond to them and basically as they said playing whacka all with like whatever the new thing that was trending that day and let's think of this more as a demand side problem the the most of the stuff we probably don't need to respond to it's not actually going to change voters opinions but the stuff that we do need to respond to the campaign said is the stuff that that meets existing anxieties that voters have about Biden or about Harris or about certain issues and so let's pre preemptively try to understand which viral narratives would be most damaging to the campaign would do the most harm so that when they pop up on a given day we have a framework for not overreacting or or reacting to the wrong one hey let's take a quick break to talk about AI we all know AI big deal um you see demos all the time of people doing really cool things but as a business owner sometimes it's hard to figure out how do I actually use this what do I actually do I've been trying to use it across all my businesses you know things like making little protype websites without needing to hire a coder or writing copy for our website or I give it a bunch of data and I ask it to analyze it for me it's been kind of amazing but the thing I always need is inspiration I know the tool can do a lot but it can almost do so much that I'm not really sure what I should actually be doing with it and so that's why I think it's great that HubSpot has created a report where they surveyed 2,000 Global Marketing leaders and asked them what's separating the high growth and low growth businesses and what strategies they're using with AI in their business you can grab these strategies and apply them to your own business for free the link is in the description below so this was the harm index that was the the idea there yeah that's what this big survey over the course of the summer of of um of 2020 and they and they took a lot of storylines some based in truth and and and a lot based in in uh some version of Lies um that they targeted the ticket so they you know and they would ask voters basically like three questions one are you familiar with this two uh does it uh do you think it's true and three do you um would it make you less likely to vote for Joe Biden that's that's very simple right three three three questions and they're doing this in person this is online how do they get this this was online this was online panel testing I think that they did and they would just show them a headline right they'd be like hun byop corruption right so yes so the hunter Biden corruption stuff this was before the laptop I think but you know Trump had already been impeached about trying to draw attention to his Ukraine ties a lot of people said that they were familiar with this Hunter bid Stu not that many people said that it would actually make them less likely to to vote for Joe Biden and then they did focus groups and it came out that people people did not think that Biden was fundamentally driven by his personal financial pain and so they might have thought it was they might have been familiar with it they might have even thought that there was some truth to it but it didn't really change the way that they thought about Biden on a core issue however the stuff related to his age and his mental infirmity that stuff obviously a lot of people knew about it um and at the same time though a lot of persuadable Voters said it would make them less likely to vote for Biden and the focus groups revealed that it wasn't that they were actually this wasn't new the campaign that they find had an age problem in 2020 um and the way that the communication staff on the campaign had dealt with this thus far was they would set up like photo ops of him him bicycling or like tell him to jog up the stairs to his plane right and and what came back from the focus groups was like this was all voters were not worried about uh his physical well-being they weren't concerned like that he wasn't going to get his steps in in the White House they were they saw him as a fundamentally weak political figure I think a lot of this had to do with being defined as vice president he was like he won the he won the primaries he's never the main character of that race and there were a lot of Voters who said basically like I kind of like the guy but I don't really know what he cares about or what he wants to do or who he's going to listen to and that manifest it it wasn't it was about his political weakness but it manifest itself in being susceptible to questions being raised about his physical condition and mental condition and so what the the way the campaign responded to those was first they went out and they started buying ads in places where people who would be exposed to that type of content persuadable voters who would be Expos that type of content work so there have been this effort on the left for a while to to to boycott Fox news and Breitbart websites um the Biden campaign said no we're buying advertising there because we want to get next to the content that people are seeing too they bought like Search terms so if you typed in you know Biden and scile or something you you would probably get cookied and shown like a YouTube pre-roll ad and they were things that if you were modeled as one of the persuadable voters who was sensitive on this age thing you would get targeted but you would not have any idea that it was about his age the most successful ad that they tested to these people was 15 seconds of Biden to camera just talking about like I grew up in Strand and I have middle class values and that's why I want to you know cut taxes on middle class people and raise them on the rich or something like really banal because all the research suggested that these people just wanted to hear him in his own voice saying what he cared about and what he would do that's the people who who were who could be turned off by the attack by claims that he was scile just wanted to hear that like he could articulate his basic his basic world view right in in a firm Voice direct to camera not edited like you know and and they were suspicious of of things that looked too glossy or too slick um and so there was a sort of push away from kind of the traditional Aesthetics and political advertising right like a lot of like here's a headline and here's a thing and here's a cut and here's some whoosh and and here's and here's some stock footage of farmers know eating ice cream and like no it's like really something that very clearly looked unedited um because the because the people who were sort of open to this were were ones who were sort of innat suspicious of political communication right right and so this idea of they took the stories and they're like you have the Sleepy Joe's stories you got the creepy Joe's stories you got the hunter Biden stories test it on people figure out three questions have you heard about this do you think it's true and is just going to like you know make you less likely to vote for for for Biden super simple and then basically counter figuring out what is the counterprogramming message at first they thought hey show I'm on a bike that counters the Sleepy Joe message I think they had this score where on the x-axis was like number of people who are aware of it on the y axis it's like how much it's going to impact their vote so they they could just have a board that showed all the issues it's like oh a lot of people are aware about this Hunter Biden thing but it's not not effective their vote low harm score a 25 harm score and then yeah I I ski Mar Sean because like I think the first role of podcasting is describe charts people love [Music] that the x-axis was the reach so Haron de the x-axis was the reach right how many people had heard about it right and the Y AIS was what the influence impact yeah you know impact and so you know and basically the the campaign's thinking tactically on This was um if it's in the bottom if it's on the left of this thing we don't need to worry about it if it has high impact but low reach let's keep an eye on it because if it spreads if it makes the jump out of like some corner of fortun to to you know mass media or you know getting to normal people on Facebook then we will have a problem so let's be prepared and then the stuff in the upper right hand corner it it's reaching the voters we care about and it'll change their opinions like that's where we need to act right right what about um Trump so you wrote that book in 2012 I think 2011 2012 time yeah so then this guy who is you know this person this TV personality comes from the business world not a politician at all runs his campaign I think he even has admitted that like it wasn't like he didn't think he was going to win initially and therefore he talked about like yeah I didn't really have a plan because like you know nobody thought we would win we just thought we were doing our best and then when we got when we won I had to figure out the plan on day one what do you when when you look at that that what do you see do you see this kind of like Master marketer do you just see this anomaly do you did he use the normal Playbook was did he throw out the normal Playbook what did what did Trump do so Trump in 2016 what he did in the conventional sense was the big the big shift was he went from an a TV dominated campaign for paid advertising he obviously dominated TV almost every day of the year in terms of free media coverage but his budget um which is much smaller than Hillary Clinton's was typically there's a lot sided indifference between TV spending and digital spending and and and also by direct mail and some of the the non-digital tools and I think he had he had like half the money which is like unheard of the only place where you might see that these days as like a city council candidate in a place where it's too expensive to buy television and all they can do is is you know spend $40,000 on Facebook ads right you never see highlevel campaigns of any size that are that are at parody of those two and the reason Trump spent was ready to spend money online starting uh in real way starting in the spring of 2016 was that Jared Kushner came to him and convinced him that this what Trump is doesn't like spending money um and he's you know hates CLA also doesn't use a computer so this is kind of amazing like did you see this clip that's going viral right now of him sitting they're watching kamla's speech have you seen this clip it's a it's from some I think there's like a doumentary I guess there like a clip from it and so it's called The Art of the surge I'm not sure if it's okay yeah and so he's sitting next to this blonde woman I don't know who she is and he's literally like orating his tweets so he sees Kus say something on TV and then he goes no way we're GNA let that happen exclamation point not on my watch send and then she's typing and she says and he just does like 16 of those in like this like clip cuz people never knew like wait this guy doesn't use a computer is he even behind his social and they showed him doing that which is hilarious at that point he' had a he had a Twitter account for 5 years and and and he understood that to be a big part of his celebrity and ability to drive traditional news coverage but spending real money on on Facebook ads not just on you know self-made content and hoping it it spreads organically that came because because Jared kusher came to him and convinced him that instead of all the other things in the campaign where Consultants are begging you to spend money and it goes out the door that you could make this a revenue Center Fun by through for for fundraising so typically TV ads you you pay the money to try to change people's opinion and you hope you get votes afterwards if you buy ads you and you target them well and you have people who want to give you money you can obviously this is why Charities do online fundraising and stuff um and so Trump started spending real money on Facebook because he was seeing a return on it and that resonated to him it was it was the it was the you know it was economic motive fundamentally more than it was was part of a political strategy and what he ended up doing um in by the combination of his organic ability to draw attention um online in ways that that traditional politicians couldn't and the fact that they were um amplifying and catalyzing it through through what ended up being eventually some some real paid spending mostly on Facebook advertising but also a little bit on other platforms he was able to create a community online that was you know really deep and meaningful and to the people who are part of it and you know I think that we thought at the time you know the idea was that Obama was the great digital era politician because he had he had developed the best you know the best and biggest lists that was the measure in in 2016 the measure of a successful online politician was how many signups how many email addresses do you have how many people have given you their cell phone number and opted into letting you text them how many people followed you on platforms and that basically was supporters that you can now communicate with for free right that that's all all that all that represents is you no longer have to pay to advertise to them they have have have given you the information and authorization to talk to them and but what did Obama do with that these tens of millions of supporters who had had chosen to to um sign on in some way he basically asked them to give money and occasionally to volunteer take some action um but it was very transactional it was very one-sided and what we realized in retrospect and that was true basically every politician in the United States till Trump came along and what Trump did mostly by Instinct not by any strategy or I think great abstract conception of like how to communicate digitally because just because he gets it in a in a animalistic way was that you should like a poster does right and that means Obama never like re Amplified his retweeted or shared his his supporters content why because if you're the Obama campaign in 2012 you spent hundreds of millions of dollars on opinion research polling focus groups other qualitative research testing your ads and your mail you have come down at that point you have come to to the to the syllable on what you want to say on which issues when to whom how and the whole campaign is this command and control exercise to make sure that you saying the exact right thing at the exact same time at the right time to to all the right people so the idea that you would take your most enthusiastic supporter who's tweeting at you all day and just like share with your followers is so antithetical to the way that political professionals think about the best way to communicate and Trump does it because he does it impulsively haha that's funny let's share it right um and what he did was he created a community of people who were invested who felt like they were part of the campaign and they ended up you know the whole meme culture around him the online magga community is is is a I think a far more satisfying satisfying place for its members to reside online because they get all this reinforcement from likeminded people that Obama or Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden never gave even if they collected a lot of names of people who ended up giving them money online right and that is that is a gift that I have not seen we've seen politicians and get some part of that for some period of time Bernie Sanders had some of that whatever else but there's you know still the idea you have to relinquish a certain amount of control over your Communications and there are very few politicians who who are willing to do that that is fascinating to me that I did not know the the story there of Kushner coming in and basically like changing the frame from we spend money to try to buy votes versus we spend money to rake in more money and then that $1 becomes two that two becomes three and three becomes four that we can just continue to fund raise this way and then and and ultimately if somebody's giving you their money they're probably also going to give you their vote right so it's not like you're only doing one versus the other campaigns have always had a very clear divide both in terms of like the or chart within the headquarters in terms of the budget be and in terms of what you say and where and some of it's because of regulations around around political spending but like fundraising communication is a very different Beast inside of campaign than persuasion or or get out the vote communication right and totally different offices in the campaign but like what Trump I think sort of just naturally found out was if you're spending a lot of money prospecting on Facebook telling people why you're great um some of that will go to people who will end up chipping in 10 bucks and signing up for a recurring payment right some of it will also will go in front of people whose opinions you are helping to shape some of it will go help turn people already support you into volunteers by getting them and that campaigns did not typically think that that they thought of it as we're having we have our fundraising targets we have our who almost by definition are not your persuasion targets because your persuasion targets are people whose Minds aren't made up your fundraising targets are people who already support you and you're trying to get them to give more yes yes um okay so I like that and it seems like you know Trump is just kind of blend of uh celebr he's like an influencer brand right in the same way that you know Kylie Jen you know Kylie Jenner can sell you know makeup better than uh than an a makeup brand that doesn't have an influencer or that you know George Clooney can sell alcohol or you know Ryan Reynolds can go sell cell phone service through met mobile it seems like the ads using Trump worked and it sounds like you've also kind of pointed out that he created a bit of a community whereas like I can't even really tell you what is Comm like I I could tell you Trump's Community which is the Maga movement and kind of know who they are what they look like what they what they stand for and what they're all about I don't even know what the name of the community would be for kamla like it would only be people who hate Trump I think is the only answer there was a little bit of they call themselves the kive um uh of like a little cluster of of Comm supporters but that campaign did not last long for a reason which is I don't think that there was a particularly broad-based um enthusiasm for her never met a lot of kivs and she has been at some disadvantage and there have been advantages to starting a campaign in July but a lot of disadvantages a lot of it is that you know audience online audience takes a long time to build and you know I I think that she I think there'll be an interesting conversation to have after the selection as to whether she will have had the shortest presidential campaign in modern American history by far right I mean that the General tendency has been towards these two-year campaigns and she's going to have a four month uh campaign well she's done a couple things well right she raised a lot of money very quickly she she's outraised Trump she's also I've you know her Tik Tok when she started she you know picked a medium and it seems like they were picking alternative medium so you know Trump has done a lot of podcasts she's done a couple but podcast seems to be a bigger part of the equation this this time she went super viral on Tik Tok right away and they had a bunch of songs and little earworms like you know JD Vance's you know I'm a never Trump Guy song that that that was great you know they've done a bunch of things like that um you know when he said the thing about eating the dogs eating the cats you know within minutes it's viral on Tik Tok as a song that somebody remixed and so I think they've done a lot of interesting things there does any of that stand out to you do you have opinions on any of that I'm curious how you look at that um you know I think one one other thing that they did which is pretty novel is that they have gotten into the like clipping and amplifying little bits of every Crazy Little Thing That Trump says I mean there was this school of thought among Democrats it was pretty prevailing I think for for uh most of Trump's which is don't give him oxygen don't give him exposure you're only feeding the whatever and uh they would scull journalists who are like why are you taking his speeches live and why are you guys sharing clips of everything he says and now go to the C kamla HQ account and it will be it's like those guys you know the Media Matters guys or whatever else who are just clipping like all these Wild Things that that that go on Fox News just the 7 seconds he said that you know you can electrocute yourself with a with a car on the moon or something and like look at this crazy old guy and that's a very different mentality about how to go with Trump in particular than Democrats had and so you know I think that they they feel like they've the the digital team in in The Campaign which is basically inherited entirely from the Biden campaign they feel a little Unshackled they have much more to work with I think that there was you know um obvious viously they have a a candidate who's more Dynamic and and closer to pop culture they have more celebrities who are eager to be Associated uh with the campaign they also you know I think that there was a a sense that Biden um so emphasize like the Dignity of the office and Trump is beneath this that there was a sense of like let's not get down in the mud and and play Trump's game and and um I think that there's a real freedom to do kind of name calling and stuff that that the Biden people would have is are a pettier than their brand um you know and so so yeah I think that they've been far more willing to mix it up in online um I I I do think though this is an area where she probably you know and engage with influencers and such but if she'd had an extra year to cultivate those relationships online some of that would be showing fruit now in a way that they've just been you know scrambling to I mean they were doing things in August that campaigns are usually doing the previous March like you know designing a logo right I mean like really like day one type type things you've studied un covered elections for like more than 15 years I think who do you think is running the better campaign right now not who's going to win but who's running a better campaign I thought Trump for most of the year was running as good a campaign as he could run now I start to see a real mismatch between what they claim as their strategy and and the organization that they have been building for it which is you know in short so much of the Trump plan seems to be based on mobilizing young men especially young men of color um uh and there re there's reasons in polling to suggest that there's real room for for him to gain in a way that that few Republicans have there but the you know that's that's this job of basically going to people who are not voters and turning them into voters and all the research I've written about suggest that you know the best way to do that is high quality face-to-face interactions uh from a volunteer between a volunteer from a voter's community and them to to have these sort of socially meaningful interactions to give them really practical advice like you know where's your polling place and and and and all of that stuff and the campaign has made a decision to effectively Outsource a lot of that you know what people call Ground game or field organization but the real boots on the ground part of campaigning to America pack which is the Elon Musk uh funded super pack and typically the division of labor on campaigns has been that that sort of nuts and bolts labor intensive work that does not scale up easily right it you know that going from a 100 people in West Philadelphia knocking on doors to 200 people knocking on doors in West Philadelphia takes twice as much work in capital going from 100 ads on TV in Pennsylvania to the same ads running twice as often takes basically no more effort and so the way that there's been this big question for about 15 years about how do you divide responsibilities between campaigns and the super Pacs outside different sets of rules different advantages for eaching them and typically the way it's broken down is the campaigns and the party committees will do that labor intensive work that doesn't scale up and the money on the outside will basically buy ads mostly TV some digital that amplify the message because they can't coordinate with one another directly the the Trump people blown up that model and they're now trusting this outside group that that musk runs to do this door knocking thing what is he doing because I actually haven't followed it fully I saw he's going Mr Beast he's giving away a million dollars a day I I don't even understand what that is can you explain that what is Elon doing so he's paying people to get their friends to sign petitions so you can like in a $47 Bounty or something if you can get your friend to sign a I that says like I believe in the first and second amendment and give your information um and what is that why why that I can come up with a few theories of what they could do with that information but it seems like a pretty roundabout way to get information that's already available like there's already a database of every voter in the state and if I wanted to know people in Pennsylvania who care about uh you know who are conservative or you know or magga or and own a gun like that's a combination of publicly available or viable information I shouldn't have to pay people to go collect it from their neighbors um uh and so it seems like a tactic you would use that's far better if you're trying to have a long-term movement organization building thing which does I haven't seen any indication that that Elon Musk is trying to build a a generational movement here um it does not seem like a particularly effective way to to to get people to to vote for the first time or the second time in their in their lives so that's one big part of what they're doing then they're doing just a lot of basically hiring day laborers to go knock on doors and there's been a bunch of reporting wir had some good reporting uh Daily Beast I think on it's like it is in any industry hiring people off the street and and paying them by the hour or or um or prob contact UM leads to a lot of bad work and you have a lot of really poor incentives for people to either be inefficient or or give you bad data if you're if you're if you're paying them uh uh per complete so I I I've sort of shifted my view on the competence of the the the Trump organization uh over the course of years because it seems like they've they've they haven't aligned their strategy with their their tactics and and organization and I think com Harris is running a far more traditional democratic campaign and there's a a kind of more sensible logic to it even if if she's made a few mistakes along the way it sounded like the thing you 's doing um you know he's trying to sign you can't pay people to vote that's illegal so it's kind of like I'll pay you to sign the petition and the petition says something that sounds very like agreeable like I I support Free Speech yeah who doesn't right like that sound sounds pretty reasonable but like seems like there must be some some 3D chess going on that I'm not I don't fully understand which is what what do you do after that what's the point of that yeah I mean if if you use that information and then you have a really good operation to call those people maybe Target them with digital advertising call them and knock on their door and say I know you're a first and second amendment voter and you signed a petition devoting yourself to the cause now do this and this like there's actually a reason to think that works but that's just then one step that's just the first step in a three or four step process and you need to be really good and targeted at the next few steps because you know one real difference that's important I think for for your audience to keep in mind when you um learning from adjacent Fields is is great and important a lot of the breakthroughs I've written about have come from people in politics looking to to business or elsewhere but there's some really difference really important differences between business marketing and political marketing and one of them is that the cost of a of mistargeting out of a false positive in your modeling is really high in politics right so if you are if you have a consumer product and your Coke and you put a Coke ad in front of somebody who's on a diet or doesn't like sugar has diabetes or like whatever okay you wasted 10 cents for that person big deal if you are the Trump campaign and you send a door kner to do a get out the vote reminder to somebody who is your data tells you is should be a trump supporter but they're not um or there's one Trump supporter in that house but you remind three other people the three women living with that TR one Trump supporter that it's election day on Tuesday too and it makes them more likely to vote or your person's just kind of inefficient you know like lazy and they knock on the wrong door in the apartment complex and may end up going to the to the Harris supporter and reminding them you've not only you haven't just wasted that interaction you've created a vote for your opponent there is nothing the only thing like that in the marketing world where there's that cost to uh misidentifying your targets is maybe an insurance or or or credit cards where if if a company thinks that they can extend you a $110,000 credit limit and you're not good for it they made a big mistake right if an if an insurer decides that you that you're you know should be a $500 premium and it turns out that you cost them a lot more they've really SC screwed up but most consumer marketing like there's not a huge downside to getting your message in front of the wrong people but politics there is and I think well that's the big mistake that a lot of people and perhaps Elon or the people around him make is they move from business to politics they say let's just throw resources at it when I needed to when I needed to build you know create interest in Tesla I just bombarded all these people dig advertising about Tesla or offered them all a free test drive and you know a cocktail in our at our at our cool um uh uh showrooms like that probably works to start building interest in Tesla it's a terrible way to to to try to turn out voters for your candidate and when you've been looking into a space like this like how disillusion do you get and really I guess the question is you've now studied multiple election Cycles you've heard you've talked to the teams behind this and then the different subsections of this industry what's like you know when I clean my house and I move the couch and I'm like oh my God there's 10 years of my kids snacks under here like what's the thing where you're like I wish I didn't see that I wish I didn't know that what what is the ugliest part of this that that really has you know you you saw or turns you off I mean I think the the disinformation stuff is is you know I generally was encouraged in the early years of writing about this cuz the people who were at The Cutting Edge of using this data and experiment were generally in the business of trying to get more people to vote or giving voters information that was more relevant to them and that struck me as like democracy was was improving because of technology and Innovation um uh if I use campaigns have a lot of data about individual voters that doesn't really scare me a lot of people have a lot of data about voters and are usually instead of giving you some vague thing about you know morning in America if I if I think that you're likely to care a lot about about um you know cancer research and I give you a more targeted message about what I my campaign would do for cancer research like I think that that's generally good for the country what what has changed is I think you have so many people have the ability to reach large numbers of Voters now who are just not constrained by a lot of the expectations about honesty and can't be held accountable for what they say and and I think that that that is is is scary to me what's going on now because AI has now made it easy to do deep faked audio I can make I can make it I can make Donald Trump say anything for like you know 30 cents on my computer right now I can make a video that shows you know something that I want happening um I could have if hey if uh if phone banking works why can't I just spin up an army of AI phone agents to just call everybody what is what have you seen as the new tools and is that has that happened this cycle or you think it's next cycle relatively maybe less the cycle than I would have thought if we'd had this conversation a year ago um you know I think the campaigns this is a place there were some campaigns that wanted to be first because they realized they' get a lot of attention and and um and wanted that but I think most campaigns are afraid of the backlash of of um being associated with with AI even for not necessarily even from for manipulation but just like you know Auto non-live callers and and so I think that there's a hurdle that that campaigns have from a kind of brand image perspective about being associated with with new or potentially sort of invasive feeling Technologies um and so there's been less of that where people are using AI the most in this campaign is like sort of the same way we all might use it which is like brainstorming first drafts of of fundraising emails you know like most fundraising emails they need to come up with new ones every day to send to people right they'll basically use the same types of of uh themes and and and messages is you're probably going to e test them anyway so instead of having a bunch of you know 23 year olds who just you know graduated from Lial arts colleges like typing out your first drafts and trying to see whether the the one that scares people into thinking you're losing is going to do better than the one that has like JLo's signature under it why not have the machine come up with 10 different JLo ones and test those and that's I think like probably that the the most we're seeing um AI or automation being used in this campaign but I think obviously that'll change over the next few years right um why are why is comla doing like a a fortnite map they just released like a they're basically like advertising in video games which I think others have done in the past but I mean those people aren't even old enough to vote I think the average fortnite player what's the psychology around that so it starts from the position of having more money than they know what to do with and they're being an unusual scarcity issue for political marketers which is like one you have one day by which all your sales have to be completed I don't think there's another industry I mean there seasonal Industries I guess like a July 4th fireworks store Bic right so like um Halloween store probably make some interesting pricing decisions on November 1 right um so one thing is that they like have a lot of money they have to get out the door and all of the TV is bought up in you know we're down to seven Battleground States the TV markets are saturated there's a point at which you can no longer send out new direct mail um if you wanted to get more volunteers knocking on doors you probably had to start building offices and having staff to train them months ago and so at the end of The Campaign you start to see uh the end of this you know right before election Daye you start to see campaigns making decisions that are driven less by efficient like overall efficiency and more by basically where can we very quickly Park some money and and I think that that um you know that that's when you start to see like sound trucks and stuff like that because there's nowhere else to put it so some people called this election the the sort of the the the podcast election because you have podcasts have become this huge medium you have unedited unfiltered conversations kind of one of the only ways you can actually see what a candidate is really like I was joking with my buddy I said I think going on Theo Von's podcast should be a new um Federal standard for presidents I just need to know if my president's a good hang or not yeah and theovon might be the only guy who could save us there um you know Trump did Rogan JD Vance just did a three-hour thing with Rogan and famously kamla and you know Rogan said hey you can come out to Austin and let's do you know two three hours un unedited in my studio she said no um there's two reactions to that one was wow what a dropped ball you could have got in front of 30 million people in a like super meaningful way another was how dare you Joe she's the vice president and there's a few days left before the election how dare you have demands you should be you know crawling to her to do this um and other people would say you're not going to convince anybody who listens to Rogan to vote for you for for Kamala anyways what do you think about the role of podcast and was it a mistake for Kamala to not go on Rogan I think that her campaign um was slow to put her out in a lot of different venues you know there was that week where she did call uh uh Daddy and and the view and it was like oh to co be Tim or something was like oh she's doing media now and right part of what was shocking about that was that she was doing so little of it early on and like again they had to build a campaign from scratch really quickly at a at an inopportune Point she had to pick a VP she had to get ready for you know a nomination speech debates all the stuff that she did not expect she was going to have to do a few weeks earlier so um but also you know one of the advantages that Democrats had in in dumping Biden from the ticket and getting her was you had somebody who first of all to send more energy in theory she can like work a full day and do a bunch of things that Biden isn't expect to do the other thing is she's more Dynamic and she's you know more in tune with pop culture and I think there was some sense that wow Democrats are going to go from somebody who does like three rallies a week and his his staff is afraid to put in you know on like Face the Nation not even F Von like just somebody who can do five events a day and interviews Non-Stop and she's charismatic and and and intellic and all these things and that never really came to fruition and I don't know how much this I think might be one of the things we start to learn after the election when when some journalists or book authors get a little access into what they were thinking I think one of the questions is how much of that was just that they didn't have the time to do as much of it and and that would be could be sensible to me um the other or was it that the staff was fundamentally afraid that downside of going into an unstructured two hours with Joe Rogan offsets the the upside of of of getting in front of that audience can you give me a couple minutes on your new book so you got this new book out what's the what's the premise and then can you give me maybe one of the juicy findings or learnings uh or stories that you had from it yeah so it's about this sort of New Era we've we've we've bounced in and out of this but the new asymmetry that's created when in this digital environment where campaigns realize that their opposition is is not their opponent it's not another candidate or party it it it could be you know the foreign intelligence service or somebody who's you know attacking you for shits and giggles or or who knows what and and how sort of what the the search for a playbook for for learning how to communicate in that environment because it blows up so many of the expectations about about campaign strategies and I write a bit about that Biden uh uh example in there which I think was really a really important shift in starting to think about the recipients of disinformation more than the producers of disinformation which has been I think a big mistake that that not just campaigns with people in the media make and trying to understand what impact only will have I also read about a really interesting group called we defend truth that um this this uh it's a progressive group that uh has been trying to fight basically conspiracy theories um around the 2020 election around around covid vaccines they basically have gone out and hired some of the more successful like and meme makers online um uh you know the guy who had like the most likes on imar and stuff and their their theory of the case is that you need to be engaging in the in the in the vernacular of the internet meme Warfare you have to you have to fight memes with memes you have to fight memes with me you need and you need to be communicating in the way that that online audiences expect to be communicated to which means be coarse and be and be funny and you know be kind of in the pop culture com ation do not feel like political communication do not feel like marketing um and you know I I I quote one of their um the sort of head guy there he says like you need to earn the right to communicate with people and to do that you have to usually entertain or inform them first and I think it's a really interesting way of starting to think about how traditional political communication has to fundamentally rethink itself from the oneway broadcast Dynamic that a lot of the modern um uh thinking about campaigning was shaped into the kind of you know two-way or or multi-linear sort of environment that of of social media it reminds me of like when you had TV and movies were like the dominant video like media and if you were making a TV show you could afford to spend the first few minutes if you watch the first couple minutes of a TV show it'll be like the scene starts in New York a guy's walking we don't know who he is or what he's doing and then there's this harmless scene and then it finally like you get to the characters and the story if you ever watch a Tik Tok or a YouTube video like in the first 5 Seconds they're doing something to tell you do not click away stay on this video you got to watch this video like I hang out with Mr Beast and he's like he could recite to me the first 40 seconds of of script from a video he did three years ago because he drilled it so many times and every word was chosen of like I cannot like leave this first minute up for grabs right and what he talks about because I asked him I said you know do you ever look at TV and what you could learn from them and he goes yeah but what they could learn from us mean he's like dude TV would never survive uh on YouTube right you he's like people would click away it have terrible retention rates terrible clickthrough rates they couldn't survive in our world and so similarly what you're talking about is in the old world where it's my message versus the other candidates message and it's just those two it's a one V one um you know there's one Playbook and now you're saying you're just playing the field there's field of the internet where there's stories and information coming from all kinds of different people with all levels of accuracy and different levels of impact how are you going to respond to not a One V one but sort of you versus the entire field of content that's out there right now and what's your playbook to win there yeah absolutely and I think we're only now starting to get you know people have campaigns having a more instinctual understanding it used to be so much of online campaigning you know in the 2000s 2010s was Bas let's take things we're already doing offline and figure out how to move them online right okay so we know how to make 30 second videos and put them on TV let's just turn them into you know maybe we have to go from vertical horizontal to vertical or whatever but let's just figure out how to get them onto onto social media platforms can we can we do something online that looks can we basically take our Direct Mail program out of the the the USPS and put it into email and now I think we're starting to get people in politics some of it's a generational shift some of it's Democrats realizing how poorly they've been out foxed on online during the Trump era to started like we need to really step back and rethink some of these foundational questions of how and why you communicate to certain people I want to I want to leave with one last question which is uh what do you think is the most mispriced or misunderstood opportunity in elections meaning if somebody hired you and they're like all right you're going to you're a consultant um and you got to give them input to do something that maybe they're not already doing or maybe they're doing but not enough of where would you place a bet that you think has sort of more upside than people are currently um you know taking advantage of so less maybe not economic upside um but sort of political entrepreneurial upside would be in communicating with the voters outside of election cycles and um uh you know I think there's a great example now like the best I think we're if Trump wins this election we're going to look back and say arguably his best period was a period in 2021 2022 when he was largely out of the news Republicans were distancing themselves the media wasn't covering him Democrats had hoped he was gone and stopped attacking him and he was able to start to build up some sense of nostalgia for the Trump Years A lot of it like not based in a real understanding of what 2020 was like when he was president but have distance helped him and if Democrats had kept like a foot on his neck through advertising reminding people yes the reason you know wherever unemployment was and in and inflation were in 2021 was because of the guy who was just there reminding people about some of the co Dynamics but like they pulled away from him at just the moment that they Pro they could have um continued to Define him and I think there are a lot of reasons for that political money disappears out of cycle you only get the of interest in cycle but um there's sort people starting to talk about party-based branding right so like so much of our political our political communication paid Comm tv ads are almost entirely about candidates and yet like when we started this conversation was that basically 45% of of the country are Democrats and 45% are Republicans and they'll always vote for their party and yet no political advertising has spent branding the parties and I think they're advantages to do doing that in a counter cyclical way when people are not being bombarded by tons of TV ads but be reminding people the Republican Party stands for this and this here's how the Democrats screwed up last time or vice versa um and try to think about not just winning votes in an election but but sort of long-term audience building for for a party I like it uh maybe you could also be one of these these political uh consultant shops that are making bank what's what is the what is the business that stunned you how much it makes in the uh in this sort of election in this election marketing business is there any whether it's a polling company or a research company that like is there any like multi- hundred million dollar companies out there that do this the business model that's still most astounding is is uh media buyers who get paid a commission off of off of the ads they place when percent of AD ad percent of of AD spend and you know digital advertising is more labor intensive for them but buying TV is you know they're only so many stations in in Wisconsin that you could put ads on and you know it doesn't take any more work to double the buy and they get paid a commission off of in their you know that that that's and it's been that way for decades and is is is is there one like dominant ad buyer that that like there a handful on in each party but um and you know they're they're probably having Revenue in the some of them also make ads and so they're part of a bigger media business they're probably know probably in on the high end in the in hundred million Revenue range we're not talking about you know huge companies but um but it it really does not require at this point a lot of Savvy or or right or or or labor ad buyers one give me one more is there any other cool business that uh that is maybe it's like a oneman shop that makes you know 10 million a year just doing a specific thing or is there any other interesting business Niche that that you just stumbled into there's still some interesting stuff to be done with d data and modeling um especially you know there are a lot of sort of Boutique firms that will do campaign specific modeling but what's happening now is that the things that presidential campaigns were able to do only presidential campaigns were able to do maybe 12 years ago now somebody running for County Executive can use and I'm not sure that there are this is more an opportunity than people have mastered but I think that they're have probably opportunities to figure out how to package and translate that for smallscale campaign that do not have professionals always working on them the person running for State R in your neighborhood her brother might be like the effect facto campaign manager and whatever else and often the the Delta between what what a sort of engaged lay person trying to run a campaign can do and the sophistication of the tools and data available is just too much to Bridge and they don't do it but there probably is a way to to price those and and create tools that are more accessible that that's where I I think that's a place that if people were looking to try get into the sort of tech end of the political business there's there there's probably some opportunity very cool Sasha I appreciate you coming on and giving us extra time man this is fascinating thank you so much where should people find you send them to your book tell them what tell them what they need to know yeah my new book's called the LIE detectives and search of a playbook for winning elections in the disinformation age and I have a website Sasha Eisenberg so it's my first name and last name.com um you can find all my books there my my first one's about the global Sushi business which may be of interest to to to to you too so um it's been really fun I I love talking about politics from an angle that's different than one people are saying on CNN on any given day so thank you all right thanks so much man that was great [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right Sam I was going through the mailbag people email us questions and there was one that I had to had to bring up we got to start with this so here's the here's the here's the [Music] email dear Sam last month I sold my Ecom Biz and recently a startup that I invested went public I'm in my 30s I own very little house cars nothing I have 53 million in cas cash sitting in my bank account but I'm not sure what to do if I do something it needs to be big I'm torn between a few options just put it in the sp500 and move on getting into real estate trying private Equity chasing a billion dollar idea I've hit three major wins in a row I exited my company I invested a winning startup and I got really lucky on a real estate deal but I'm not entirely confident I can rebuild it from scratch if I lose it all my life goals are pretty simple have five kids a wife and become a billionaire I'm currently with someone I'm planning to marry what do you got for me okay so let's start let's answer this question and then there's some good other mailbag questions that we have here all right so let me tell you what I told the guy I basically said if you make $50 million at the age of 35 that basically becomes a billion eventually but that's kind of irrelevant but like I think that's a dumb goal to become a billionaire or want to become a billionaire I think you should do what you love after after you have that much money but if you want to become a billionaire you will but what I told him was basically I think he should put most of it actually into a high yield savings account or just like some type of like short-term treasury note or something like that and just sit for six to 12 months and do nothing except read and have conversations with interesting people and that actually six to 12 months that may take 36 months that might actually take five or 10 years but whatever you want to do I my opinion is you should plot and read and talk and only do something if you're obsessed with it and often times when you make a lot of money you get bored and because of that you start kind of it's like it's like falling in love with someone when you're like really horny it's like dude you don't actually love that person you know what I mean like don't don't actually do it and so I think but you have to be really intentional about what next project that you do and you don't give yourself a timeline but you sit and you read and you wait for it to happen so with the money I would do some type of high yield savings account for like six months and then eventually I would do 8020 S&P bonds I would try to live off 3% of that money and then I would just plot and wait until that one thing I find and then I would take a percentage of the money like for example let's say that you're comfortable living off of a $1.5 million a year you take how much you need in the S&P to live off that and the rest you are willing to allocate towards your big dream and new adventure all right I like the advice here's an analogy here's what I would tell this person do we have a name for this person they don't want their name out there let's call dere okay D all right Chuck here's the deal here's an analogy for you you got to beautiful big screen TV beautiful 96 in it's it's enormous beautiful plasma retina whatever the display is but it seems to me like behind the TV you have what a lot of us have you got the cables all tangled up and the reason I say this is because you asked one question that's actually five questions probably in one so let's separate out let's start to pull the tangles on these cables that are stuck behind the TV so one one cable is what do I do with this cach meaning I've got cash account should I just leave it there or do I do something with this money there's another one which is what do I do with my time and those are two separate questions because when you get rich the point of getting rich in a way is to separate the questions of what do I do with my money what do I do for money and what do I do with my time those are now separate questions for you but before when you have no money they're the same you work you put your time in that's how you get the money out then you have a third go third question which is what are my actual goals so he said my goals are to have five kids have a wife and have a billion dollars and have have have I don't know very many happy people who got happy because they they acquired things they have things they have cars the kid thing might be different I think you could acquire a kid and be happy actually I don't think so I think life is a lot more about uh figuring out what you love to do where you feel most useful and and who you want to become and more importantly than than the things that you end up doing so I I think I would I would ask a question which is what are my actual goals goals and I use the word actual as a loaded word because usually we have these goals that we just borrowed from others either from our parents from society from the movies from newspapers these goals that that are theirs and we make them ours it's a goal you had 10 years ago but you're not the same person you were 10 years ago when I did this episode of Mike poser he's like dude I was in my 20s all I wanted to do was get rich get famous be successful be respected he's like and then I was in my 30s I was doing things that would get me those things but that's not what I wanted anymore I was living the dreams of 21-year-old me rather than than 31y old me who actually had new dreams and I I needed to update that I needed to update the the sort of motivational thing on the on the poster there's another great question which is he says something like I if I'm doing something I it's got to be huge and uh anytime I hear that there's usually like a chip on your shoulder you probably want to work on a great question here is are you being D are you driven or are you being dragged uh so it's like what what's the reason why do I feel the need to do that is it to prove something to other people I talked to a guy who who uh we had dinner with a guy who's created a a $50 billion doll plus company he's doing a new one I was like why are you doing another company like stressful hard you just had kids why why are you doing this he goes I just want to prove you know I need to prove that like it wasn't just a fluke the first time really that's and in my head I'm laughing because I'm like proof to who you know nobody doubts that you could do this like we all actually respect and admire you we think you're amazing Who Who Are You proving this to is proving it to yourself why do you doubt it you did it then then doing it to prove something wrong or prove something right is is sort of a silly way a silly reason to do something so anyways my my final advice would be I would do nothing financially you know like you said just put in a savings account for for a year I would get a coach to help untangle some of these mental wires that are tangled up I would get in shape because when you're in shape all things start to look a little different and I would spend a year with people that you really love helping people and hanging out with them so I would find people who need help I'd go help them I'd find people who are free I'd go hang out with them and I would to hang out with people who maybe have gone through this season of life and I'd think of it like a season I'd be like oh I had this season of achievement and now I got a season of wandering but I got to figure out what I'm doing next call it that so you don't feel uncomfortable when you're like oh man I'm so unproductive Now call the season what it is and go hang out with people and and make no decisions until you know the clarity will show up the worst thing this person can do well one of the bad things this person could do is go and buy a bunch of stuff or um get himself into situations that can't easily be untied so for example I mostly followed my own advice when I kind of uh had an acquisition I did one dumb thing which is I bought some real estate that I was like going to turn into a business and I did it like right away and a few months into it I'm like I don't know what the hell I'm doing and I don't like this and it took it took like a year to like unwind all of that it consumed my brain and it really messed with me and so I uh I regret doing that and I think a lot of people make the same mistakes it's a very common mistake is to go and like acquire a whole bunch of stuff which weighs you down and it ruins the whole seeking process the the only alternative version of that is when you go and you do something for your parents so like uh there's a great clip we should put play this clip of you know who Stephen A Smith is the ESPN anchor he talks about when he first got money and he drives to his mom's where his mom worked and he's like I went into went into her office and I said Mom get up get your bag we're leaving and I told her boss she she ain't never coming back he talks about how he retired his mom on the spot and I was like that's a cool thing to do pay off your your parents mortgage or debt or something like that if you're gonna do anything do that it's a you know sort of a a philanthropy in your own economy first uh that that's I think that's that's what I did by the way we we I flew my parents first class to Europe and it was awesome um um it was awesome uh and I have this video of them my father stood up and like you know how old people hold their phone with two hands uh and he like is holding his phone like doing a circle of like and I and I like taking a picture of like his seat and I have a video of him doing that and that brought me so much um I feel happy that I got that video that made me happy by the way I got a little hack on that when when we sold the milk Road my mom was on a vacation with her all of her siblings she has like eight eight or nine siblings and so I got them all like a like I was like hey uh have the hotel call and be like you're uh you know your massage is ready and call all of the rooms at once and then they all went down and basically had got them all kind of like a day pass at the spa in Vegas and it wasn't even that expensive probably a couple thousand dollars but for my mom it was like having a mortgage paid off in that she felt like oh my son treated me to something but also she felt yeah I got to brag my kid is so good she felt good that it was good for everybody it wasn't just good for her and that you know doing something nice for her siblings made her feel so amazing yeah and she could brag that her kid has his [ __ ] together and uh maybe the other ones don't uh someone asked us this question and I'm it it's related to a topic that we're talking to what's the number one thing that you've read or seen recently that's wowed you I read this book called replay it's a novel do you ever read novels yeah I'm like big into novels now I thought like I thought like growing up I was like such a flex question do you read novels like I didn't read any of novels like I was scarred by like grade school or middle school of like having to read novels I don't like and then I got into the business world I'm like oh we only read like Peter teal books we don't read we don't read this nonsense and then now I've fallen in love with them so I love novels I read this great book called Replay by Ken grimwood it's about uh this man who basically dies at the age of 35 and he consistently relives his life over and over and over again and it's like all like he does everything that you would do if you could replay your life which is like what would you do you would like Get Rich by buying stocks you'd probably like get try to get a ton of girls whatever but he is able to talk to his parents again when they were alive and I read that book recently right when I got to that part where he talks to his parents who had died now he's reliving his life again he's able to see his parents it made me very emotional and I called my parents I go hey November like 4th what are you doing cool clear your schedule and so we're taking a big like lavish trip together and so that's awesome this book made a really big impact on me because it gave me this idea of like in 30 or 40 years however long it's going to be when my parents are no longer alive or whatever the situation is of like you cannot do in 20 years what you can do today well I have regretted you know not taking advantage of that period And so I'm I'm trying to I had made a list I'm like here's all the things that 20 years I'm going to regret I'm and I'm gonna go and just get it done now and so that book had a big impact on me oh that's great um I'll give you a couple uh Chris Williamson put a little screenshot essay up that I really liked and he called it I forgot he exactly what he called it but he goes type A people have type B problems and type B people have type A problems so what is he describing so type A is like the achiever the obsessor the kind of like high functioning ADHD or high functioning high anxiety person which is a lot of people who we know aot probably a lot of people who listen to this podcast it serves you really well you get great grades or you'll you'll be successful in your career because you're so like type A about it but you suck at just relaxing chilling enjoying slowing down being grateful you know the mo being in the moment and not thinking constantly about planning for the future or assessing the past and just being there and he goes then there you have the type B person who we all characterize as like the guy who's just they're just walking around wandering through life sniffing flowers like dude you're you're not getting ahead where's your savings account what's your plan how are you going to get ahead you don't have all your ducks in a row what you're missing out and you know Society basically we reward the type A's who even if you're high type A and you you suck at type B it's like okay you it feels like you could always catch up even though in reality you can't and the type B person we sort of look down they almost seem lazy in a way it's like why aren't you getting your act together you know what do you okay you're you're you're prioritizing your happiness too much almost you should be you should be productive right now and I thought it was so true that people fall into these buckets as a as a cliche as a as a oversimplification and it really highlighted to me how undervalued type B people are and I have a few type B people in my life where if you look at their resume or you look at their series of accomplishments or how they spend their day and it just feels like wow you're behind and then when you hang out with them you're like wow you're ahead you you're the one who's got this this thing figured out and I think that one of the big mispriced assets is do you know how to chill dude that's such a you just call the did you just call it uh calmness a price asset sure did sure did you need you need to listen to your own advice brother good call uh you know I call them cold plune people and hot tub people right cold plung is like you're trying to optimize everything you're trying to like shock your nervous system and like get your adrenaline pumping in the morning and hot tub people are trying to hang out have a beer and you know kick it with friends and they're they're happier than the than the cold plunge people and I think one of the things to to really do is to uh take pride in being able to do both well like instead of trying to be a a higher high achiever you know working on being able to shift gears and be able to have both gears and be able to do both well where when did you see this post because like a lot of times people ask us these questions and the most recent thing it's always the most recent thing this was last night oh wait really yeah yeah that's the question you said one thing you've read recently that wowed you recently last night which is uh because I I I try like you do something interesting so whenever you go like to some conference or anything you're you're always like I took these notes on like lessons lessons I learned yeah and I suck at that and so I was curious if this is something that you like um saved from a year ago and you're still contemplating dude I have a slack Channel called Golden nuggets that is like it's a conversation with Me Myself and Irene dude it is the longest conversation it is all just little tiny nuggets that I pick up from from people when Gary tan was on the podcast for example I go here and I write he had this great line he goes go at some point you realize it's all made up but you get to make it up I was like man that's just such a powerful simple way of explaining a lot of life it's all made up these are all Stories We Tell ourselves the rules are made up but like you get to make it up you get to make up your story you tell yourself about yourself about the world about how how your life's going to go I think Gary tan was a top 10 maybe top five person we've ever talked to yeah well that's a good question because one of these in here let me find it here we go Jason from Detroit wants to know a similar thing he says fellas I was looking at the numbers recently you've hit 600 plus episodes 100 plus guests I have to ask you who is on the Mount Rushmore for MFM the number one thing you learned from them and PS I don't want to hear I love them all I can't pick favorites I need you to Dion Sanders it PS PPS did you know that Dion Sanders publicly ranks his kids check it out and he linked us to a article where Dion Sanders is ranking his kids Shiloh moved up dude Dion Sanders Jr is number one yeah he should be that's that's insane DeAndre Sanders number five what shador Sanders who's the quarterback of his uh of his team number four on the number four out of five not doing so hot what a weirdo okay well um I Garett Tan's up there but that's like a recent one so I try actually to stay away I I'll go let me tell you mine really quick dude they're all brown dudes I just realized dares monish and um Sayad uh I guess sayed's not uh uh Indian but two out of the three are Indian which is uh pretty funny daresh is amazing to me darash proves that you can be aggressive while still being calm and nice darash is like shockingly aggressive towards life you know that about dmes he's the co-founder of HubSpot cut to the ad all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of a hundred pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think all right we're back daresh is a a billionaire maybe a multi-billionaire I don't know he started HubSpot which is like a$ 30 billion company and he's been on two to three times I think he's coming on next week or in a few weeks he's super aggressive about life but he comes off like a really nice guy and calm and easy going and like he is calm and easygoing but he's very aggressive about life and I love that what do you mean aggressive about life that's a that's a that's a word that's a phrase tell me what that means so if you ask him about his background he grew up poor in India and he was like I wanted to be the best because I wanted to prove that I was capable of achieving and I also didn't want to have nothing which is what I originally had so he's like I wanted to be great at pingpong and so I studied pingpong and I was the best at the school I went to or he was like someone told me that when I moved to America that apparently what these people do is they go play golf in order to meet clients and take care of clients and he's like I'm a 23y old guy who moved here from India I don't know even know what golf is but then I someone else said well if you can't do that just buy everyone's dinner as much as possible and so he has paid for 100% of the dinners that he's ever gone out to for everyone did I tell you that story no dude din he paid sure enough I went out to dinner with him and it was me Ray Neville and uh dares uh dares walks to the bathroom at the end Nick ray goes watch this he runs and he pays for it daresh sits down and Nick goes my treat daresh stands up he goes this is unacceptable I'm sorry I can't hold on I'll tell you in a minute and he runs to the back of the kitchen he makes him refund Nick Gray's credit card and he gives his credit card and he comes back here let me tell you a story you know when I came here uh from India I didn't want to play golf someone told me to buy dinners so I committed at that age of 22 to 100 % of the time pay for everyone's dinner and I have done this maybe he's 55 now he has he goes I've done it for 25 plus years and so by you paying for dinner I will not allow you to break that uh break that thing and I go have you really done it he goes dude I've done it so much that one time uh we went out to I went out to eat which just like me and Brian of of HubSpot and like apparently there was a company there at a company outing who saw us and bought our dinner as like a thank you because we use HubSpot whatever and so d m was like I didn't have a lot that much money we we we're kind of new but we he goes dude he goes we paid their $115,000 dinner bill because I refused to have that streak broken and so Dar bash is very aggressive about life he started he wanted to teach his kid how to program so they made a online video game that you know makes a million dollars a year or something crazy like it's like hugely popular he's very aggressive about life but if you go hang out with him he's gentle he's soft he'll let you do all the talking and so uh I would say Dar mesh is one of my biggest Inspirations what about yours classic G giant um hard to pick my it's funny though my Mount Rushmore of guest has really nothing to do with their episode and it's just what impression they left on me or what I took away from them that it may not have even been a remarkable episode maybe they didn't tell the best stories or have the the best uh ideas right up the right off the bat so here's a couple of mine mine mine all fall into the bucket of people who are playing their own game so I really really admire probably more than anything else somebody who takes the time to Define how they want to play the game of Life what their rules are what their goals are what their code is that they live by and then of course succeed in doing it and and the result is that they are both happy and successful because you know one without the other is sort of the ultimate failure Ryan holiday comes to mind I don't even I couldn't tell you one thing he said when he was on the podcast Ryan cool [ __ ] since that I followed Ryan I was like man I really appreciate this dude he seems he was I think the only thing I remember on the podcast I told him I go you are one of the uh call like mentally well or something I was like you seem like one of the most well balanced like U grounded people that's ever come on this podcast you just seem like genuinely happy and content and it just comes through in his Vibe you know for example instead of getting money and being like now how do I like like the question we had earlier how do I parlay this into a private Equity thing and make more money off of it he did the thing that he really wanted he bought his own bookstore and made an awesome bookstore and he's like a bookstore is a terrible investment but like he bought a bookstore at the top he built his office at the bottom he's got a bookstore why because he absolutely loves books he loves the vibe of a bookstore so every day he gets to bask in the glory the vibe of his investment whereas I put something in the stock market it's just a number on the screen somewhere and there's these clips of every time he has somebody come on the podcast they record upstairs and on the way out he gives he just starts handing them books he's like have you read this they're like no he's like oh my God you got to read this here let me ear Mark the page where you're going to love this book okay this is their famous book but actually this book is better and he just leaves them they walk out like it's a library and they got like you know six books and I just love Ryan holidays approach he did that with me and I I think it was literally a thousand dollar of books right like it was like a a Year's worth of reading but he's the man I don't know him too well but he's got his Ranch he's got his family he's got he spends his days doing what he loves which is reading and writing and you know exploring ideas he's U tremendous you know everybody I know who's met him respects him and it just seems like is living life on his own terms he's not playing somebody else's game do you know how many books he's uh written by the way how many books he's published I would guess like seven or eight 15 yeah he's prolific and he writes a daily email I don't know how he's like this prolific he's the man and my buddy Billy works for him and you can get a good sense of how somebody is when you talk to somebody who works under them and has for years and he's got you know nothing but good things to say so anyways run holidays up there Jesse hler was kind of like that I really admire this dude's variety so doing uh you know from rapper to starting a jingle company and selling that to starting a private jet share company and selling that to Warren Buffett to creating a coconut water brand to creating now a pickles brand creating a running brand um but he just takes the things he loves it's he is his business is him pushed out he loves running he creates the running club he creates the Everest thing where you run up and down this mountain until you've ran as many miles as Everest he just seems to have taken his passion instead of wearing his heart on his sleeve he just like manifested it through the world of business I think that's really cool creative dude seems like a lot of fun and I like some of his other things like having a misogi for the year or how he his little three C's thing that I stole where he's like yeah every day I take 10 minutes and it's a a compliment a congratulations or a cons uh what's it called when like console consolation for somebody when they when they've gone through something yeah he just thinks of who in my life deserves one of those right now who deserves some congratulations a compliment or or being consoled and uh he text that out it's a very easy way to build amazing relationships in life I'm doing his um 20 it's called 29029 it's the uh Everest it's Everest I think yeah I I I I was invited to his partner I became friends with and he was like pick which one you want to go and so I got Sarah signed up for it and we're we have to pick the date but yeah it sounds awesome dude it's really popular by the way there it's also really expensive and they're all always sold out as it should be uh the last one I had is mik poser on my little Mount Rushmore which I I don't think that episode's come out yet but he said a couple of things that stood out to me but the biggest one is just a operating Philosophy for for any Creator um you know he he his first song was a hit whatever five time 5x Platinum his second song was a little disappointing only three times Platinum his third song Only One X Platinum felt like total failures and every time he went to the studio trying to make a hit he goes I only succeeded in making something that I hated and nobody else loved uh when I when I went in trying to make a hit that everybody would love all I made was something that everybody else hated uh or something that I hated and also because I hated it everybody else hated it too and he goes now my philosophy is very simple I just do what's cool to me and every once in a while the whole world decrees and I just thought that is a wonderful Banner cry for a Creator an artist is to say I just make what's cool to me and sometimes the whole world agrees yeah he um that documentary he has where he walks across the country that or it's like a music video actually is it a music video it's like a 10-minute video so good he's very inspiring yeah watch music video for move on is that is that the it feels like a documentary uh because like there's so much talking in it but or you know a 10-minute one that's pretty badass all right which one should we do let's go to this one Isaac from Maryland says I just started training boxing thanks for the inspiration and I took my first liver shot wow son of a gun uh it feels like somebody hit the off button on my body and I thought about it later and I started thinking what's the equivalent of a liver shot in business we all know that a punch to the jaw is the thing that's supposed to knock you out but sometimes it's the sneaky liver shot that gets you I told my wife about this idea and she says that sounds like something stupid that your friends on that stupid podcast would talk about so let's have it boys what's the liver shot of business tell me if you felt this before you're having a problem in your company and you think I have found this one person that's going to change everything everything's going to be better because I've hired this one person I think in Have I Ever Had A situ okay so maybe that could happen I don't think I've ever had a situation where my expectations have been lived up to and wait what did you just say you've never had a situation where your expectations been living up to when my no when my expectation is that this person is going to be the Silver Bullet oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah they're never lived up to and it's not their fault they could be fantastic but like whenever I like I'll buy into someone so much and they'll do like one thing that like kind of is a bummer to me and then I'm like what else is there that you're going to do and like homeopathic medicine [ __ ] yeah not you get yeah it's like I have to try uh it's so yeah Ive felt that so many times and I've always made I make that mistake consistently where I buy into someone you know like when you're you're like in high school and you're like seen a girl or like a girl you got to crush on so much and like she finally gives you like the chance and you're like every life is perfect I have crossed the threshold and like elbows yeah or like her like her ring toe is like bigger than like her big toe you know what I mean like uh D I hate that for real I know it's out of their control and I think like 30% of the population has that thing where one toes longer than the other but it's disgusting to me have you seen shallow how where like he uh it's like this ugly dude dates like the 10 out of 10 model but her toe is like that so he breaks up with her only on this podcast will you get a Warren Buffett quote and a shallow how quote the the five minutes do you know who makes an appearance in shoh how is uh Tony Robbins Tony Robbins he's like the whole point in the movie like he convinces Jack Black to only see people's inner beauty so now he only sees people it's pretty funny I love that movie I think it's a great um getting my gut punch is like being let down by people which is frankly I'm 100% to blame for that right right uh mine is actually just having a health issue either you or someone you know really close to you when you're running a startup because the day before everything felt level 10 important and this was the most important thing in the world we're on a mission we're at War this is this is everything and then as soon as you have a health a real health issue um there's that phrase you know a man has a thousand problems until he has a health problem then he only has one problem and it's so true like the liver punch in business is when you have a real life scare and you're like wow I feel so stupid for having just spent like caring so much about these stupid kpis and metrics and dialing the knobs and optimizing this funnel it's like dude honestly who gives a [ __ ] um so it is the the the one thing that really just shook me out of the delusion of like business felt like everything to me until that happened that was my my liver punch I always feel that way whenever I have a nurse treat me like you know like nurses nurses a real job dude they're like the tugboats of world war you know like tugboats like are like have like helped us win World War II like the tugboats work their asses off to get these ships out there but they're the unsung heroes you know no one like gave tugboats love Tugboat what do tugboats do I don't know this so uh during World War II we were like building ships like crazy or I'll give you a better analogy uh 911 during 911 uh you know what a tugboat is like a tug really is it a tiny boat that pulls Bo so when you let's say you have a cruise ship when a cruise ship comes into a relatively small place like for example when a cruise ship is going to dock in San Francisco you need a tugboat to go out and get it and like drag it and place it perfectly where it goes but they've been the unsung heroes for many occasions so for example during World War II we were building ships like crazy and getting them out there these [ __ ] tugboats were working their asses off and they like and like the tugboat operators were like performing miracles with on 911 on 911 it was like the tugboats that were getting people off the island of Manhattan uh to like Brooklyn or whatever and uh nurses are like tugboats like you forget about a nurse like or you think you kind of dismiss a nurse as like you go to the hospital for the doctor it's the Doctor Who's the most important and then you like a nurse will come and like give you Advil or like give you a popsicle and like soothe you and you're like you're you're so much more important a you're more important than the doctor maybe and B you're more important than my [ __ ] job like it's it's not even close 100% all right let's do another one you pick one off here if you could Shadow anyone for a week to learn how they operate who would it be and why all right I would split it between either somebody who's hyper productive which might as well go for Elon because there's all these myths about Elon and I I just want to see it for myself I want to see what's the real deal how's this guy running four companies and playing Diablo at night and got 11 kids and like I want to actually follow this guy and see what's going on what's Diablo what is Diablo it's a game video game okay that he's like streaming on on X at night like the same night you know they catch the the Starship right they catch the heaviest rocket ever with like these Chopsticks then the same night he's playing Diablo for like four hours on stream and he's like doing like a highlevel raid um it's pretty wild in the same way that do you know this LeBron James recently screenshotted this thing out that he was a top top 100 ranked Madden player or like he reached rank 100 which is like the top rank no way and that's going to be one of the most played games in the world right yeah it doesn't mean he's a top 100 player but it means he he still reached the top rank of the people who are playing competitively at that moment that's still impressive it doesn't matter still impressive or like you know we've tell the story about Travis colanic being the number two or three Wii tennis player in the world Luca donic who's like one of the best basketball players in the world he's a he's a top 100 OverWatch player I've played a lot of OverWatch this is insane it's insane that what's OverWatch is that a war game it's a first person shooter um or I don't know what You' call it's like a team first person shooter or whatever and he's the best or one of he's he's a he's a Grandmaster player top and he reached top I think he was top 500 which is the the the they don't do top 100 they do top 500 and Luca was in the top 500 it's insane like I I I can't believe it and people are like oh well these guys they're athletes they have a lot of time to play video games a lot of down time when their body still ridiculous I don't give a [ __ ] dude I was playing OverWatch you know three hours a day for like you know two years I couldn't even break you know bronze this is incredible uh how he did that um I think I want to all right so did you read that New York Times article on Alex karp I didn't read it actually but a bunch of people recommended it what did it say so he's the CEO of paler what did it say Alex karp is the CEO of paler paler is like almost a hundred billion dollar company and they're kind of controversial because they typically have a Libertarian to Republican lean culture in Silicon Valley that's like not common and he's also like a freak and so he's a freak because he grew up like in Germany I believe uh and he says uh and he says ridiculous stuff so he's like uh I've got some I think he said I got a Jewish mom and a black dad uh I can get away with anything like he says like silly things like that or he'll be like uh the only time I'm not he said this on like a um like a quarterly earnings call he's like the only time I'm not thinking about paler is when I'm out cross country skiing or having sex like he just like kind of like says like ridiculous stuff like that but he's just like a weirdo and and and and I I really like this he uh was raised in Germany he went to school as a philosophy major Peter teal and him used to argue all the time and debate Peter Teal's uh right of Center Alex karp's left of center and so they had opposite politics and he said in the article that they would argue like ravenous animals and because of that they fell in love with each other and Peter teal and Joe Lonsdale came to karp with this idea for paler and he was the perfect person to uh lead and run the company and so he just tells like 25 years of stories in the New York Times article because this is his moment the company 25 years old but they are finally like the top dog and he tells all these crazy stories and he's just quirky and weird and I love that the the article starts Alex karp never learned to drive his quote I was too poor and then I was too rich the picture is him wearing pink socks at his new New Hampshire home just like sort of sitting in his everything about him is weird everything you just said about that is like different and strange keep going I'm Jewish racially ambiguous dyslexic so I can say anything yes um okay wow he's just quirky man he's really funky so you want to follow this guy because you think he's a genius or you just think this guy's a weird a weirdo and you just want to see it up close all the above Annie is living in his own world I have friends that who uh report to him at paler and they love him like this is one of those stories where you said similarly to ran holiday where he talk to people who work for him they all love them they have jokes and they I think they reference it in the article they call him Papa carp or daddy karp like they like rever him like this wise like Sage guy yeah okay this guy's pretty fascinating um okay so Alex karp would be your pick easy nice the other I I would either do someone super productive like Elon or somebody Super Creative like the the creators of South Park that documentary uh six days to air is one of myv miserable life things to watch how hard is that like be either of them both of them play the game on absolute hard mode but if you're you know if I want to break my frame I'm not going to hang out with people who have exactly kind of like what I feel comfortable with it's I want to hang out with people who play the game at level 12 so I know what the hell level 12 is and then I'll dial it back to eight or nine which is where I like to I like to stay in that range but I don't you you don't even know what an eight or nine is unless you've seen what the extreme is I want to see the extreme of productivity in the extreme of creativity yeah man that documentary is amazing basically for those who haven't seen it I think it's on YouTube for free South Park which has been around for 25 years it's basically two guys Matt and Trey they come up with an an entire 30 minute episode in six days so from idea to it being live is six days and they do that every single season and they've done for 25 years which is which is unheard of that that timeline is unheard of most animated shows would be like you know sort of like a it's like a family nine months six to nine months 12 months that's like normal six days just breaks your brain of how do you do that and the way they do that is they're like they're you know it's like Monday we're pitching ideas and then we grab the idea the animator start start drawing we go into the studio we start doing the voices so that the animators have the dialogue we're working out the jokes as we go it's crazy they also do that uh with SNL by the way I saw this interview with him recently so uh you won't I don't know if you will know this but I lived in Denver and that's where they're from and there's this restaurant that's famous there called casab Bonita do you know about this Bonita story they bought it and it's amazing do you know what it is first was it like I know it's in this TV show I watch the show all the time it was a joke in the show where it was like Cartman wanted to go there and there's like it's like is it Mexican I guess and there's people jumping off like Cliffs into pools and there's like all you can eat Mexican food imagine you walk in to the biggest Rainforest Cafe you've ever seen so you walk in and it feels like you're in a cave or some kind of like treasure hunt sort of situation but you're says part Rainforest Cafe on steroids part lunch cuz you just grab a tray and you walk down this it's like a it's like Ikea you walk down this path and then there's like these lunch ladies just putting slop on your tray and the slop is the worst Mexican food you've ever had in your life and then you get out to you finally exit the maze where you got your slop on your tray you sit down and now you're at like this table and there's this it's this huge restaurant that has these like a giant indoor waterfall and then there's a whole show that happens with cliff divers and they're diving into the water and there's like a it's like a little play that's happening so then you get Broadway so you get Broadway the Rainforest Cafe and like the craziest prison lunch you've ever had it's like an experience it was dying and I guess you know there it's like a staple for anybody who lives in that area it's like it's like a thing and you knew if it ever died it would never come back because the whole idea doesn't even make sense in the first place so they bought it for like I think a couple million bucks and the guy said they go he goes so you've since had to invest in like kind of turning it around I saw this and he's like yeah we invest a lot of money he goes how much do you invest he goes we put in about $40 million to rescue this restaurant which is just insane and they along the way they filmed it as they were trying to rescue this thing that turned into its own documentary and so just a crazy crazy story is the food better the the reviews on it are like still not good I I don't know I don't want to hear any bad things about it I I love those guys I love CA Bonita I have a lot of memories from there as a kid and I love that these guys tried to basically the same thing that the fertitas did with the UFC where they bought it for two million bucks and then lost 40 million trying to like build the brand they did that but just with CA Bonita instead dude but yeah I don't know if the outcome is going to be the same but that's pretty wild I mean they're like epically Rich those guys they they've been Rich guys in restaurants name a better combo like [ __ ] um all right want to do one more or is that it let's do this fatherhood one so Jeremy from Austin okay that's uh maybe somebody you know he says I'm assumed to be Dad I've read all the books I listened to the podcast but I got to hear from the boys what advice was actually useful underlined for when you became a dad so we all get advice what was actually useful dude mine's so much easier um yours is going to be like insightful and philosophical here's mine mine was like so easy so you it's it was called like the five s's but it really could just be like two so when a baby's crying 0 to 3 months you swaddle them super tight I was shocked at how tight you need to be you turn them tighter than you think you're supposed to be doing yeah like you're putting this thing in a straight jacket like like Child Protective Services need to be called like that's how like tight it feels like when you swallow these kids and then you hold them on their side when they're crying and you lift them up in your ear and you shush at them but when you shush it's super loud like I when they taught me how to do it I'm like that's gonna hurt the baby's ear and they're like no this I don't know however it works this is what they're used to hearing you shush really loud in their ear and they quit crying after like 20 seconds so it was like the swaddle sideways shush that was very productive all right that's good um I'll tell you what doesn't help first so when I when we got pregnant for the first time it was like oh better get some sleep now that's not how sleep works and that doesn't do anything don't don't tell me that well you can't build it up with a bank if they wanted to say what could you actually do before the kid comes which is not much it'd be like uh hey just take this 15b dumbbell and curl it just hold it in the curl and then try to do the rest of your life so now operate you know do your computer and like make food and do everything while curling this thing because that's actually the only prep that would that would have actually helped I I I think the biggest prep is mental uh for at least for the dad here's what I think are the the three phases of fatherhood this is my bit I'm working on I'm working on a bit here all right the three phases of fatherhood are I want kids that's phrase one I want kids yeah I want kids hell yeah and then phase two which is when you're pregnant and the baby's coming I want kids dot dot dot right right scary now and that's phase two and then phase three which comes AO you think it's supposed to come when the baby's born but it will not for most people it comes like 12 to 18 months later is I can't live without kids and then that's what that's where you will get to that's the third phase it does come have faith and so uh totally normal to have the initial I want this then the questioning and the doubt and the the Panic the freak out then the initial anti-climatic thing where the baby's an inanimate object and you're kind of useless as a dad you're kind of just helping the mom uh and you don't feel too much that was at least my was my experience and um that's you're kind of concerned you're like wait do I not have a soul why why don't I feel what I'm supposed to feel about this kid and then at sort of 12 to 18 months once they start to like smile and laugh or you know crawl like do things like that then you're able to then then it turns around and you're you're like I can't imagine life without without kids I probably spoke to 30 guys before I had my kid and I was like what should I expect uh and I asked all of them a very like blunt question but they all understood what I meant which was did you love her right away or did you love the baby right away and of the probably 70% of them said no I had love but I wasn't didn't love cared about I cared but like there I was a in love until let's say eight or 10 months something like that um I personally was into it because I had animals like it kind of replaced like a dog for me if I'm being honest like where like I love dogs and I was I like that I like that type of [ __ ] so I was into it but I Was preparing not to be into it right away Lowered Expectations the key to life I think most men aren't into their kids for you know what I mean when I say into uh in love for like eight eight months dude I had a hilarious dinner with this guy and he was like yeah I am you know if I'm honest it's hard I I I same same description I I care but I guess I wouldn't say I'm like totally like Head Over Heels like you know can't live without them type of thing it's like roommate it's like a roommate that you enjoy I was like oh totally totally normal turns around you know 12 18 months they're like yeah they're three I oh you're broken dude you know what also shocked me like every all of my friends after they have kids they all most of them have said similar things which is I wish I started sooner and that shocked me I it was always the opposite I thought I I always thought it was the opposite I don't waste that I'm like I I I'm glad I got in all the the stuff that you can only do when you're you know Young Wild and Free I'm glad I got that in because it's a one-way door once you do it you can't there is no there's no breaks there's no Mulligans you at least for me so you know it just seems like it's uh I'm glad I took the time all right that's this episode we're going to call this mailbag mailbags are fun um if you have questions again like this go to mfmp pod.com and we're goingon to add a contact button and you could ask questions there yeah we'll add a mailbag button drop them in there make them entertaining make them fun we like them all right that's it that's the pod [Music] n

I don't think people are prepared or even aware of what's about to happen right now and it's like super super good news for anyone who's running a [Music] business Sam have you seen I feel like there's a new meme that got birthed and I think Gary's involved with it now which is the learn to cook loser have you seen this Sam what is that what is that can this posted it I don't even know what it was a reply to but it seems to be going viral so it's a good meme I think somebody Paul gr was talking about cooking he was like giving his kid advice and he's like you know when you have a girlfriend or something like that like you know they love to come home to the smell of like a meal being cooked and then someone immediately you know random Twitter troll is like why you raising like a feminine man like you know he should be masculine he doesn't need to learn to cook and then I think Paul's reply was learn to cook comma loser and then all the builders like I'm and others basically like tech people were like you know this is actually good general advice like learn to cook as a high agency way of living I think it's like the compressed idea of you know build things actually make things actually go do things in the world that totally you know are of value maybe I'm reading too much into it it's a more succinct version of make something people want it's the punched up version Lear to cook loser is is Paul Graham like the definition of success basically built like one of the greatest companies of all time YC and then it started working well and then just baales to Europe where he's living in a I don't actually know if this is true but it appears he's living in the woods writing and being with his family and I'm like is this guy did he just did he just P pull the ultimate move and it worked out perfectly I think so I think he really did what's what's your version of that I mean more or less like weissy as a concept is like kind of a miracle it's you there are very very few um places in the world where anything like YC ever happens and then I just feel like I need to be like The Watcher on the wall it's like okay let's uh this thing is working and then it's working for relatively mysterious reasons that are almost too obvious I mean it's but at once a mystery and it's obvious y see itself is like pretty Earnest like it's just make something people want applying this thing will try to go through and sincerely find the things we think could be really really big and then we just give you a bunch of money and throw you in a room with all the other people who are you know sort of the top 1% of people trying to do that thing and then somehow some magic happens where you know five to 10 per of those companies become worth a billion dollars or more and um you know YC takes some Equity but not that much you know like 7% specifically for people who often wouldn't have access to that capital or that Network like by default anywhere anywhere else I mean so it's kind of cool it's just uh you know 1 plus 1 equals 3 in a really unusual way um sort of resembles a college in some ways you know only instead of people paying tuition like we pay them you know when I think of good brands a lot of people will just think of like like funny or cool things but when you think of like what black rock or Goldman like some of these names they're kind of like or Harvard they're like they're little ominous and like a little scary but they're institutions do you ever purposely think how do we become an institution or is this just all because of you just said let's have high standards like was it on purpose or did it just happen because you had good values how does that happen I mean I think a lot of it comes back to you earlier we were talking about Paul Graham and um the guy's just a very unusual original thinker and very just clear communicator and then I think the thing I learned from him in particular is that clear communication and you know just using basic logic being able to explain you sort of you know A to B to see and then you zoom out and there's a really big idea in there that's you know in essence what a really good pitch is um you know I think that that's where it came from like Paul was just very you know both frankly Paul and Jessica Livingston his wife and co-founder the two of them basically created this thing that feels different didn't feel like another investor felt very welcoming I mean the sort of uh viral tweet I think PG has about Jessica is like you know Jessica once cut a Founder's fingernails before he went on stage at demo day or something just because it's it's like sort of you know at once very exacting you know we have very high standards but then it's at at once also very um sort of like almost family or like homey just um welcoming and you know sort of that mix of both very Earnest and very formidable like those two things combined created I don't know something that seems to create Magic isn't it Wild by the way like just think about this so one of my companies I recently taken through like an m&a process and I talked to bankers and bankers so we we you go first and interview Bankers like why should I go with you why should I give you 4% of this transaction for six months of work here at the very end and all about their differentiated process how they do more more more how they have the smartest people in the room and all the things they brag about about what makes them successful on paper makes sense but it's kind of the midwit meme because if you look at YC it's like yeah we um we invest in people before they even have an idea a lot of the time they have no no traction often they have to change ideas we don't negotiate every deal we just 7% for every single company uh same deal that's it the application yeah it's like a one page form you f out online the oh the interview yeah we talked to you for 10 minutes and we just give you a thumbs up thumbs down from there like all of the things y only minutes yeah it's 10 minutes oh my God 10 minute interview and they're picking winners at a higher rate than anybody else I think the you know they're attracting winners at a higher rate than anybody so it makes it easier to pick but they're picking winners at a higher rate than every other investor even though their process is simpler and less than what you would think you need in order to be you know the the number one player in the space and they basically I think I've read the stat it's pretty insane you guys basically every time you run a batch you basically print $3 billion of market cap on average uh I did some math and I looked at the the batch values so you know like something like 5% of all the companies become unicorns but every and you just do that a couple times a year you're doing it twice a year now you're doing it four times a year you're like oh yeah let's just print three3 billion dollars of market cap two four two to four times a year that is mindblowing like that is so insane yeah I mean I I think the the craziest thing I'd ever heard was basically the Airbnb round where I think something like under $20,000 became $2 billion in the liquid IPO when airpnp ipoed so and you know YY didn't even take the pratus then so it's pretty wild honestly like you know easily could have returned five to seven billion dollars with a good portfolio management strategy but you know that's the thing I think uh simple things work actually it's a if YC was a a company cuz I think it's been around like 18 years you said in the last 18 years you know YC's got to be up there in like the top 10 Silicon Valley companies things that got created that created so much value um do you think about it that way or is there do you have a good that's what I try and get people to understand like this isn't just you know working at a company this is uh you know I think we did the math on um how much money per employee YC in theory should drive and uh I think we're something like 20ish million dollars per year per employee in terms of like you know sort of market cap value created in the world and that's just the carry like that's our take like you know in terms of value created for our limited partners and you know sort of overall in in sort of I think it's like close to 100 million per year per employee so it's pretty wild who who are the LPS even is it like these pension fund types just like a VC fund or who invest in VC I mean the wild thing about YC is I think we're going to release a white paper on this pretty soon but I haven't talked about this publicly before um we looked at a two-year period from 2018 to 2020 of people who invested in at least three YC companies per batch for those two years the uh top top desile predictably was very good it was like 16x uh the top quartile was also very good it was 8X uh I mean these are outrageous returns for such a short period of time in Venture period the wild thing though is median was 5x and then the bottom quartile was 3.3x so it's really crazy because in Venture per if you look at how VCS make money it's all in the power law there's only you know sort of the top 25% make any money at all and then the top quartile generally for any given year of DC uh is only 3x so it's pretty wild what's happening you've read I think I read something you've read 6,000 YC applications so you've seen more of this than anybody else you're the admissions officer you've been in a lot of these uh interviews you've then seen the companies grow what do the extreme winners look like early on and do they look any different than the average company I mean honestly they're very similar like my two craziest wins one was Brian Armstrong at coinbase and he was uh a solo software engineer working uh at you know anti fraud at Airbnb and uh you know he had never started a company before he you a lot of the things we worked on with him very early were like sort of the basics that you know it's sort of hard to believe now uh on the other side of him having built coinbase it's kind of hard to believe that you know there was a time when Brian Armstrong didn't know how to you know do a product launch or um you know even raise a single dime from investors so I think it's basically been that same profile like highly technical people who are just like sort of smart and Earnest and that's about it like that's sort of mainly who we like to fund um and then it's I think unusually really really important today in 2024 I mean large language models have basically opened everything up Ian I mean almost anything that a knowledge worker can do you know anyone with 130 IQ or below pretty sure that with workflow and evals you could write software now that could do what that you know basically almost any knowledge worker could do and you could do it perfectly with like no management headaches it's I think like really profound moment for all entrepreneurs period hey let's take a quick break to talk about AI we all know big deal um you see demos all the time of people doing really cool things but as a business owner sometimes it's hard to figure out how do I actually use this what do I actually do I've been trying to use it across all my businesses you know things like making little prototype websites without needing to hire a coder or writing copy for our website or I give it a bunch of data and I ask it to analyze it for me it's been kind of amazing but the thing I always need is inspiration I know the tool can do a lot but it can almost do so much that I'm not really sure what I should actually be doing with it and so that's why I think it's great that HubSpot has has created a report where they surveyed 2,000 Global Marketing leaders and asked them yeah what's separating the high growth and low growth businesses and what strategies they're using with AI in their business you can grab these strategies and apply them to your own business for free the link is in the description below yeah I think me and Sam have both had uh learned a code on our to-do list for like 12 years about the about the uh you know Python the Hard Way course on you to me did all that [ __ ] I think we we now we get to skip the learn to it's just C now you don't have to do the learn to part you don't need to actually write it I mean it helps to be able to write a little bit yourself but yeah I mean the Wild Thing from here is with like the new developments in 01 and cod genen I actually think it'll be more important that you're able to speak to Virtual developers and like instruct them on exactly what you want and all the different use cases and like we're right at that moment where it's going from like you really have to code it all yourself to you can just sort of talk to this pretty smart entity that will you know do it mostly for you like it's not even about no code anymore I was doing that the other day where I was talking to chat gbt where I was like explaining like here's the problems my business is having can you help me like can you just like be a therapist with me and help me like come up with interesting Solutions and the answers were shockingly good by the way it was like it was like pretty good at just like brainstorming with me and just being like a sparring partner is there a you know like I know that see a lot of it comes down to making people what people want and things like this and to me that's a that's like um a bit of an art where you you're you're more of an artist and a scientist but is there a world where you could take their 6,000 applications and a bunch of other data that you have and kind of spreadsheet your way to like the likelihood that we build a company that and I think there's magic to create these like multi Deca unicorns or whatever but is there a way where you could like use your data and spreadsheet your way to like well here's the interesting opportunity this is going to get to some type of traction and wealth creation with a high rate of certainty conceivable you know some of it is like we think someone might do something like that and it might totally work actually and then the trickiest thing is like how do you actually get really smart people to come and do that thing and you know I mean Capital as a service has been and I I think like chth talked about that and I thought it was very interesting what did he say sounds conceivable uh I mean I think they experimented with this when he was still working on Social Capital where instead of uh having a 10-minute interview and you know how it works at YC is we actually have 14 equal group Partners including myself so we actually you know handre these applications and you know you're not talking to an AI when you do the 10-minute interview it's literally just talking with us and then once we fund you we're just working with people dayto day you know for those 10 12 weeks and then onwards into the future of the company like we own you know 7% of the company we're like a big seed investor so we need to sort of be around and it's very like High touch and you get like an individual person and then I think like the capital as a service idea like is really just you know connect your metrics connect your stripe account your bank account your QuickBooks you know I mean it's actually pretty doable today like it's conceivable that someone should connect all those things up and then an LM can just you know rank whether something's real or not do the diligence and then if you like hit a certain bar like boom like here's money in your bank account Sam did you ever see that when they did that for for growth stage companies I think they called it the eightball it was like you you connect all your data and then it'll it'll D just tell you they like they could just take your raw data and they could put it into a format where they needed to analyze it but then secondly they benchmarked you so they're like oh wow they have Best in Class retention for this category or they're below average so don't invest right I thought the results were like interesting but not like like too early yeah where like this is interesting but do you remember when um chat gbt started getting popular I think Sean two years years ago and there was a guy on Twitter who had a really funny like name it was like Greenpoint or something like that and he told chat gbt like make me a a Content website that can rank high on search and it can monetize on ads and I think within like three months he got it to like $20,000 in monthly Revenue do you remember that story oh yeah like the normal way now is I prompt Ai and I want AI to be an agent with he did was the opposite he's like you tell me what to do I'll be your human agent you but you have the good ideas you prompt me and thought that was I bet it would work extra well now with uh 01 like the new reasoning model Gary can I ask you a question you um today you probably think about like you know the future and billion- dollar ideas but when you were 14 I read that you kind of had your own hustle there you were cold calling companies in the Yellow Pages trying to get work and you you made enough money to kind of actually help your family out like move from an apartment to a house can you tell that story I've never heard that before yeah of course um I mean let's see I mean my parents we grew up you sometimes food insecure my dad was a foreman in a machine shop and my mom was a home health aid and certified nursing assistant at convalescent homes she worked two jobs and uh me and my brother lived in you know apartments in freem in the Bay Area sort of in the shadow of Silicon Valley and uh I guess one of the weirder things is like my dad's actually an engineer but he just didn't have the EQ to really hold on to jobs and he also struggled with alcoholism so we just he was always losing his job and so we were always just like never had money around and the thing was like he really did invest in computers like we had our first computer was a uh you know IBM PC XT so you know we were sort of reality poor but you know rich in access to computers which was like really really powerful for me and um I just realized oh yeah like I'm 14 but I you know know how to make web pages and I started winning some awards for like web design as a kid in junior high I started an underground newspaper with my um uh Junior High friends and uh we learned how to make a website for that underground newspaper and we got and we called it an online Zen and uh the funniest thing was like we had you know thousands of people would find it off of uset news groups and things and we'd write articles that you know uh I don't think people knew that we were 14 like when uh when you're on the internet one thing we learned is like nobody knows that you're a dog I guess I don't know like people would just write letters to the editor like we were like a legitimate publication and I just got sort of really addicted to that like like like an early vice.com yeah basically like I think we wrote uh you know my my buddy wrote a editorial about you know how the three strikes law was bad for California and you know we were like 12 years old like what do we know about any of that stuff but um you know on the internet nobody can tell and you know I I think we wrote it in pretty clear English like people couldn't tell that we were that young and then I I feel like I got really addicted to the internet and then I thought well maybe I can make money and uh you know back then there was this thing called The Yellow Pages that they throw on your doorstep and that's how you would find businesses and I thought okay the yellow page is probably my link to making money somehow like if they have a business and they have a little ad in the yellow page is literally in the print section like you know and this was not so early that like the the internet had eaten Yellow Pages yet but it was uh late enough that there was an internet section so I just started cold callings you know seeing hey like I know how to make web pages will anyone hire me and sure enough I ended up getting a job and riding my bike to the Local web design firm that made City websites for like city of Pleasanton and Fremont and San Jose and uh you know basically they paid me you know 10 bucks seven bucks and 10 bucks an hour to work on I mean I learned how to do graphic design I learned HTML what is that uh what's that phone script oh God yeah first you have to deepen your voice right you can't can't be 14 on the call that's right and it's like oh I'm I'm a web I'm a awardwinning web designer and you know but I'm 14 but did you say that yeah I think so I mean um it's funny I mean I remember my first boss he was this was sort of his like side hustle so by the way is award-winning designer in your LinkedIn now I don't know if it is yeah that's a Miss it's funny I mean I remember it was like this company called infol Lane it was you know they had a one like basically I think it had a conference room and you know sort of an engineer den and a loot and like a little reception desk and that was the whole office and um I think it was one really technical like sort of neck beard Unix guy and then uh the funny thing was the CEO was also a bank a regional bank manager I think at Fremont Bank and so you know the tech guy had walked into the local Fremont Bank and you know the internet was happening and this bank manager was like I'm gonna give I'm going to invest myself like I'm going to invest my own money and he became like the co-founder on this you know web design firm in uh 1993 94 so it was pretty wild to to think about I mean that's just how you started business and that was what business was like you didn't go on the internet and apply on a form or something you literally walked into a bank and Banks were supposed to loan you money to start companies which you know I think to some extent still happens but you know it's just funny to think like uh how that's evolved since and and at some point did you just make enough where you were like Mom Dad here like I can help or what happened yeah I mean we I always lived in apartments growing up and I had a a little brother who was eight years younger and you know I wanted us to live in I wanted the American dream and so um you know I still remember like uh helping cook the turkey at Thanksgiving and you know the new house that you know our our family bought and uh you know I help my parents with the down payment and my parents still live in that home in Fremont so I'm I'm helping them remodel it right now that's amazing by the way I looked up your old blog I think back in 2001 you you wrote the following which I think is pretty accurate you said you know blogs are all over the place this is back in 2001 so over 20 years ago pretty soon we'll all just be writing a Blog we won't really talk to friends or have to catch up anymore human interaction will just boil down to clicking on someone's name on your favorite website and that'll be it no more tedious how do you do over a nice ma matcha frappuccino at some pretentious Cafe just read my blog if you want to know what's up oh my God predicted social media it wasn't exactly blogging but that's Instagram stories that's Facebook that's that's the news feed exactly uh I think you nailed it for better and For Worse that's funny man I wish um the one thing I wish I could do is like go back in time and tell myself don't sell uh your time like don't work for a consulting firm or like you know get paid $10 an hour like go make products but did you did you ever do that I thought you were pretty young when you first started getting involved with YC oh uh I was 27 so I was much later honestly I mean you look very young in the photos you actually didn't need to come from the future because I think I've heard a story that you were working somewhere Microsoft or something like that oh yeah and Peter teal was Peter teal was like hey quit your job in fact I'll pay you your whole salary to quit your job and come co-found this new company this little company we got called paler yeah it's like a 95 billion dollar market cap company today and you turned them down can you uh I mean what the hell were you thinking can you just embarrass yourself here of course I mean I you know went to Stanford computer engineering uh I mean changed my life obviously a fraternity Brothers of mine Joe L or Joe Joe lone and Stephen Cohen Stephan and I went to high school together grew up together tried to start a bunch of companies together um you know I was a year out of school you was 2004 and I thought like oh look at me I have health insurance I have a real job and then my old fraternity brothers who were a couple years uh behind me at Stanford like I guess they couldn't get a real job so they're going to you know go start a company I don't know it's really funny to think about in retrospect but you know one of the things that was always really smart about the Peter heel world is uh when you start something you always just need the smartest people around you and I was lucky enough that I made you know Joe and Stefan's list when that happened and uh you know Peter was just running the Playbook that worked for him when he sold P PayPal which is and this is something that people at paler do all the time now it's like when you start a thing you you know take a 8 and 1 half by 11 sheet of paper and you write down all the smartest people you know and then you go take them out to dinner and lunch and just you know sit on their doorstep until they quit their jobs to come join you and uh you know I guess it was pretty I mean Peter was not a billionaire yet I think like the funniest thing about PayPal and the PayPal Mafia is that like they basically fought a land war in Asia against eBay you know I mean when you don't have when you have to work on other people's distribution and other people's platforms you just end up becoming like the most vicious hardcore you know Builder fighter types to just like gut it out to build a business on someone else's platform and then uh the exit for PayPal was just not big enough that it made people yeah it made people like able to take lots of risk but not so much that they had lost all energy and will to fight well and there was a and there was a bunch of them too so that got divvied up a bunch yeah as well how much was Peter teal worth do you think at that conversation because like let's say you made $880,000 that that's like a big deal right to be out to dinner with like I'll give you 80 grand right now just to quit yeah totally to get a co-founder or co-founding engineer like I I I some of it is like I could see myself doing that today I mean I think pet was probably worth like at least a couple hundred or at least a hundred million at that moment more than enough to to be able to to say something like outlandish like that yeah I mean I think it's a fair trade today like I would definitely trade like my know my gold Rolex for a first co-founding engineer of a company that I think could be worth a hundred billion dollar in the future that is a fair trade did he make a compelling pitch like about the company or was he just like I don't know this is just like a bet like was he did he see the future in that that sense of like what it became yeah absolutely I mean I think the thing I really learned from that moment I mean I was 22 I didn't know how the world worked at all I mean we had dinner at his French restaurant fre Zone uh I think that's one of the things you do when you you know make it to send to millionaires you do something stupid like open a restaurant and uh I mean the restaurant was terrible like the sou was really bad and I mean he lost like millions of dollars on that restaurant right I think so I mean today it's this really nice steakhouse but yeah it was bad um and then you know what I should have done I mean I was so lacking in social graces you know they did the whole pitch and then I think I said no like before the soup came out even and so was just like awkwardly sitting there for the rest of the dinner and he had actually re he was like here like here's a check like $70,000 you know how much a year do you make in Microsoft here's $70,000 cash this check I didn't really understand it in the moment and then I think in retrospect like sort of the the number one thing that I didn't understand that I do now sort of realize like I have to tell you know tell everyone this is how it works is um you know I didn't join at the time because I thought that um the world was sort of told to you or like you know sort of narrated to you I guess you know I thought oh the Wall Street Journal isn't writing about enterprise software this isn't a hot space and so you know that that was like fundamentally the backward way of thinking like the world doesn't like happen to you if you are actually a like prime mover in the world like Peter teal or my friends um you go out and you go into the world and you discover something about the world like you actually talk to people like you actually talk to your users and uh you I sort of gather a primary First Source information on how the world works and what they had done was realized that the world's biggest companies and uh the world's biggest governments had no access to software Engineers or you know Big D back then people said like big data or data mining was like you know today we say AI but either way were just buzzwords for Concepts that are like actually pretty real like I think they you know went into the security apparatus of like the three-letter agencies in DC and realized like all the people they talked to you know they were working even CIA nay like the you know people who we expect to have the world's best technology they really don't and Peter knew that because he somehow the CIA NSA whatever when PayPal was running they're like uh you guys want to have a conversation or like you know how how does like a like a Silicon Valley kind of outcast get a CIA tip yeah I mean my inter I I don't know specifically I mean how they described it to me I think was like they learned a lot about how the world Works through the anti-f fraud part of PayPal and the core idea was that um they could find these fraud Rings just using a graph database just literally you know people make a bunch of fake identities they send the money from one fake identity to another and uh if you're just using SQL or a row based method you just couldn't figure it out but the second you like graft it out you would find this ring and you know uh what they found was that you know the the three-letter agencies didn't have access to that technology so you know what I needed to do was instead of taking my worldview from the media or you know today from social media or from you know what reporters were sort of distilling for me what I needed to do was listen to people who had actually lived direct experience in doing something unusual and strange among something people that's simple but that's still really hard to like oh yeah well it was smacking me in the face and I you had an L6 promotion waiting on you right at Microsoft I was trying to make it to level 60 yeah level 60 is like hardly L it's like level three or something it's brutal and by the way paler I've got friends that are there and and I've learned a little bit about reading like it did not Peter teal I think it's easy for me to say Peter teal back then seemed like an obvious winner but the paler idea didn't like it seemed it seemed like it didn't work for like two years or something like that like it was definitely it seemed like it had this normal startup trajectory where it's like it's not working maybe it's working it's definitely not working all right now it actually has legs you know the YC trasar thing like it seemed like it had those normal normal like issues except for like maybe five years yeah it took many many years before it started driving revenue and be you know became real um yeah the trickiest thing like YC companies always come to me and ask like what could I learn from the paler experience and I'm like are you is your name Peter teal and are you willing to put you know tens of millions of dollars of your own money into it before and sort of wait and be incredibly patient and ignore all the signs that you're you know weren't getting revenue and not you know actually working for so long to the point that you know suddenly it started absolutely working and working like 10 times better than you thought it would like that's just not a thing that people are really capable of doing on certainly their first million dollars or their first you know paler is sort of like the the most amazing version of like the second or third startup that people do like your first startup you got to just gut it out sometimes it's like how do you like get to your first million dollars right well that is the name of the podcast and so I'm curious what's your advice or take on that like how did you do it how did you think about it and knowing what you know now how would you go make your first million yeah I mean what's funny is in the end like paler ended up being huge but it took it didn't really IPO until many many years later like I mean I designed the logo in 200 I joined as employee number 10 we would do these ridiculous things like go to uh Stanford and give out pizza and then we were like 10 people 15 people working there but the pizza box would have our paler logo that I designed and like like join the next Google and people would like eat the pizza and they'd like give us dirty looks like how dare you what the heck is wrong with you guys and then um let's see my first win I mean the paler shares did turn out to be something but it did not seem like it was going to for a really long time I think my first actual million dollars was selling a few million dollars worth of Twitter stock at IPO and so it was actually really late like 20 I mean for me I started working in Tech like when I was 14 so like 1996 95 and then I mean I think it yeah literally took like 18 years of like working as an engineer and not having money and having like $50,000 credit card debt coming out of college and I think that might have even been one of the reasons why I didn't uh quit to join Palante here I was like it it felt you know in 2004 I still had like $340,000 credit card debt and like maybe $50,000 in student loans and I just like I was like well like 70,000 is a lot but you know how am I gonna actually you know I don't know if this job will even exist in six or nine months and like I could be a lifer at Microsoft and of course in retrospect it's like being a life from Microsoft would be sort of like a life of torture at some level so yeah my first million was actually Twitter stock uh so I started a company in 2008 called posterus it was a Blog platform I used to use it I love posterous yeah it was a dead simple blogs by email um you just emailed poster.com you didn't have to log in or like learn how to use software and then we just reply back with like here's your blog like here's your website and you know you could send it to your friends and you could it was sort of like an email list too so you could do it with your family a lot of people used it to like share photos with their uh family it grew 10x year on year two years in a row until uh Instagram came out I remember when Instagram came out posterous was actually one of the little check marks uh lost to the SS of time I think it was like you know posterous Tumblr um four square Twitter and sharing page and um I remember Chris Saka one of our investors emailed us about it and was like hey what do you think about Instagram and before I could uh reply my co-founder replied it sucks I was like and we got a on line reply from Saka saying I'm very disappointed in you guys and then just was like you know sleep deprived and think about it again but like I think about that all the time now cuz you know when you're working on a startup like you know we didn't actually even totally understand why we were growing that fast um in retrospect it was actually because the iPhone was new and people were taking lots of photos and there were no apps that made it easy to upload and then Instagram was sort of the first free app that created a network that also even had a little bit of utility with their filters and it was all free and uh basically you know we got run over by the eventual winner and you know I think that's one of the big dangers for Founders period is when we launched in 2008 you know Michael Arrington at Tech crunch wrote about it and he framed us off the bat he was like posterus is T you know way easier to use than Tumblr and so we sort of made a mistake and took like that competition and then made it our identity and it's something that is vice I have to give to Founders all the time now which is like we weren't competing against Tumblr we were competing against how people were getting photos off of their phone actually but you know when you're not careful you sort of allow Media or other people to sort of frame your reality and then you just play the wrong game like Tumblr didn't even want to be Tumblr that ended up having zero Enterprise Value I think that's also one of the cool things about silcon Valley is like you can even sort of screw it up you know it if I really uh introspect on what I wish happened um you know we had about a million users who were like super dedicated to posterous we easily could have you know sort of charged $5 or $10 a month for it we would you know we were a team of like 12 people we easily would have been profitable and then uh I I remember because we were hanging out with our friends at Weebly like uh David renko and Dan vry who were amazing I mean they they were they only Ever Raised uh you know a tiny amount of money out of demo day and never raised a series a and what they eventually sell for like 300400 million yeah to square like sort of I think pre-ipo and then square of course like went on its crazy run so these guys are like made you know hundred times more money than me and my co-founder imposter is like you know rightly so they did it not through like continuing to raise Venture dollars but by um being profitable cash flowing by compounding by focusing on their users and like playing their own game instead of playing the game that was like can be sort of chosen for you by either your investors or social media or by reporters and tech tech press like you know just play your own game like make up your own mind so you know if I did it again like we easily probably could have done that and then instead I think we ended up pivoting out of um you know that posterous idea in you we were just wanting to to chase this idea that we could be the free social network and I I distinctly remember meeting uh Peter Fenton at Benchmark and he passed on our series a because we didn't have a good answer for this he asked you know are you a platform or are you a network and uh we said both because you know that's what Founders who like don't have strong opinions end up saying I think like it's a multiple choice test you just circled A and B can't be wrong that way but I don't know this is all you know 2020 hindsight I mean we use I use these stories all the time to try to help Founders get on the right path to real Enterprise Value all the time now right so you know it's not just make something people want and raise a series A and B and like look like a successful startup it's actually makes the something people want and that's the end in itself and if you do that like you're going to make money and you know hopefully you can uh compound that and like you know create real Enterprise value for yourself and that's that's the game we we want to ask you a bunch of a bunch of questions about different stories because you probably have like a lot of stories but what's interesting about that story is um you you left P paler is a very I don't know if it felt it that way then but now it's a very serious company where like they prevent terrorist attacks at times so like it's a very serious product uh what you were working on after that you could like someone could be like well that's just like a blogging platform or that's just this like that's that's quote less serious did you ever like I mean I guess I'm self- projecting because I feel this way sometimes where I'm like I'm doing something that's not serious but you kind of have done both and you've done now you're back to a relatively serious thing it's a YC is a multi-billion dollar company um how do you balance like like working on something that seems fun and cool versus like a serious big thing I mean I think that goes back to what we were saying a little bit earlier which is just like be careful what frame you accept it's all made up but uh you get to make it up and and then um you know for posterous and blogging like they said the same thing about Facebook and I remember spending time with boss and you know a bunch of the you know our friends who were early facebookers they never accepted the frame that Facebook was not a serious and important thing you know they their narrative was very clear like they had a very strong cult and the cult was just clearly once every few decades I think very explicitly Zuck would say this like once every few decades like everything would change media would totally change and like they were right like this social layer came up and um you this is sort of the reason why I feel like if you're running a business today you kind of have to be a Creator because if you're not a Creator you got to buy eyeball somehow and guess who's got the Monopoly on eyeballs you know Larry and Sergey and Mark Zuckerberg you got to go pay you got to pay the toll to you know go across the bridge like you know the second price auction mechanism in uh the ad networks for like all incremental attention is so valuable that these are like the most durable powerful Network effects businesses that like cannot be disrupted so wait are you telling all YC Founders to go and build an audience online oh if you're doing consumer you you basically have to right sometimes even if you're Dev tools like you would you say the same thing if you're a B2B like isn't it even more valuable because you need a smaller more targeted audience oh yeah that'd be great it's just harder to Target that that's a that's a pretty interesting thing you didn't say this I'm putting words in your mouth but if you are saying oh yeah yeah we have Mark is coming to speak at our uh mini conference later today and you know we're going to talk about it it's like how do you actually get incremental customers and distribution really matters for Consumer businesses but that's also why you know we've had a dir in really breakout consumer businesses for 10 years um you know I think that this will change I mean with ai ai does change things I don't think it's broken the distribution Advantage you know I think that the big tech companies have a total strangle hold on the incremental user and you have to pay them still uh I mean it's just purely Market Dynamic right like you know we're selling widget X or game X or dating site X or whatever it is but you know our you know buddy from college or you know or someone from Halfway Around the World in Eastern Europe can like take what we've done and like do the exact same thing or go to our supplier in China and like get the same Drop Shipping relationship and so at that point like the second price auction means like well I want that customer no I want that customer no I want that customer guess what it's an auction like every incremental dollar that is gross margin Google or Facebook will just extract because it's a perfect Marketplace and that's just the world we live in right now and then you know I think that the purest form of alpha that exists still is saying interesting valuable things that um you know and the YouTube algorithm and the X algorithm and you know um to a less extent like Instagram I mean I think Tik Tok is actually pretty wild like they're just giving away distribution over there especially for brand new creators um I think meta is probably really dropping the ball on how they're thinking about creators they just like I don't know what's going on over there seems like they only want to satisfy the people who are already big which you know is not that helpful for people who are trying to do new things um but yeah that's that's sort of the regime we live in um you know for B2B what we see at YC is that you know probably 70 or 80% of companies are B2B and our most well- attended mini conference every batch is actually the sales mini conference um you know uh Pete kazanji founder sales like that book we give a copy of that to like literally every founder a lot of is about a mindset shift like most people have never been rejected 95 out of 100 times like it's just so like Soul crushing to get know that many times in your life but it's also you know for 80 90% of businesses today you better get good if your website conversion rates 5% you're doing phenomenal you go out and knock on 100 doors and get 95 NOS you feel like you're the biggest failure in the world and it's the same conversion you should because you got five you got five Enterprise contracts paying you $10,000 to $100,000 a year like you're the biggest winner in the world like that's how this stuff works we got to ask you about some of the people that you've been able to meet I'll tell you what I want and I hope that you give it to us I don't know if you will or you won't but like so me and Sam kind of are in what I'll call like the way that most people live their life which is you wake up every day you got your project your business it doesn't matter if you're doing you know $10,000 a month or $100,000 or10 million do a month doesn't really matter you wake up every day and then we all look for kind of like this entertainment inspiration thing and we get a lot of it from Twitter from podcast and one of the best things is when you hear about the way that some of the people you admire operate or the way that they they handle things or the way that they dealt with a situation or something about their personality and of course it's sort of you know a caricature it's not a perfect picture and you know whatever they're not perfect people but it is badass to hear those stories and we hear them about Elon but you run in a really amazing Circle where you know Paul Graham Sam Alman like all of the YC Network are people you've been around you've been around them before they were you know big and and and since I would love if you could tell us a couple of like either personality traits or stories that stand out for some of the people so I'm curious it's a longwinded way of saying can you tell me some cool stories about some of these characters that you R absolutely the funniest story I remember from working with uh Paul Graham in the office I mean he gave me my first shot as an investor and as an adviser to startups I was burnt out from imposturous we my co-founder and I had like a falling out and um he wanted to become Google groups and I was like dude I don't even think that Google wants to be running Google Groups like what we should just charge money but um yeah Paul like I think really did like Paul and Jessica basically like did all the admissions worked with all the companies this like 2011 you know even the whole yissy campus was not a campus it was like a warehouse with some carpet and some like custom like very cheap I mean there's just tables and benches the benches were so rickety that like if you sat on one side like and the other person on the other side like you know stood up like you'd fall over like there's just like a bunch of funny things about YC early it was like this tiny thing um and to paint a picture like people still when I said I was going to go work at YC uh as a designer in Residence my friends in venture or startups would say oh that's nice it sounded like I was going to volunteer like a high school camp or something it was like a high school basketball camp or something I was like Oh that's oh that's nice that's so you know I hope you enjoy that like you're doing Comm service good for you good for you exactly and um you know Dropbox had happened as a you know and it had become a billion- dooll company but uh Airbnb I think was just about to become a billion doll company and uh you know I I I think this is lost to the sands of time but I remember Sarah Lacy had created had a written a book called like one year lucky to your good so that you know 2011 I think was the one year lucky to your good moment for YC where people realized oh this isn't like some Fringe thing it's actually starting to turn out like basically the most dominant startups that exist it's like a very concentrated form of Silicon Valley and about that time um yeah we had there was literally one person who did all the books all the finances all the audits all the CFO stuff and uh she needed a copy machine so she got one of those like uh sort of waste height copy machines that um you know looked corporate and it had like these little stickers on it and then I remember Paul Graham came in he's like what is this why is this here and it was like sort of this totem of um corporateness he's like I remember seeing these at Yahoo and I hated them like he started like scraping off the sticker that had like the phone number of the little company that uh would maintain the the copy machine and uh I guess it just jumps out at me as like this very interesting Quirk of Paul that was like absolutely right and you know I sort of stay up at night thinking about like how do I make sure that YY never feels corporate PG like PG would show up in like shorts and uh birken stocks all you know all day I think he he uh wore khaki pants to my wedding so my mother my uh my sister-in-law was like excuse me sir this is a private wedding and I'm like no no no that's my boss um so I mean there's this I think what I learned from Paul was that um I think there is an Insidious nature to like formality and um corporateness and just like having to wear a suit or the convention right like I think there's incredible value in being very very unconventional Whenever there is prestige Andor convention you should be wary of that thing because you know there's got to be some other weird soul sucking things that are associated with that that you no one by default would sort of choose to have you know a dress code or like what you know what are some other examples of this like you know basically you should beware of about your own formality and um try to fight against it it's just like try to be super matter of fact um and I think that that that's one of the things that just makes companies bad I I wonder like as people who run your own businesses you ever think about that like you go into a meeting and you just think like was that a meeting that if I were not me running this place like would I want to be in that meeting well it's the same thing as what you said about the framing thing you you behave like you think you're supposed to behave versus what uh kind of makes sense um you start playing business a little bit it's it's sort of like you know when you start a company a lot of people play business business by getting like a business card before they get a customer and then you kind of snap out of it you're like no dude I got to make the damn thing you start making the damn thing and you start getting some customers and then you kind of go back to playing business again yeah um which which is definitely part of the Silicon Valley thing you know like okrs measuring things quarterly like there is a bunch of like lameness that I myself fall victim to and you have to like pull yourself out of that trap but but some of it is like useful I guess if you're Airbnb you you have if you have 6,000 employees you you do slow down but it's hard to know what's Truth Versus what like or what you should do versus what you have to do type of thing I will say that I think um it's possible for people to do uh insane business now with like two Pizza teams like I think that we you know probably in your community or maybe you guys yourselves will end up making these like hundred million to like billion dollar a year businesses that are totally empowered by large language models that like do not need more than 20 people working at them I think that this is literally the most exciting news that you know we're pretty sure is going to happen the next few years especially right now and like that is the one thing that these giant companies that have like thousands of people like it is completely like Corporate America is completely unprepared for this moment like they're just going to get run over by a thousand startups that are way more agile that you know aren't completely drowning in convention they can just do the right thing for the customer and the cost basis will come down a ton you know the the trickiest thing is like I'm not sure if it's inflationary deflationary like what's going to happen here right like prices in theory should come down things should get a lot more uh competitive I mean on the flip side like the hope is that all of our you know products and services get um a lot better cheaper faster real fast I mean this is the moment like literally we talk to people who are Eng managers and like CTO and like even engineering teams I you know I think that it's almost generational like we get it's like in the water for us right now cuz we spend all of our time with like 22 25 28 year olds who were like the me from you know 15 years ago like we're just helping the Next Generation right now and they were like born on the internet they were born with large language models you know um and then there's sort of uh you know frankly I'm 43 like my generation of sea levels like I don't like I don't think people are prepared or even aware of what's about to happen right now and it's like super super good news for anyone who's running a business who's super agile because you don't have to be doomed to calling in the business process automation call center you don't have to like hire the team in the Philippines anymore if anything like that's one of the more direct advice we give to uh people looking for startup ideas in the batch right now if people are pivoting we're like okay well you're selling to let's say like accounting firm um you know but you're having trouble with Enterprise sales what if you targeted people who already spend you know hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on a call center in the Philippines or Eastern Europe or anywhere else like why don't you just reach out to people like that and just replace what they rely on you know there with large language models that have great evals and great workflow like that is just you know I think we will have many companies driving tens to hundreds of millions of dollars like literally in the next like two years it's just like hundreds of them thousands of them are going to pop up right now just doing that That's so exciting what companies um are you super excited about that we should watch out for or we should go check out because you live in the future you're you're further in the future than we are obviously like uh the tooling for this is important like there's going to be a lot around um helping people build the stuff um youat like evals in particular like doing it test driven is important you know um the danger for most Founders right now is it's very easy to make demo Weare that you can use to raise money and then you're tempted to sort of you know quote unquote raw dog your prompts like you will just write code that has some prompts and you won't write any tests and then uh the funny thing that we're seeing right now that I think is super true is again like going back to what we were saying earlier like it's important to build your worldview on how the world Works directly from customers and their customer data so the sort of rinse and repeat thing that's like maybe 80% of Y what YC companies are doing right now that I think anyone could do is go and find real people who like are running businesses and they're spending hundreds of thousands of dollars a year on giant teams of people doing like rote repeating knowledge work and then get access to their data get access to the flow of their work watch how they do it and then literally write test cases using and if there's hallucination or uh the llms aren't actually able to like consistently do the thing you want you actually have to chop down the prompts more like you're asking for the llm to do too much like the LMS are capable of maybe like 120 IQ level work right now and if you're you know giving it like too much in the context window and asking it to Output too much it's just like uh do it steps right this is literally what 01 and uh you know reasoning already does using chain of thoughts the interesting thing and weird thing that I'm tracking right now that I'm a little bit worried about is it is entirely possible that the next generation of uh large language models from anthropic and open Ai and meta are you know one and then two orders of magnitude uh in in like compute and number of parameters and then we just get like you the daru amade scaling laws paper specifically says like you know these big large language model uh AI labs are going to spend a billion and then 10 billion dollars on the next Generations and like if we get like continued step function Improvement like the trickiest thing is like all the stuff that even what we're doing as Founders are doing like you know maybe the models will just do for themselves and uh you know I think that my hope is that um you know there's not enough agency in these things and then you know maybe what will happen what what we hope and what we think will happen is that the people who establish Brands and Moes and evals right now when the next Generation models happen their cost structure just comes down by like 10x and then they already have like the revenue and the the market captured in some way that they're like sort of beating the software incumbents that they're going up against they elves have like tens to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and then like basically the standard Moes apply like look at Porters 5 forces and you're like you know uh your dat you have way way better access to data your your systems are way smarter it cost a lot of money to take a risk and switch off of those systems and then you you have a Salesforce that is way better and smarter and so if you take all you know that's sort of the Gambit right now like if you do prompts in evals you are pulling forward the future by a few years you're trying to like grab as much land as you possibly can right now and uh and then from there like hopefully you can hold on and build the next Microsoft or the next Salesforce or you know the next 10 you know 10 to 100 billion dollar company was it obvious when Sam Alman left uh YC to do this I wish I was smart enough to predict that this was what was going to happen did you think that he was going to be the man like he is now like you know Paul Paul Graham has that essay where he's like here's five people I'd bet on and one of them the fifth one was like a 25y old Sam Alman and the other three were like you know uh Bill Gates and Steve Jobs and then he said this kid so did you were you like whatever Sam does is going to be a generational company or were you like H might be it could be mildly successful I mean I think it could I bet in full transparency like I'm gon to be super honest I was like man I don't I don't quite get it you know i' he uh when he was sitting in my my shoes as president of YC uh he'd come back and I remember sitting in the group partner room and he'd say like well this is what Elon was talking about and this is what Larry was talking about and you know they were all talking about Ai and they were you sort of talking about these sci-fi scenarios um and I'm like man I saw Terminator 2 too but that was a movie okay and uh I think that I'm changing my tune at this point like you know I wish that it was smart enough to be you know actually totally a Believer you know I'm a Believer now um do I believe that we're going to end up in like a doomsday scenario like I still don't really believe that there's that much agency in these things which is your judgment now is questionable you know first Peter first paler now open you you thank thank God that you've like already made a so many other successful Investments that I know that Gary's got good judge and like the future a little bit because uh I'll come around eventually you know like I'm just a year off yeah he was paler employee 10 after he said no to the co-founder well he ended up there right so I mean now we're you know we are full Believers in large language models but you know I think the thing that's a little bit lost to the sands of time is that you know what what Sam was absolutely right about was um jumping on this thing that the smartest people in the world were already talking about like eight nine years ago and then he built it you know he invested the money he um you know brought together the people it was no small task to bring together the smartest AI researchers in the world and then not only that it was like semi Miracle you know you could ask why didn't meta do this before why didn't Google do this before why didn't Microsoft research do this before like all of those people had virtually Limitless access to resources and um to weave this back together I think there is something really terrible and limiting about like giant organizations that are not capable of evolving and making smart decisions I mean that's what big Tech is like they're sort of like big daycares for the most technical smart people in the world and it's like here's here do you know play some volleyball we'll cook you lunch like here you know here's do your laundry at work you know like you know let's totally infantilize the smartest people in the world and like that's a waste of time like what needed to happen was um the ability you know one of the things that God explained to me why uh it was open AI that came up and like invested you know Millions first and then tens of millions and hundreds of millions into the large language model and you know Transformers for language um if you were at Google you needed to work this bureaucracy it was like highly political you know you had hundreds of other researchers all of whom were all as smart as you and you had a finite sort of limited set of compute and you know what you would find is that um Google would do really breathtakingly amazing work but then you'd have like 30 different authors you know and if youd read the paper there'd be like these sort of like strange things that seem like it was a little bit tacked on but that's the only way you could get the compute resources to actually pull off a training run on like the model that you want wanted to do like you had to do some weird things to accommodate like people who were going to commit their training resources for their like random little thing and so it's funny to see that you know human progress is more or less a little bit uh impeded by the bureaucracy and lack of governance and lack of agency that large organizations just sort of like impose on people like you don't have a choice isn't it crazy that it was easier for them to invent a discover Transformers and and this large language breakthrough than it was for them to navigate the bureaucracy to actually like create a product out of this or do anything useful with it like that should tell you kind of everything you need to know I mean the wild thing is like even with an open AI like they did everything right like gp3 was very impressive 3.5 was even more four was incredible but like they were going to just put it behind an API and like explicitly for many years open AI was supposed to be a you know we're search lab not a product company and uh you know it took the relatively herculan efforts by product people inside open AI to even release um you know chat GPT which turned out to be the greatest consumer launch of maybe the in the history of consumer launches actually hey you said um and and I know we got to wrap out a second but you said um you keep talking about this thing it's pretty amazing about uh talking to the smart people and like what what are they what are they talking about um you have access to more of those types of people than probably most anyone on Earth what's the conversation right now or is it is it all AI still yeah I mean ultimately that's sort of the number one thing that we're pretty excited about I mean that you know a few people who are really smart can sit in a room and I mean make a thing that literally does what humans do all day you know I I would make a pitch that often the best things that could be automated are actually very rope they're sort of the knowledge worker equivalent of like hand looming a carpet or something it's like all I do all day is look at an email box see if someone paid their bill reconcile that against a ledger in QuickBooks like can you imagine you know millions of people like tens of millions of people on the planet like that's their nine to5 you know like that that is not a good use of a very smart human being uh generally speaking and like those are are the things that are most easily replaced by really great prompting great evals and frankly I think um you know there are going to be 20 person software engineering focused startups that basically turn um you know billions of dollars in payroll into uh billions of dollars in software revenue and hopefully those people go on to do much smarter and much more interesting jobs than like passing butter all day that's amazing Gary uh if you have one minute can you tell the spoon bending story I think this is the a very powerful story that you have uh the spoon bending party I don't know if you you know this oh God it's hilarious I mean I you know I've been to Burning Man a few times I love burning man it's my favorite place to take a break from consensus reality and realize that it's all made up but you get to make it up and uh you know there's a lot of like weird Fringe stuff a lot of like 60s like esoterica you know uh you're just wandering around the desert on a with your buddies and you know I think uh we randomly walked into a spoon bending party where uh they were you know it was a huge group of I think it was almost like a magician at the front like sort of helping people you know the the shtick was that they were going to teach you how to uh bend a spoon with your mind I was like okay that's cool like let's go check it out they passed out these spoons um and then it was like a magic trick they said uh okay now bend your spoon with like look at your spoon and uh bend it with your mind and then in between they would say like okay well sometimes you need to use your hands and like warm up the spoon to bend it and then basically uh I think what you're supposed to do literally is just bend the spoon with your hands and that's what you and then what's funny is by the end of it um half of the people like I had I had a bent spoon cuz I was like oh yeah like they said like oh I should you know sort of warm up the spoon with my hand hands and bend it with my hands and just to get it started yeah just yeah just to get it started right and then by the end like half of the room had bent spoons and the other half didn't and the ones that didn't were like how did you do that that's absolutely incredible and I was like guys it's a bit it's a bit like you have to you know first know that you can bend the spoon with your mind but then you bend it with your hands guys like that's that's literally like the stick actually and it's a little bit of an allegory for uh you know bias to act and what you're supposed to do in real life like real life is sort of like this exercise like they say like you can go change the world and you can do it with your you know with your very ideas but like you know that alone is not enough like you actually have to go with your hands and go talk to users and you know sit and build a thing and so you know don't forget the second half and the wildest thing is like more than half of the room could not do it and so if you are the person who's able to bend this you know bend the spoon with your mind like guess what you also used your hands like you got to do that and you know and actually like that's maybe like the greatest gift it's just like dude Gary you're the [ __ ] man you are the best I love talking to you you make me feel uh really great you give me energy and um we're very very very thankful that you uh took the time to do this thank you guys so much for having me always great to see you guys and you know congrats on all the success and excited to see where you and your your community go I mean you know we're we're all building the future out here well thank you for saying that take care Gary [Music]

your life is already a threea story you have the rise to meteoric fame Mike poser Mike poser breakthrough arst of the Year award then you have the crash my career had plummeted I had a hit and my career plummeted and then you have the rebirth one of spotify's top 10 most stream songs of all time Mike hosner is enjoying Sweet Success at the time it was scary the fame the Adoration the money really the fame really the fame the money and all that other stuff was nice but the fa was the fame man so what I'm supposed to do is ask you to walk me through that but I already know that story so I said what am I actually curious about and it's why you would climb Everest why you would walk across America what's the philosophy that drives somebody to do those things I've never been asked that before okay let me let me try to tell the [Music] truth I want to ask you about some things back when we were at Duke so for people who are listening who don't know this me and Mike actually were a Duke at the same time same year freshman class I remember hearing stories that there's a a white boy rapper in the dorm next door and we were like who is he trying to make it whatever didn't really think too much of it and then I suddenly started to see a couple of interesting things the first interesting thing I saw was that at some point I opened up my laptop and I went to iTunes and I saw you at the top of iTunes but it wasn't the top of iTunes it was the top of iTunes U and iTunes U was like this little part of iTunes that was like for lectures in Silicon Valley we call this a growth hack sometimes you got to be clever and you got to use your turn your disadvantage to an advantage can you teach me about this because I've always known half the story I didn't know the full story yeah absolutely so a giant hip-hop fan so started rapping when I was eight got to Duke you know 12 years later and I started to sing but really I was singing almost from a hip-hop perspective I'd use these complex rhyme schemes polyic rhyme schemes even in my first hit song cooler than me it's got a complex rhyme scheme so you got designer Shades just to hide your face so it's not just the last syllable of the r that rhymes Shades and face but also designer R rhymes with Hydra this is a rapper thing right and so I was combining hip-hop with Melody in a way that I thought was dope I thought was cool and I had heard anyone do it before really and so I started to share my music and I was getting a little bit of traction on these hip-hop blogs which were important in hip-hop at the time blogs like two Dope Boys um naite even um Kanye's blog which is a really big deal at the time and this is an era of uh piracy so everyone you probably remember when we were at Duke we did not pay for music you know so You' go on Lime wire Li wire bit bit Torrance that whole thing and so I knew no one was going to pay for my music because we weren't paying for Kanye's music we weren't paying for Jay-Z the artists we love the most we were stealing their music so no one's going to pay for my music because no one knows who I am so I understood that and I understood it was important I was on these hip-hop blogs but then I was kind of a shy kid and I was really into my music so I'd always stay in and then my friends would come back they'd stumble into my room drunk interrupt my song and push them out and this whole thing and one day I go to this uh kid's room down the hall named Xander he was a really cool kid you know and uh seemed to have a more robust social life than than I did and it was only cool xanders I never met a not cool Xander yeah exactly dude so and so he said to me um hey Posner at the party last night um they played Your Song and all the sorority girls knew the words I said what really that's mind you I've been making music 12 years now that's never happened he goes yeah and dude they played it twice they play it twice in a row and everyone's saying the words so then I said wow okay the next day my mom calls and she says in passing by the way I really like that song you make cooler than me I don't know how she heard it her you know friend sent her it was my MySpace at the time so I said okay that's kind of peculiar it's on the hip-hop blogs the sorority girls like it and my mom likes it the next day my friend Big Sea Calls who I came up with in Detroit and he had gotten a record deal with Kanye he's a rapper from Detroit and a dear friend of mine and he said I love cooler to me he goes I think that could be a hit song I said hold on if Sean mom and the sorority girls all like the same song something's going on here that never happened before cuz I've been making music 12 years and nobody seemed to particularly give a [ __ ] besides me including my mom right always supportive and loving she you know pay for music less supportive but never told me she liked one of my songs I'm I'm 20 years old I'm like wow so I realized the way these hip-hop blogs work was you'd go on the site there'd be a blog entry with your song and then you kind of had to do some some kind of a right-clicking and there was always these weird links that would throw you off into some sketchy websites and you had to click the right thing and then save you know file as and that that's how you download the song but it was really convoluted and hidden behind advertisements and I just realized that these sorority girls were never going to do that they were never going to hey they're never going to go to these hip-hop blogs and if you know Snowball chance in hell they would they wouldn't ever be able to download the song so I realized you know iTunes was just starting to come out and it was this safe place you could get music and so I knew I need to get my music there but then I had this other rub that I alluded to earlier which is no one's going to pay for it so I need it to be free like it is on the blogs but I need to be on iTunes and then I saw iTunes you all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends and luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think so iTunes U was this section of iTunes that was set up for professors to post their lectures and if you weren't there you went to a different School you could you could listen to this professor's lecture and it supposed to be purely educational and the cost was free for everything on iTunes you there was no charge it was an educational arm of iTunes so I said I got to get my music there now this is where life capital L comes in I'm from Southfield Michigan it's a suburb of Detroit I was born in Detroit I moved to Southfield when I was 2 years old I grew up there live there till I'm 18 I go to Duke University I do some searching and I find out who's in charge of iTunes you for Duke so if you're a Duke professor and you want to post your lecture how do you get up there I find out it's a man named Todd St I called email to remember you could type in any name in the directory you could get the email so I get Todd's email I C email him and we a phone call he gives me his number and his number is the same area code as mine hey Mia 248 Eric he go yeah he goes I'm from Southfield Michigan where are you from I said come on know said get the Goosebumps still to this day I said look this is what I'm trying to do I'm a student artist and I'm going to share my album you know and I want to put on iTunes you he goes oh yeah man from Southfield you're student we can put on iTunes you no problem life set that up for me man so I got my music on to iTunes and you just search on iTunes like any other thing but when you went my album came up the price was free any other music out cost a one $1 yeah 99 whatever it was mine was free and so then I got busy on Facebook I created a Facebook event and there was a link to that album and I activated all my communities so I was from Michigan and a lot of my friends went to different colleges across the country including Michigan Michigan State gosh um friends at Northwestern friends at you know Marquette friend you just wherever they went and then my friend I was in fraternity and there were these we had pledges so these older guys that do mean things these pledges make them like do you know thousand push-ups or whatever I said look you guys are going to do something for me you're going to pause the push-ups you're going to send the invitation to this Facebook event to everyone in your Facebook Network every single person and there's a way I I had a protocol five steps and you could send it out and all of you are going to change your profile picture to my album cover and all my friends they all change their profile picture my album cover and my friends did the same thing my fraternity Brothers they all did the same thing so all their friends that were at different schools they sent it out and then here's that the last thing is the music was good right so if the music wasn't good none of this [ __ ] matters right but and my music wasn't always good like I said I'm 20 I start was eight so it's 12 years making songs a lot of songs to get to that one song where my mom likes it right and Sean likes it so this iTunes you thing yeah was a thing that was pivotal for me pivotal and so from there every pretty much every College in the US was listening to Mike Posner that year and it started off small there' be you know 50 people and I'd get a show at Dayton Ohio where I'd go to Dayton Ohio I'd be booked to play at some bar you know at colleges there's always a a hustler guy that throws the parties and you know so those guys would book me and are you even paid to do these at the time or at the start 500 bucks so I'd go my boy Pat Klein became my manager later he booked me at Dayton Ohio and I I go there and there's 25 to 50 people I do my set and they know every word to my song A month later he book me to come back there' be 300 people there every word to my song and so it just started to exp expand like that and um yeah the iTunes U was a was a really great hack I've never heard that that story that's that's amazing story so because because what you did then you kind of stacked these right so you did that then you started doing the shows which normally correct me I'm wrong normally you kind of you did it backwards right like it seems like normally you'd have a label they would get you set up with the tours you were kind of underground so you if I remember correctly because you already had tours and fans then when record labels are interested you're like yo I'm drisk like I'm more drisk than than the artist because look at this like I've already I'm already playing shows with real fans all around the country and I remember being at Duke and we would hear like d this dude flies out every weekend and just does a show at a different college and flies back and like takes his test like that's what you were doing we're doing two or three man it got crazy yeah I would do two or three except that senior year I had set up so I had all my classes Tuesday Wednesday Thursday I leave Thursday night rip Thursday night Friday night Saturday night I get three checks come back have a bunch of Cash go to the bank put in the bank come back in my house just dirty filthy house you know like go to class again it was just insane doing homework on the planes like it was insane insane it seems like one of the unique things about you is like you you may not be the best rapper or the best singer or the best kind of Beats producer guy but because you're good enough to be dangerous on all three you were able to be like a oneman machine that was able to to to get a bunch of practice reps in and get you know keep keep trial and error where you weren't dependent on somebody else's time or somebody else's interest or tastes or whatever is that fair no I don't think so how would you say it I would say yeah I'm probably yeah I'm definitely not the best singer def you know I can't dance or anything or do any cool runs uh but I'm a damn good writer writer that's like your A+ skill you know people connect to me I think because of because of the r you know yeah I can't if I did American Idol I'd lose you know right you know I can sing but not one of the things that inspired me when I was doing the research was that at some point in the middle of your career so not like before he made it but like actually after you had the initial burst of success it seemed like I read something that you went back and almost like took music lessons and singing lessons and enrolled in a college and you said something like you know I'm in this class and I'm not the best singer in the class I'm supposed to be this you know I supposed to be this guy who's the star right they all want to be artists I actually even have the the credentials but I thought that was kind of an amazing humbling move to to just of course why wouldn't I dedicate myself to the craft can you talk a little about that there was something in that that resonated with me because I think that's unusual yeah well there's two two things in that one I think it speaks to the plan just made where there were these people I my at that time in my career I had I was in a cold spot so I said hey let me use this time to get better at my skills and if I'm being honest yeah I don't know how to play like I had a hit song but I didn't know how to play guitar I didn't know how to really sing I was a rapper who had started singing I didn't know how to play piano so why don't I learn some of those things and I remember I was at a at a it was kind of like a campfire kind of situation and that guy uh Sai was there you remember him open gongo stuff and Tory Kelly was there and they were passing the guitar on the fire and Tory Kelly sang this song it was so beautiful and then I had just written a song that day I wanted to sing it and I was a I said could you play the guitar these course the thing and she's trying to do it for me cuz I couldn't play the guitar and I really wanted to sing my song but I couldn't do it and it didn't really work and I remember leaving I go that that's stupid that I can't do that that's never going to happen again I'm going to learn to play a guitar I need be able to sing a song at a campfire you know so that's one part of it you know this lesson go hey you know being an artist is about is it similar to being a human it's about growing it's about being a better artist than you were a year ago and you can always your relationship to the music deepens or the art any art form deepens your whole life art is not like the MBA you know it's not like you Peak at 30 and you know you're you can't jump as high anymore so no this is a lifelong thing you can all it can always get deeper so that's part A but then Part B was yeah I realized kind of to the point right before this point was I'm in a singing class I took Berkeley school music online this is great singers in there and yeah I was I was like you know in the bottom cortile of that class but I was a successful recording artist and those people all wanted my job and I realized I had something that most people don't which is my writing but I have a way of connecting the music I make whether it doesn't matter music is not about hitting the high like life it's not about hitting the perfect no or doing the run it's about does it does this part of my Humanity speak to that part of your Humanity I'm raising my hand and I'm taking my clothes off out here and it's vulnerable and going this is what it's like for me to be a human anyone else and if I do a good job someone else hears it and and I'm so glad you said it because that's how I've been feeling for years and I didn't know how to articulate it and now I don't feel as alone that's that's what an artist does and so I realized in that singing class I already know how to do that I can I can add colors and refinements and make things more sophisticated by you know adding to my skills but at the end of the day even if you got no skills and you can do that you're a great artist you're a great artist well I love your music videos for this reason like now that you say it when I think about uh when I became a super fan of Zs like you sorry by the way that's why you're a great artist we talk about the beginning you say I'm a little lowercase artist no you're making the thing and it obviously connects with other people you're obviously following your own curiosity and going hey I'm making a thing that it's a million podcasts in the freaking world dude right but you're doing something in a way that connects with other humans and you're not doing it because you're trying to you're doing it by trying to connect with yourself connect your own creativity and curiosity to the the art you're making or the the you know the pieces that you're making whatever you call them and so yeah and by the way I I used to approach it very differently I used to approach it very analytically logic Duke kid right like you know there's a certain set of skills that gets you into Duke and those skills were I was trying to sort of map the market out and the opportunity where's the white space and my my coach my trainer I've mentioned before he he's like the white space is you bro he's like the he's like the product is you pushed out that's it take take yourself turn yourself Inside Out whoever resonates with what you are that's your Target customer you don't need a market study right that who are the people who are my customers the people that love what I do and he he just flipped it on its head and I was like dude you're speaking a different language to me different I've never seen this in a book but I started to put some faith in that and that's when I did the podcast I was like what's the podcast supposed to be it started off as only interviews and then we would just get on the podcast sometimes just shoot the [ __ ] about dude did you see this app that did this it was just me pushed out that's what I'm actually interested in so I just started talking about it and then all of a sudden it was getting a different result because there was only one of those cuz there's only one of me right so that that was a big lesson to learn yeah that sounds kind of obvious and almost like a fortune cookie but but it takes courage you got to go do it takes courage and you have to stumble upon it yeah you had to you had to do the other thing so yeah it it it has to be stumbled upon I had this line one of my songs that said I got I'm in the yoga class headband now people say I'm offbrand how I am the brand therefore anything I do is on brand now I'm on brand now youo it's like uh uh I look at my heroes and that's what I am now people got a attached to a version of me cuz it hurts when they see a person who's free and I'm so grateful for all these lessons twice as much money half the possessions no drugs now the vision's clear all my gold jewelry just disappeared That's The Universe telling me to start Switching gears the deeper the human the deeper the songs I saw all of this three years ago it's almost like it was me reading my poem yeah I like that um how'd you get on the radio because that's a black box like how'd you even figure out how to get on radio oh the thing I was going to say to you before was you know the music industry has completely moved that way so these these days of a record label are Hey kid You Got Talent we're going to develop you for six years like that doesn't happen and now it's even more so you only get record deal if you already have an audience so that that no longer is you know the responsibility of the label that's not the responsibility of the artist and there's so much data now right so labels can be really prudent I'm going hey that that or that or that right okay you asked about getting on the radio so I graduate and I sign a record deal and I'm making this new album I'm starting to work with bigger producers I'm working with Benny BL and making these songs and thinking you know when I do my first real album not an iTunes You album it's going to be big and I'm start Mak all this new music and the original Cooler Than Me used to have this line in it it go it used to at the end of the verse would say You're So Vain you probably think that the song is about you don't you if I could write you a song to make you right I don't know if you remember that remember that yeah yeah is that not still the song that's that's the one I remember it's not most people don't know it that way because we went to then go clear it cuz that's a Carly Simon song You're So Vain so this was this two lines in the verse we got to go clear we say Hey you know I use this part of your song in my song want to give you credit for it can we work out a deal she yes her represent no problem um we'll just take 80% 70 or something like dude you like it's two lines of the verse so I had to change that right first thing I had to go behind Jamaica nobody knows who you really are who do you think you are you know so we had change that out and then I'm thinking that I'm going to make this new hit song Benny Blanco it's like brand big thing because I I have a record deal now and when I play the new version of Cooler Than Me without the Karly Simon my record label thinks they say it's not as good it's not as good anymore so I think we should use one of the new songs to be your first real single K than me's now been out for two years to us college kids I'm in New York City I'm about to go to some meeting or a studio or something hang out with a friend and my my manager says we got to do a meeting with this radio promoter his name is ianc we need to do a a meeting with this guy his job is he gets songs on the radio with you and usually the label's supposed to do that but we need to pay him to do it ourselves I said I don't want to go to that meeting I want to go to the studio I'm an artist you go to the meeting he goes this is more important I go no it's not he says yes it is I said why well cooler than me's your first single the label doesn't know it but I know it this is my manager Daniel Weiss man I said Cooler Than Me is old it's 2 years old it's been out 2 years and everybody has already heard it on the sidewalk in New York City looks me he goes nobody has heard it I'll go to the meeting we go to the meeting we hire ENC I think we paid him what was it five grand 10 grand and he's going get the song on a few radio stations no guarantee how much they're going to play it but he said I can get on a few St stations so he gets on a few stations and this thing starts catching on people are calling the station we like this song you know before Shazam really but they have some way they test it it's the tests are going crazy and these few stations um Patty Moreno and Sacramento and shorty they start playing this song 50 times a week that's a lot and then DJ reflex in La Power 106 he he plays a song does well here it starts catching on here now the label calls they go we told you cooler to me is your first single dude what a great idea right and that's what labels are great at he's not so great at starting fires but if you can start a fire they got a hell of a lot of gasoline so they they then they go in hyper mode do their thing start getting on all the other stations and that was how I got on the radio and at that time the radio drove mattered yeah it still matter matters but it you win Spotify and get on the radio or you win YouTube and you get on the radio then it was the opposite I told you I get more out of the research for these than I do the interview sometimes and at first I got discouraged by that because I was like oh man it's kind of anti-climatic all the fun was in the the foreplay not the real thing we're going to change that to we're going to change that today but then I got excited I was like oh wait that means when I'm doing the research look for look for the gold cuz there's usually like one thing that I'm like wow that alone made this worth it this whole trip worth and so for me that was this one which was um about I guess making art or making songs it was you know do you try to make a hit do you try to think about what the audience wants and the quote was I just do what's cool to me and sometimes the whole whole world agrees I like that can you talk about that a little bit like where that mindset comes from that's a good question because I could talk about that mindset really easily but you asked me something different which is where that come from and that I've never been asked that before for so we're off to a good start that's an answer I give other people when artists are struggling I tell them you know your job is to make the thing that you think is beautiful period that's it don't do what I think is beautiful you or your manager or your fans this it so that's an answer I give to others now you're asking me a question about my answer the root so okay let me let me try to tell the truth or fine was true for me in part it comes from messing it up undoubtedly I experienced a lot of success in my early 20s and I got addicted to it the fame the Adoration the money really the fame really the fame the money all that stuff was nice the it was the fame one of those had a higher high than the rest that freaking Fame dude and so I can remember trying to replicate the success I had from my first hit song which is song cooler to me if I could write you a song to make you fall in love that song in it I I I just wanted that feeling I wanted to be that guy that everyone was looking at and so I can remember going in the studio and going I you want to try to make a make a hit make a hit make some everyone else likes and whenever I tried to create from that vantage point the only thing I succeeded in making was something I hated and and sometimes I think wow even if I don't like it maybe everyone else will it kind of checks all the boxes it's the right BPM it's got a CO catchy Melody and a cool lyric it doesn't really meet my standards of for my Aesthetics what I think is beautiful but who cares what I think like this is about me being famous right and of course if you don't like nobody it's like you went from a guaranteed audience of one to zero to start yeah man and so and I think life or God I believe in God sometimes I just call it life so I'll use those interchangeably in this interview as life with a capital l you I thank God that it never gave me success with one of those H cuz it wanted me to learn that very lesson that could teach to others but gosh could you imagine if one of those things I didn't really like got really popular woo that would have been even worse right mhm you would have been trapped on that path I'd still be T I'd still be doing interviews about that song now still be singing that song at my shows now right the original plan for this episode was your life is already a threea story so from a podcaster point of view oh this is easy you have the the come up you have the the rise to to meteoric fame everything that everybody wants you're a pop star you're on stage shirts off everybody's crazy about you you're the man then you have the crash and then you have the rebirth right so your story is already like that and so what I'm supposed to to do is ask you to walk me through that mhm but then I have to do what's honest for me too which is I already know that story and I like that story I don't really want to talk I'll ask you some questions about it but I kind of already know that so it wouldn't be honest for me to ask that because I wouldn't be curious cool I've already know it great man so I said what am I actually curious about and I was like I wanted to know that like hey you you said something that resonated with me which is my job is not to make a hit it's to make something that's cool to me and sometimes the world agrees so that was the first place want to start the second one is uh you know I'm not a musician but I'd like to uh I'm maybe like a lowercase a artist I I write I have a podcast do things like that you're an artist capital capital thank you some exists now out of that used to just be an idea in your head you're an artist all right you heard it here first my cousin thinks I'm an artist here we go absolutely the thing that's been most helpful for me when I write is exactly that so if somebody asked me how do you write something great how do you write something that goes viral and the best thing I ever read was sit down and write one true sentence one true sentence and that just became like a calling card for me it was like oh I know where to start now let me sit down and try to write one honest sentence and that's surprisingly hard because the honest sentence is usually something vulnerable and if I look at your hit songs so if you look at you know I took a pill in ABA the one true sentence right at the beginning is you know I took a pill in ABA to you know show of ich I was cool or in your new song it's something like um there's a part of me underneath the part that I let people see that part is the oh my God and I love that underneath the part that I let other people see that is the good part uh and I was like man he's really good at the one true sentence is that is that a technique you use at all like honesty to write the song or or to to bake the the core of the song yeah you know there's all adage in studios gets thrown around and more so in Nashville and La they say don't don't try write a good song Write a true song and then it'll be good automatically my music listen when I was 13 I was I was a rapper already I started rapping when I was eight but I was around 13 I was started to consider creating a stage name and and I'd go six months I remember I had this rapper name is acrimony and then I had this other name for six months later I threw it out and I go my name forther here on out is mcmp right the world will know MC MP was about 13 and a half yeah like a screen name status yeah exactly exactly and it go and I had this thought to myself I said my my music isn't an act the stuff I WR even then was just what was happening in my life it was real to me so my I shouldn't have a stage name I should have my name and I I said I'm gonna go by Mike Posner that's my name and that's who I am and who I am in life is who I am in my music this came back one other time it was almost 20 years later it was right when I wrote I took a pill and ABA because my career had plummeted I had a hit and my career plummeted and I was known as you know for doing kind of frat songs and party songs I had this you know up upbeat dance Success Song cooler than me and then I wrote took a ABA and it's the stat singer songwriter song on the guitar which most people don't know yeah the original was and I thought dude like whatever is left of my career will be destroyed by and was it's funny now at the time it was it was horri it was scary it will be destroyed by me making such a drastic change in my music like no none of my fans that liked what I did before would like this it's so different and I started contemplating again maybe I should change my name for this project and I remember thinking oh I'll do maybe I'll change my name to the truth it's like no the truth is your name is Mike coer and so I you know I quickly got my head out of my ass on that one again and went hey you know like this is my story and and the 3x story you talk about you know is I've I've owned it for better for worse or tried to too yeah do you look for that moment where you're like I'm almost so scared to put this out I I got to change my ACT name it's so this this goes to a certain place where it's not safe have you now learned to look at that signal and be like maybe there's something here if if I'm feeling that yeah absolutely and yeah a a huge huge barometer of something I should be writing is that I really don't want to write this this moment was so painful like I don't want to talk about it I don't want to think about it so yeah that that it's it's not the only you know it's not to say the converse is not true which is the only thing that should be written is something that causes you great pain that's not true but often that is a that is an entry point that that is worth examining absolutely we had Tim Ferris on the podcast and I asked him a question I said Tim uh my my my one honest question I was like I'm supposed to ask ask you about 4our work week but I read it already I said the thing I really want to know is how do you decide what's next cuz I knew he was kind of thinking about what's next and I know that whenever Tim Ferris is trying to do something he's methodical he he doesn't just yeah you he doesn't just do it he's got like a way he's going to do it that's right and I was like I kind of just H to the next thing like how do you do figure out the next thing and he goes well I create a menu of options and he's like he's like and on that menu I make sure I have I leave room for the weirdest option I go the weirdest option why you going to do it he's like I'm not necessarily going to do it he goes but he goes I treat like the weirdest idea of what I could do next this is not what I normally do this is not what I'm known for so if you're still around you must have I I actually need to overweight you as a as an option for me for you when you try to figure out what's next like uh whether it's the next song or the next project like writing a book how do you decide where where to apply your talents what's hard now is What Choosing what not to do that's the hardest part is you know killing things and on paper I may be doing too many things right now I'm writing my book intensively every day a lot of time alone my computer I'm putting an album out we're expanding our business in a lot of different ways so on paper if I was making the menu I go cross two of them out but your question was how do you decide and the same internal compass that I use in the in the micro when I'm creating I'm writing a sentence in my book and I go that word is not quite right no not that and then boom that one it's an internal knowing it's a feeling so that that's it Mark TW said the difference between the almost right word and the right word is difference between lightning bug and lightning bolt right and is that the truth right yeah has it happened in your songs oh yeah like is there a song today that we all know that almost was took a pill in Sacramento didn't have the same room to it she just kept trying to make it work this doesn't hit no no but just on the in the song same way a lot of times in the Production gosh that's not the right snare drum sample will work for an hour go through every the ultra sounds and that's the one you just know there's this quotee that Rick Ruben has that I love which he says the best way to serve your audience is to ignore them uh meaning to to not try to reverse engineer what they might want or what they might like or what they might just make what you want or what you like and that is the best way to serve them you know when you hear something you're like oh that's probably the truth I think I just heard the truth okay now the rest of my life is coming to grips with that truth I don't need to search for the answer I got the answer it's just a question of how long I'm going to deny myself you know how many roundabout ways I'm going to avoid facing the answer now I know the answer uh has that been been easy for you kind of back to that first question about like making what you want music is pretty easy now and honestly um taking care of my finances has been a big part of that what do you mean by that I'm financially secure I don't need to make another dollar from my music again so logically I was able to just talk to at some point in the past talk to that part of that voice in my head and go hey dude like you never need to make a song that you don't want to make ever again you never need to be in the studio with a person you're not a fan of ever again ever and that made me a much better artist and I live in Silicon Valley there's people with more money than than God out there and they don't feel like they have enough I know a lot of people who have enough who have made the last dollar they will ever spend many times over but they still do things to chase more and you know they don't like to say they're doing it but if you watch people's actions people's actions will sort of speak uh what they're devoting their their talents to what's the uh what was useful to you to coming at coming to peace with you know having enough was it as simple as I wrote down how much I needed and how much I had and I my the logic part of my brain solved that or was it a different part of you that that got peace with with the money side of your life both twofold so I had you know the analysis where they do a Monte Carlo or whatever it's like if you spend this much or this many more years You' be okay so that was like a money manager did that for you or yes that was part of it right just knowing hey I'm okay you got to shift at some point right because when you're coming up you you say yes to everything you know what opportunity is going to work and then when you get successful you have too many opportunities you got to learn to say no there's there's Paradigm shifts along the journey and so that that was one of them that's the logical part and then the the illogical part or the spiritual part is realizing what true wealth or abundance or success is to me it's my Definition True success or wealth is Health it's the ability to have joy in a present moment that's if you can do that you're a wealthy person and if you're grateful if you're grateful what you have you're wealthy there's a perception in the business World which is that the chip on on your shoulder serves you I know investors that will invest specifically in people they know are kind of like sort of damaged semic screwed up but they know that that gives them this sort of Psychopathic you know drive and when somebody's really happy I know people who don't want to invest in somebody who's super at peace because they the returns might not be there I don't know if I believe that do you think that the best art comes from you know people who are in a happy place or the people who who have that pain do you think that the best success comes from the people who are have that big chip on their shoulder or or not what's your take on that I can't answer in terms of where to invest your money all I don't really know that much about that stuff but what I can speak to is architecting a a more beautiful life I don't have a perfect life but it's a hell of a lot more perfect than it was 5 years ago right so what I can say is I don't want a life that is hyper successful in the vertical of work and finance and a desert Wasteland in the areas of passionate intimacy Faith spiritual growth friendships fun physical health giving back right so I believe the way I look at my life and I I do measure this is work and Mission is but one vertical and the thing I screwed up in my 20s is I thought if I crushed it so hard in this vertical meaning I got all the fame all the money that I thought the points would carry over I thought yeah I can not show up you know to Thanksgiving and not return my mother's phone call cuz I'm she knows I'm busy I'm pop star Mike Posner right I can I cannot you know see my friends or ghost them for months on end they understand I'm pop star Mike Posner Grammy nominated Mike Posner International Superstar I can never like go on dates and just have one night stands after my shows for years on end and and never develop emotional intimacy or the capacity to communicate on an intimate level or vulnerable level with a another human being because I'm International Superstar Grammy nominated Mike POS there I can never give back with my time or not so much with my money either because I'm International and what you get is just a life that isn't that good winning the game of life is played on all these different verticals and some of them require different skill sets that you won't find in the work vertical it's not going to help you be a good husband it's not going to help you be a good father I have a mission right so it's not saying abandon this for the other it's how do you do it all in Balance how do you how do you have everything that's what I'm interested in that's what I'm building in my life I'm doing the best job it I've ever done am I perfect no but boy am I proud of myself there's a great clip on on YouTube of Jim Carrey when he gets some award and he goes up on stage and he gave almost the same speech you gave he's like you know I'm U he's like I this is my second Emmy you know I used to be oh yeah the Golden Gloves a golden Glo like plagiarizing that it reminded me great I I was one time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey and tonight I'm ter and he's like and when I go to bed at night I will dream about being three times and he has the great quote like I wish I I wish the whole world could be rich and famous so they would know that that's not the answer right um you know you got to taste that and you you found out yourself that's not the answer for you uh and and doesn't seem like St for most um I have this goofy uh analogy that I want to ask you about so so do you ever watch the show Survivor when I was a kid I watched it okay so I'm one of the doofuses that is still watching it in season 47 going on with you man okay so we all have a thing I got my thing some people got weird things this is mine I want to go on Survivor someday that's part of my my my angle here but there's this thing that they do on Survivor which is I think a good analogy for life so in life in Survivor the best thing every player wants is the immunity idol it's this one thing that if you had it you're safe you can finally relax you've got the one thing that everybody wants and the that's been the case for many years recently they made a Twist they call it the beware Idol which is basically you pick it up and it says beware this comes with some disadvantages M and the player has opportunity they can just put it down they don't have to take any of the disadvantages so far 100% of players not a single player has ever put it down even though it says on the label beware this thing has disadvantages that come with it that will hurt you in this game and every player can't resist they take it and I was thinking about I was watching Survivor I was prepping for this podcast and I was like I think Fame is the beware advantage of life it's the thing that yeah well we all think we want the money the fame uh the love of of others and it's it it could say it on the label beware people who become pop stars when they're young those aren't the happiest people but we would all take it over again right um and so there's something to that and I actually was curious like for you if you could go back if there was a the next Mike poser he's he's 21 years old and you get 15 minutes in a room with him just like this and you could tell him anything I'm curious what would you tell him and do you think you would listen I mean dude want the thing you opened up the interview with you know my Smiles don't result from Good Things They result in good things you have sovereignty over your own emotions and the way you respond to and interpret every event of your life and life Nal rakan says life is a one player game right and you need to exercise and practice that sovereignty you need to develop rituals that give you the best chance of of enjoying your life to the fullest and and being the joy in life not waiting for something good to happen so you can feel happy being happy so something good will happen not waiting for someone to do something nice for you so you can feel good doing something nice for someone else to make them feel good and then you feel good all you know by default yeah I I didn't have a handle on any of that stuff when I was 21 I saw a great example of that from you which was I think you either you missed a flight or you were delayed on a flight or something like that and I I love this example because so relatable everybody's been in this moment where yeah it's tra travel stressful and then travel often feels out of your control whether it's a flight delay or you miss your connection or whatever it is and there's the common cliche reaction to that and we actually all kind kind of have that reaction but it's not always the response can you tell that story cuz I think that example it stood out to me not everybody's going to relate to being a pop star or making great music but this was something everybody could relate to so I'd love if you could share this one I've been told in recording studio so many times the lyric that I'm trying to write isn't relatable Mike don't you can't put that in a song cuz no no one will relate to it yeah nobody else took a pill in a Bea to show aichi they were cool I was just me but everybody's done something that wasn't true to themselves to try to gain the attention to someone else and so w yeah KN the lyric on the surface is unrelatable the emotion underneath the lyric is universal and the same thing with all these stories you know my life is my life I'm probably I'm the only guy I know that got nomin for the gram he walked across continent and climbed Everest and I did that by Des right cuz I wanted I to be the only guy I wanted to have a life that was cool to me and unique to me and and yeah and part of it was ego that like hey I want to be unique and but also I wanted my life to be inspiring to me but every element every one of the stories we share today whether it's a story from you or a story from me or Survivor what have you has human emotions underneath that are Universal so the story you're talking about is uh yeah I did a post I never talked about this this is a podcast W Premiere I had this this horrible travel day man I the day before wasn't good and I didn't sleep and I woke up early and we had to drive 3 hours to the airport we're in Colorado and it was an accident I70 and we in this traffic jam and we're in the car 7 hours missed the flight and it was just you know I was feeling sorry for myself and it was just a it wasn't stuff was bothering me in other parts of my life it was a bad day man I didn't feel good physically emotionally everything was off and I remembered that I was on a zoom call U in Tony Robbins conference about um time and scheduling efficiency and in one of the breakout sessions one of the other participants said when you're having a bad day ask yourself what could I do to make this a great day and it just it flashed back in my head while I was in that car I said well this is okay this is bad day check the first part right I said what can I do to make this a great day and I said okay if I could use the fact that I'm having a bad day to do something nice for others that would be a really cool thing that would make me proud of myself and so I called my assistant I said yeah this is all messed up you know I'm supposed to I and I was missing family time you know I get only so many days of my family every year my mom my sister and I was missing one of them and I S bummed out I go look so we get to spend the night in Denver tonight can you find me a place where I can just go volunteer not with money actually show up go serve and Stacy she's amazing she found me uh um I forgot the name of the establishment but it was a setup for people that um were getting off of drugs and they could live there and they get have a house you know roof over their head and some meals while they find a job and they get some training and I just show up to you know like Ser Ser food and when I showed up there I was still tired I physically had a headache still all the same things but I was just proud I said hey I used my suffering my having a bad day as an excuse not to go to bed not to complain not to take it out on somebody else but I use that as an excuse to do something good for someone else so i' I did Alchemy today I turned my suffering into service I turned my suffering into connection and that Pride I felt in myself cuz I would usually not do that I would usually have a pity party in the hotel and look at my phone it it just gave me all this pride and I I say this you know when I speak a lot true happiness comes from growth true happiness comes from growth it doesn't come from getting everyone to like you it doesn't come from getting the most followers doesn't come from a million dollars it doesn't come from things going the right way for you the right way for you it comes from playing a part in the evolution of your own soul so it's saying hey I usually do things this way what if I did something this way and that day I can truly say was one of the best days of my year without a doubt I went to bed and by the way so much energy yeah there's certain things that uh take energy that that seem like they take energy but actually give it's like going to the gym anybody's you're tired you don't really want to go to the gym but you go to the gym suddenly you have energy it's like wait how'd that math work it supposed to take energy to go work out but I have more than I had when I started it doesn't make any sense but it does to anybody who's ever done it makes perfect sense it makes sense because if I would have stayed in the hotel room and played on my phone I would have got more and more tired because because I was engaging in an activity that I knew I don't care about but when I engage in an activity that I know is a going to do something to make my soul grow this unlimited energy so sometimes doing more is easier than doing less sometimes a hard goal is easier than an easy goal right my uh my trainer he told me this story once that I love very similar to your your your story just now uh he came to the to our workout in the morning and he's beaming and he's always a happy guy but I could tell a little extra pep in the step what's up man hey man what's going on dude I thought I was looking like more fit or something I didn't know what the reason was I was hoping secretly open it was me but then he was like he goes well for the last nine months I've been driving around with like an expired license and he's like um I didn't want to go to the DMV so I avoided that pain but then every time I drove I was paranoid all the time that I was going to get pulled over and if I got pulled over it's going to become this mess and so he's like was a little anxiety was eating at me like so today I woke up I just decided I'm doing it differently so his thing is always just do it differently so do it differently than you used to do it in the past that simple thing so instead of trying to do things perfectly just do it differently and you do that often enough you end up getting pretty damn close to perfect and so he goes I did it differently what' you do differently and so he he's like all right where's the local DMV he Googles it and you know Google it shows you the star ratings and like imagine a DMV's star ratings right like there's no DMV on Earth with a festar review right so it's like one and experience one Stellar yeah exactly so it's like a one and a half star experience he's like oh man he's like the reason I haven't been going I've been dreading the DMV and I love this because it's like everybody dreads a DMV so I love this he looks at that one and a half star and he goes okay but I'm a sovereign being I don't have to have a one and a half star experience that but that's the average experience I'm going to have a festar experience how do you have a five-star experience it's not by going in there and them giving you five star it's by you walking in a five-star customer so he gets in his car he drives to the DMV no appointment walks in proud happy excited opens the door for some lady you know helps this helps these people hey why don't you guys go ahead of me instead of everybody in the DMV rushing into line you guys go ahead yeah have fun and then he's the lady he was joking around with while he was walking from the parking lot in turns out she works at the DMV she sees him on the inside she's like what are you here for anyways he's like I've been driving around this expired license I've been so stressed out about it but I said today is the day she goes you're right today is the day come over here cuts the whole line gives him the thing he doesn't have to take the test gives him the license he walks out of there like you know under 30 minutes with a five-star DMV experience five and so he took that and he was like yo I just like this is like watching somebody part the seas it's like you have seen an act if you didn't believe in manif fation before if you didn't believe that you control your experience before like look what I just did with the DMV I love that story so I always held that one as like yeah you get to choose you get to choose your experience and like I also like that message of like don't expect the world to be giving you this festar Hospitality five star like you be a five star customer and watch How the Universe sort of responds to you I love that uh so I thought you would uh like like that thanks for that story dude I want to remember that one that's good I want to ask you about some things you mentioned uh Benny Blanco I got to ask you CU I'm really fascinated by these people who are the the influencers of the influencers they're the people who unlock creatives in some way or they just have this like really high hit rate what's going on what are they doing differently and we don't know the answer he was telling me he's like oh I read some [ __ ] he like you know he tries to create a safe space he kicks people out of the room he lights candles I was like okay I got to ask Mike about this what's Benny Blanco's superpower what does he do well that that has enabled him to to work with guys like you and get get kind of great results from my perspective it's it's what you did but it's the intangibles it's not the type of candle it's he really has a gift for making artists who are a Fickle Bunch right can easily get SC kind of like exotic birds you know get scared or like you know we're sensitive in a good way we pick up on things that other people don't and then we can write about and help other people to see that you know we see Divine in the mundanity but as a result is all you know we could we can feel someone's energy a lot of artists could go yo if that dude is weird like it's hard for us to write a song If there's a weird dude in the room or you know so he's a master at yeah creating the physical space but him he he knows how to get the best out of the best people in the world you have people like that in your life I'm sure whether it's family or friends that gosh you just feel comfortable around them so he's he has a gift for that and he also has great taste and his superpower one of his superpowers is is that and he's also really fun to be around you know and like I'm really driven type A when I first worked with Benny he was the first person I did a real studio session with where was in an actual recording studio you know I'd written songs with big sea in my basement but I'd never gone to a studio and I was always like man we got to work hard and at that time I'm paying by the hour for the studio we got to make the song Let's go and he was the first guy goes dude it doesn't matter if we make a song today let's just be and the song will come out and if it doesn't it'll come next time you know so he taught me how to collaborate he he taught me a lot about and hopefully I do that for other artists now too you know other people when I collaborate but yeah he he's has a gift for that I'm obsessed with these videos that are like you know some guys love the Roman Empire or whatever mine is like watching the making of these songs cuz there's so many of these on YouTube you've got a bunch of them on YouTube uh it's like you know this grainy footage and you you hear you can hear them play The Lick for the first time and they're like oh yeah I like that it's like that's the song and you almost want to reach through the screen like that's it that's the song that to love you just don't realize you just did it there's one of Benny and Ed Sheeran I think at a tour bus where he's like writing uh love yourself or something like that and they're just messing around it was the same sort of vibe where he's like sitting there cross-legged barefoot he's like yeah and it's not it didn't seem like there's a lot of stress around like what is the answer it was more just like that would be fun oh I like that you know and he was just playful with it which allowed them to play and be like you should go and [ __ ] your yeah that's great that's a great line and it's like wasn't the appropriate line but it was the like fun line and because it got there the song got there uh I'm pretty fascinated by those one of the things that I I heard that Ed said I thought was pretty interesting yeah there's some documentary about him on Apple TV plus but he goes it's almost like a Superstition he said I believe that rooms have songs rooms and instruments have songs because to write his album he wouldn't just like go to a studio he would rent a farmhouse or some like cool inspiring space and he would build a mobile Studio there which was 85% as good as the like the best studio but the house would get like double the inspiration for him or the the comfort for him in the band um I thought that was very interesting the trade-off between you know efficiency or you know picture perfect audio versus creative inspiration do you how what do you do with your environment to like get the most creative version of you very similar you know so first all I love to work in immersions like that I have a studio you know in here and you know I I mostly record myself when I'm home so my whole career same as when I was in the dorm room the mic's a little better now but I have a laptop nice mic plugged in a nice free and I hit record on the laptop I sing until I mess up I hit stop I Engineer the thing myself that way I can record whenever I want I don't need another person I have to wait for someone else to come over but I love to work in immersion similar to what you just described with Ed which is that's when the most stuff happens hey we're going to take a bunch of talented people we're going to go to a nice place that's divorced from our normal duties and we're just going to live and breed this art for a week or two weeks then we're going to basically work till we die and then we take a couple weeks off and we come back and do it again I like to work like that is that where some of your songs have come out of like a a setup like that my songs come from all over you know so that's my personal favorite way to do it but it's not about what I like it's you know the song's coming through so I I get get so I've written songs on airplanes I've written songs here I've written songs in the morning written songs at Night written songs starting with piano licks written songs starting with lyrics written songs starting with Melody so pretty much every different way hey by way we having fun I'm having fun where are we measuring up to your research dude it's higher because that's what I you gave me that iTunes U I'm better in real life that iTunes U uh story was amazing that's like you know everybody's got their favorite dish that's my favorite dish It's a combination of like the Serendipity of things working out for somebody 10 years in the making like I love that everybody everybody who's trying to do [ __ ] you want to hear stories that yeah after 10 years then it starts to work out there something we all need to hear those stories but then also you did engineer it in a way too like there you weren't a passive Observer to some lucky circumstance like you took this you took steps to like hm observation let me double down on that and you did things that there's no textbook to say make your pledges change their profile pictures and invite people but it it makes sense at the same time so I love that story thank you um I want to ask you about the the walk but also the walk or Everest or the the the uh silent meditations but I B at them all under one philosophy which is do hard things is that the right description of your philosophy why you would climb Everest why you would walk across America what's the philosophy that got that drives somebody to do those things yeah they were a lar large examples of the you know the airport day gone wrong going to volunteer saying my life is maybe too easy right now and that's why it doesn't feel right so I'm going to make a harder goal I going to make my life harder but then paradoxically my life feels easier when I'm doing the harder thing so they' they've hit on a lot of things that we touched on today and um I think that's true probably of walking across the US climbing Everest and doing some longer Meditation Retreat can you take me back to one of them where the where you were life is easy but doesn't feel quite right I don't have the same level of Joy I should be having on paper and then the decision what the voice said that made you go do one of those can you can you walk me through that yeah with the the walk across America I I was at a friend's jewelry shop and someone across the room said my friend just walked across America it was like a tractor beam I went I said what' you just say my friend walked I go you can do that said I guess you did it no one else cared about it like what's up with you man you know and I I said out loud in the in that jewelry shop I'm gonna do that one day I actually don't think I said I said I want to do that one day and the sentence lingered in the jewelry shop like a fart no one wanted to claim and everyone just sort of went back to whatever they were talking about before I said it fast forward four years later four or five years later my father dies from brain cancer and I think about six months after that um my assistant at the time Nick comes to pick me up take me to a studio session that day and he said hey man aichi is dead aichi was a friend of mine that I worked with in the music studio I worked with him a few weeks before he said aichi is dead I go don't [ __ ] with me man he said I'm not [ __ ] with you aichi is dead I said I can't I can't believe this and I get in his car he drives in his studio and I keep keep saying I can't believe this and while I'm saying I can't believe this out loud there's one thought going through my head that I can't make stop is I have to walk across America I have to walk across America I have to walk across America I have to walk across America and it was this proximity of death saying hey dude you see that man that gave you your life the one that you look just like he's dead that's what's going to happen to you you see that other man who does the same job as you you guys do the same you do concerts you're in the studio with him last week he's dead that's what's going to happen to you maybe not in the same way but this is a return trip another couple weeks past I'm in this shitty little guest house that I'm renting in West Hollywood bouncing around Studios trying to make my next hit and my friend Willie calls me he goes hey Mike I got bad news our best friends that we grew up with his name is Ronnie he goes Ronnie's dead [ __ ] man and I just realized dude I'm going to die before I die I want to live the life that I actually wanted to live and I wasn't doing it I was living the life that I thought my manager thought I should live truly I was living the life that I I was 30 years old living the life that 20-year-old me had set up and it was it was pain I walked across America cuz I was in pain and I I wanted to figure out a different way when you were doing it did you like a lot of times the reason I do something isn't the thing I get out in a great way yeah uh right I go in for one reason and I I come out with it's like going to Chuck-E-Cheese to play the games you get all these prizes at the end you didn't even realize that's that's how the tickets work um what were the prizes you got at the end of that found a part of myself that was that was so much stronger than I ever knew was even there not only found a part of myself Unleashed a part of myself that I previously didn't know was there dude I got bit by a poisonous rattlesnake I spent three nights in the ICU I got airlifted I got told by Dispatch I might not live I got told by doctors and might take me eight months to heal I got you know told by other doctors I might lose my foot this just like and I did a crazy thing dude I went back I kept going everyone expected me to quit cuz probably because the old me was such a [ __ ] you know I was like a my whole life was about me and everything me being comfortable and so like I'm going to do the opposite I'm going I'm going to be a five star Walker right do it different I'm going to do it different I'm not going to you I'm not going to use this injury as an excuse to do less I'm going use as excuse to do more and yeah I get to do podcasts and talk about it and this thing is on my wikkipedia page and the chck the real trophies that you ask is I became someone new and that part of me is it is so different having an inkling you're strong versus right knowing you're strong because you because you were strong and I was strong in a way I hadn't been before that's amazing I think that the um there's this concept of misogi have you heard of this uhuh um we've talked about in the Pod before um this guy Jesse itler came on I love Jesse iter he's a good friend man yeah so Jesse anything for Jesse Isler I like that for real uh he's one of my like I I don't ever use the word like mentors or heroes or anything but like I call him blue blueprints yeah so I look for people who live interesting lives that I'm like oh that could be I like the way that house is laid out maybe I could steal some of that blueprint he's that for me too and by the way a friend spent time with him off the off the Record yeah he's that guy yeah that's actually something I I always wonder because on the podcast you always see people's you know hopefully best he's that guy dude 24 I've been with him I watched him with his kids he's that guy so he's got he he has this idea of uh Kevin's Rule and he's got the misogi which is like misogi is like the one one Grand Challenge a year one ambitious hard thing you're going to do whether it's super physical or it might be some other thing like I I have mine which is can I go 24 hours straight without a complaint in my head um that's my that's my M it's harder for me than you know an Iron Man or anything like that that's dope dude I want to try that but that's a super power CU not in your mouth in your head dude yeah yeah anybody cannot say it but I'm saying it to myself the conversation I'm having in my head is the big one all day so good and so I'm really working on that and it's so funny you you see it you're like um and actually you're a Tony Robbins guy I'm a Tony Robbins guy too he said a phrase which made me realize how important this was uh he says he goes on some trip and he meets some guy in India or whatever and the guy goes um asked him something about suffering and he's like yeah I'm Tony Robbins like I don't know if you know this but suffering isn't what usually people describe me as like you know I'm thriving a powerful successful all these things he's always he's like didn't say that to him but that was his internal feeling was like what you mean suffering and he's like well I just saw you kind of yelling at your guy over there he's like well no he wasn't doing his job and so I had to you know immediately you know demand the performance and the guy brought to his awareness like man there are so many these little moments every day where you're losing your state this beautiful state that you're in and then it goes away and he said it like he said how cheap is your happiness like how little does it how much how little of inconvenience does it take if I spill this water on this desk right now do you lose that beautiful state or you stay in it because if you lose it then that was cheap man that was so easy to knock you out of that and I heard that and that was like o that's a it's a thing I want and I when I look at your story about like the things you wanted in your 20s the success the fame the money the the love of everybody like those are the things all of us want want at least in our 20s is often their whole lives and big part of life seems to be just figuring out what are you supposed to actually want like you know I wanted this I achieved this oh [ __ ] worst case scenario I realized I didn't even want the right thing in the first place I played a game that was rigged for me to lose so you know some of your story reminds me of that philosophy that that has served me well it's so well said and and I believe the person that Tony was talking to was Krishna G yeah and and so Krishna G and his wife PR G are these amazing te and they teach that there's only two kinds of States beautiful States and suffering States and there's all different types of suffering States and types of beautiful States joy laughter you know calm Serenity or pain depression you know self-pity you name it right but there's really only two states and so I think what all of us really want is to have more beautiful States less suffering States and so we're talking about tools to get there what do you want that's what you want I think right the problem is we convince ourselves that that we want the middleman we think the middle the promotion gives us the beautiful state achievement gives us the beautiful state anything you want you want because you think it's going to give you a better state right and maybe it will momentarily but the trick of the game is hey you don't have to wait for the thing right feel it now feel it right now and if you can if you can win that game You've Won life right right and so nobody's perfect I don't know any body you you know a lot of these guys too we just met so now you know one right right but like you we get to spend time with a lot of these teachers and gurus so I haven't met one yet that's 100% in a beautiful state but we can work more towards there and we need external goals so that's a lot of my message hey set a set a goal that actually inspires you that's Victor Frankle man search for meaning need something in the future looking forward to it's important at the same time you need to be winning this internal game of hey that's my goal but how do I want to feel as I'm going after it no that's a different kind of goal that that inner weaves with your external goal and most people forget to set that one and they lose they lose life they might win on the the vertical axis or they might win on the horizontal axis but they lose on the depth the the vertical axis so that's it man it's such a such thank you for bringing that story a great reminder and that's it that's all we're trying to do man and so any of these like tips or tools or stories or you know it's it's all to to to win that game right you know well listen man I appreciate you inviting me out to your house and appreciate you doing this thank you it's been great great it has been great peace [Music] h

all right it's it's Q4 so I don't know what whatever day you're going to hear this there's about 70 days left in the year 70 days left in year and everybody makes a big deal about January 1 New Year's resolutions but I have a different argument I have an argument that says there's 70 days left in the year just enough time to actually do the thing whatever the thing is for you that's going to make this year amazing [Music] today is a wakeup call 70 days left it's time for one Sprint on one priority to try to make it happen the one thing you could do whatever it is that's going to make your year awesome so for example maybe you're trying to get in great shape the diet starts this morning it starts now and we're going hardcore it's life or death diet mode if you're trying to if you really want to you know quit your job start the business put in your notice put in your notice today just put it in and see what happens see how it feels just the tip whatever you're going to do you got to figure out how you're going to use this 70 days Sprint if you're trying to you know hit your growth goal if you're trying to raise round of funding whatever it is this is the lock in time because 70 days is about the perfect amount of time where you could totally shift your life it's enough time to be honest about how long things take to make to make a change happen but it's short enough where you won't lolly gag and you will you're either going to make it happen this year or you're not and this last 70 days is going to be the maker break as Frank slutman the guy who who was CEO of snowflake and wrote that book amp it up he goes priority should be a single word if somebody I tells me their top three priorities all I asked them is which one is it and then they get really flustered but he goes I believe priority is a single word and so I I highly suggest figure out the one priority the one thing that if you just did this one thing the whole year is a win and use the 70 days to do it and wipe everything else off the calendar what's your uh thing going to be my one thing for this year the one thing that if I just did this thing I could look back and be like well I don't care what else happened that year that happened and that's all that matters for me it's getting in the best shape of my life and so I've made good progress I'm down about 15 pounds I would like to get turn the corner get the last 10 down by the end of this year and to do that I'll need to ratchet up and really it's not necessarily about pounds but like I set these habits I was like all right I have these habits that got me this body if I want that body I got to have these other habits and so I've been trying to change you know these four or five habits just just four or five four or five of these habits that got me where I'm where I'm at where I want to go and I've probably changed two of the four so I have the last 70 days to get the other two done what are the other two so I'll give you the two I did and I'll give you the two I need to do so the two I did uh the first one is planning planning my my the health part of my day at the beginning first thing when I wake up so uh we both I don't know if you still do but I use my body tutor so she calls me it's great right it's a great service yeah it's a great service we have no stake at least I have no stake in this business it's uh you know I'm just a big fan of it so she calls me at 8 in the morning and she says how did yesterday go what's today blah blah blah but the the thing that happens is instead of waking up and just starting my day with my work and my emails and my slack and like me little computer stuff no I start my day with the top priority the thing I really care about which is rewiring these habits and in doing so I basically stop improvising because the improvising is where I'm just going to make whatever decision happened in the moment and that those decisions are the the key thing right so by planning my day I say all right I'm gonna eat this this and this at these times I'm going to work out here and most importantly we identify like what might trip me up it's like oh I have to take my kids to the gymnastics thing that's like an hour away at the time I normally eat dinner so you plan around the grenade yeah it's like oh so what are you going to do oh simple I'll just bring it with me in the car or I'll uh I'm going to eat before I go or you'll look ahead like like three days you're like all right on Saturday I've got a birthday party I know we're gonna have cake I'm GNA splurge on that one piece of cake which means leading up to it I gotta I gotta prepare that I'm gonna like I gotta be tight today so a big part of it was realizing the decision tank the gas tank of decisions of good decisions is full in the mornings and by the evening it's depleted and so all my bad decisions happen then and so I just make all the decisions up front for what I'm going to do and then I simply just need to to stick to them which of course not perfect like the daily one so basically they call you daily and the reason why that's good is that's when you're like really getting after it and then the weekly one is like I use her as like I'm happy where I am uh they should call it the serious person plan and then the unserious person plan like are you serious about this or are you not so serious if you're not so serious here do this weekly plan and then what's the fourth so first habit plan the plan the plan all the meals and the workouts up front first thing in the morning make the decision then don't make the decisions as you go make one decision at the beginning the second one is what I call the the four-point swing so if you've ever played basketball you know there's a this thing that the announcers will say where let's say you had an open shot you should have made it you would have scored two points but instead you fumble the ball the other team takes it and they get an easy shot and so it was a four-point swing it should have been two you know you should have been up two and they should have had zero instead you missed your to and they got to right so four-point swing so I realized oh there's one part of my day that's like the four-point swing it's like it could have gone in my favor and instead it totally wipes me out which is like basically for me it's I work pretty late so after my kids go to bed then I have kind of like this relaxation and I'll do like more work so I usually stay up pretty late if I late night snack there and I so basically it's like I'm up late so I sleep I sleep late and therefore I also because I'm up late I eat late and then I dude I started going to bed early just to avoid that situation exactly it's like yo I can't I I don't know if I have the willpower to not late night snack but I could just go upstairs and go to bed and that's kind of the only thing and then in the morning of I'm hungry great I make good decisions again the tank is full so anyways that that that those are the two that I've I've been working on and made a lot of progress on and then I have two more which is treat the weekends like the weekdays because my weekends I was just become a different person it was [ __ ] Marty Gro for me it was like wait wait well why why did I throw away all those habits that I do during the week that are great and just treat the weekends totally differently so that's silly not going to do that anymore um and then I have one more which is my so my my my sort of like thing that gets me is chips it's like you sort of like a snack so it's kind of the root why it's like well it's basically the cheapest way to pleasure it's like super fast it's right in front of me it's the fastest way to pleasure so substituting that with another thing that's a fast cheap way to get pleasure right so it's like uh other things I like to do or other things that feel good in the moment that's not like some delayed gratification uh instant gratification just not through a snack but through whatever like you know take a shower there's like this other like uh sparkling water drink that I make whatever little other things that I could substitute so doing those substitutes the weekday and weekend thing is pretty funny Once time know Kagan he's one of my best friends and he was like years ago he goes you're the only person I know who doesn't drink but you're still fat what the hell I had a friend that said the same he goes I saw my company he goes okay cool you're rich now I'm like yeah thanks uh and he goes there's no uh you can't be rich and fat he's like there's no excuse if you're poor you just don't have the time you can't get the nutritious food and you can't get the gym like okay understandable you're rich in fat that's you that's all you uh so he was like you can't be rich and fat it's just a rule I was like oh okay felt like I got into some club and they were like you need to take your shoes off at the door it's so funny um by the way one thing to finish that that food thing remember when Brian Johnson came on the first time on this podcast like before Brian Johnson became like um way more famous and like you know uh changed his entire look so like kind of the before photo Brian Johnson basically when he came on he said something he goes oh yeah we fired evening Brian and I thought that was just such a good way of saying it he's like yeah we had a meeting of the Brian morning Brian was there work Brian was there and evening Brian was there we just decided evening Brian you're [ __ ] it up for the rest of us so you're fired you no longer get to make decisions um we've take that power away from you I thought that was a great way of saying it uh he he did a really good job of have you read that book 48 Laws of Power like one of the laws of power is like change your identity occasionally and like occasionally is that how it says they're like like they're like it's a tool it's like a tool so for example the author he was like uh Lady Gaga like if you look at like early photos of her she was like a very normal girl but she always had like a little weird quirky side to her but he's like she went all in on it and just changed her identity overnight to to be like this kind of like strange person and then nowadays by the way if you see Lady Gaga she's not actually that weird anymore you remember that era where she like would wear meat as a dress now she like has an album with like Tony Bennett like a very classic singer and she's like more of a like a you know whatever she that would be called like classic Beauty versus before she was like artistic pomp when bitcoin price is up and pomp when bitcoin price is down there two pomps The Tale of Two And I think Brian Johnson changed his identity and I thought that that was like a really Savvy thing to do I thought it was great and I think I I take inspiration from it hey let's take a quick break to talk about AI we all know AI big deal um you see demos all the time of people doing really cool things but as a business owner sometimes it's hard to figure out how do I actually use this what do I actually do I've been trying to use it across all my businesses you know things like making little prototype websites without needing to hire a coder or writing copy for our website or I give it a bunch of data and I ask it to analyze it for me it's been kind of amazing but the thing I always need is inspiration I know the tool can do a lot but it can almost do so much that I'm not really sure what I should actually be doing with it and so that's why I think it's great that HubSpot has created a report where they surveyed 2,000 Global Marketing leaders and ask them you what's separating the high growth and low growth businesses and what strategies they're using with AI in their business you can grab these strategies and apply them to your own business for free the link is in the description below can I tell you a story that I've been kind of thinking about constantly okay all right so I have to tell you the story about this guy named uh Jamie Beaton So Jamie is a 29-year-old from New Zealand he was raised in uh a single household in New Zealand but he's kind of like grown to be probably like the best college kid on earth so listen to The Story So this guy Jamie he's raised by single mother in New Zealand and I guess if I had to like psycho analyze him he probably like has some like rejection type of like you know he's not good enough type of vibe that a lot of great great people who achieve greatness have and he gets obsessed with school but particularly with University applications and how to get into like the best university on Earth and so he sets out with a goal to become the most qualified high school student in all of New Zealand and he like creates this really in-depth strategy it's like you know he's got to be unique so he goes and starts two different businesses one being like a newspaper delivery business one another being like an iPhone repair business he focuses on being the best and so he like strategically picks activities that he can excel in then he looks to maximize validation meaning like whatever he's good at he wants to like enter into a contest and like win and then really good academic so he's like gets straight AIDS and so he like does this like crazy curriculum that he creates for himself and by the age of 17 he's accepted into 25 universities so he's accepted into Harvard Yale princ and Sanford Columbia Cambridge Duke and a bunch of other stuff but he ends up going to Harvard but before he gets into Harvard like word spreads in New Zealand that this kid is like a Wonder kid and like he's like the greatest thing on earth and so he even like host like a 230 person talk in New Zealand where all these parents are like Jamie tell us how you did this like this is so amazing so fast forward to today he's 29 years old he's got seven degrees and one PhD he has a like if you go to his LinkedIn it literally looks like a fake LinkedIn listen to his education so a bachelor's in applied math from Harvard a master's in applied math from Harvard a PhD in public policy from Oxford two masters from Stanford a master's in entrepreneurship from Penn a masters from Princeton a law degree from Yale and a master m in global affairs from a university in China is that [Laughter] insane show 12 educations I've never seen that it looks fake so now while this kid he's he's 29 now but while he was a kid sophomore in college he was like this is kind of interesting what's going on and so he creates a college tutoring business which is like kind of like a stereotypical not stereotypical but it's like a common story of people who like Master the game they like start these tutoring businesses but it actually starts working to the point where by the he's a sophomore in college it does a million in revenue and obviously he's interning because that's what great college kids do but he's interning at Tiger management which is like you know one of the most prestigious like hedge funds in the world and his boss is like dude this is pretty cool you should like go in on go all in on this and so he turns his little side business I mean it was a million in Revenue by the time he was sophomore wasn't that wasn't that much of a side business but he turns it into a real business and it's called Crimson education and that's like what the story in the Wall Street Journal was about so Crimson education does something like 120 to 150 million in Revenue it's valued around $500 million they have something like a thousand employees and it's like the greatest way I guess to get into a highly touted University for your kids and so these these parents are spending crazy amounts of money something like $200,000 a year for a handful of the product offerings that they have in order to get their kid into an Ivy League school and it starts way before high school we're talking like fifth sixth grade you're smiling is this ridiculous or what so I'm sing for a couple reasons first the headline is great so it says the guru who says he can get your 11-year-old into Harvard and there's a picture of him shaking this Asian kid's hand which is just hilarious hilarious first why an 11-year-old into harv all right that's that's funny thing one two love the name Crimson education as you know right big fan of when you hijack The Prestige of another thing in a way that's totally legal the way that you did with Hampton the way he's doing with the crimson color for Harvard Crimson education great name when I Google the name the very first thing it says and by the way this article came out six days ago the very first thing in the Google headline is Crimson education As Seen On The Wall Street Journal like this guy is a [ __ ] Prestige hacker he immediately was like now it's goingon to be like as featured on my first million right like he's just G to keep grabbing badges from schools from press from whoever he can get so so I think that's uh hilarious the next thing the next uh thing that I find a little bit funny is the premise of this is I will help your kid get into a top university is that right but it's not test prep no so they they have first of all if you go to are you on their website they're offering or like their headline is amazing 98% acceptance acceptance rate to your top college choice so listen to like the product so the the product is like pretty ridiculous basically like you remember how like outlined it into like stick out you know like be unique whatever like he has like these the Crimson education has these like tenants of what you need so it's like uh get amazing grades so he's like B's are bombs you basically have to have like perfect A's uh then he's like you need to have strong leadership and so what Crimson does is they definitely tutor people so I think they have 50,000 students who get tutoring but dude they encourage you to do all types of crazy [ __ ] so they encourage you to start a business podcast or or or rather start a business or start a podcast or go and publish an academic paper and so they have services that help their students get PR or help their students go and publish research and so there one example of a kid who started a a a podcast and it got so popular that universities started asking to be featured on the podcast and so that's an example of like things where they try to tell you that you have to have strong leadership they also say that you have to have a unique profile and so what he says is or what Crimson does is they help students find like 10 activities that they're interested in and then helps them be the the best at the activities and cut the fat and not be not participate in things that they're not going to be like the best at it's like pretty ridiculous so they offer tutoring but they also offer like for something like $200,000 they do like really Hands-On like we need you to do this this this and this over the course of a handful of years to increase the likelihood and it by the way it works like there's debate over how much it works like there's debate where they're like you know these kids are like Rich smart kids anyway like their parents are going to like force them to get into all the [ __ ] anyway like did this actually help but something like 2% of the students admitted into Brown Columbia Harvard and Penn last year were his clients and it says uh like this many people get in as verified by big four accounting service like he's like doubting that they they've been audited on their claims of of this this is pretty wild dude because he's like brag he was bragging to the Wall Street Journal reporter like crazy or not bragging they were asking him questions and he was like yeah like we had uh 24 marnel dude but listen what he says he goes the acceptance letters were certified by Price waterhous Cooper and a list of students admitted so like he he he sent Walsh she journal the thing and it had like the price water Cooper's like seal of like yeah it's legit I hate this um just goingon to say that out loud I hate this um but I respect this why do you hate it for one I mean the respect is easy like it's easy dog it's the same reason I hate the Olympics and I respect people I respect Olympians meaning this guy is doing the thing the thing I said was stupid about the Olympics where somebody dedicates 2020 22 years of their life to becoming the best you know L the Lou Pusher in the world and it's like bro like if you had this much talent why didn't you just apply it to something that's useful dude what else could you if you're a ler what you just got a big ass and you can like push heavy [ __ ] like what else you gon to do the L is built for you you lay down well could have been a famous you know person in a rap video could many many options only you better options on the table um no but seriously like the sort of like game embracing the system so much that you try to game the system for this arbitrary University application thing it just it's like dialed up to level 20 there's something off-putting about that to me I don't know I guess like I just don't like I think most college educations and as I wear a Duke sweatshirt uh most uh Ivy Leagues and the admission process I think it's all pretty bogus and I don't think it has a very high correlation to like it's the wrong game right what what is the phrase play stupid games Win stupid prizes I think this is playing stupid games to win a stupid prize however I get it and I respect that this guy has prayed on the fears and the hopes and the dreams of these tiger parents to be like hey give me $200,000 I'll make sure your kid has a gets the right logo on their here I hear you and a lot of me agrees with you but let me just make the argument against you first of all the in your group of people the Indians in part have thrived in America because of the emphasis on not just on education but like being the best so like there's definitely power to it but you also went to Duke I didn't go to Duke my wife went to an IB League school so I hang out with a lot of these like smart people like you and her and that type of education it's on one hand it's sort of like a rich person telling you rich it doesn't make you happy to be rich and you're like yeah let me let me figure it out on my own like let me get there and I'll decide yeah but the second thing is I actually think that there's huge amounts of tangible benefits the education that's normal what is Will from Goodwill Hunting say like just I can get that for like 15 bucks in late fees from a library to learn the same [ __ ] as you but uh like your network partially because mostly because San Francisco to be honest but a lot of it because of Duke and Sarah's Network because of pen like it was so much more Global than mine was at a small Rinky Dink school in Nashville Tennessee like you guys thought so much bigger the people who you with were so much more Global they were so much more prestigious and and and in a good way and so I actually think that playing the game to go to a top 20 University is probably worth it to play the game to win to play the game and not go to one of these amazing schools I actually don't think it's worth it yeah I'm not saying necessarily that going to top school is not worth it I guess what I'm saying is the amount of energy and sort of the manufactured nature of this it's sort of like the way that PR it's like it's I guess it's good to be featured but like PR is sort of this the process to get a bunch of PR press is often a very sticky process and yeah you're hating the game yeah exactly I hate the game um and I think that in this case like dedicating your life to manufacturing this perfect resume that's optimized for the Harvard admission system just doesn't seem like the good like the right use of talent and time and so you know that same person if they actually just did what they were interested in and um you know like followed their actual Curiosities and passion I think that's just again know better better way to live but you know get off my high horse now let me just let me get a stool so I can get down did you did you see a photo of this guy he looks like uh exactly like I want him to look like he looks like a student still at 29 like he looks uh he looks smart I guess he looks ivy league um did you have a College admission like counselor or anything like that uh yeah like our high school had a college counselor who I went in and they go okay so where do you want to go to school I said I want to go to Duke and they go you should lower your expectations and I was like wow that's the opposite of what I think somebody's supposed to say in your job like aren't I supposed to dream big what's going on here and uh he's like yeah it's pretty tough out there so you know what else we got on the list let's go down lower on the list and see what we could do because my grades weren't the best and he rubbed it in his face did you um but did you have like a tutor uh no but I did take like you know GM or what not GM like the Kaplan like test prep like I studied for the SATs that was what I did I did not have any of that stuff but when I was reading this article they said roughly 25% did you take the SATs no I did the ACT okay so you took the acts did you do a test prep thing no I took it one time my junior year I think or maybe I took it twice my junior year and I got a combined score I think of 28 which is like combined score with like both tests both I think doesn't it maybe I'm wrong but I thought they take like math and verbal or whatever yeah like they you get like the best of each try and they like combine it I think I got a 27 or 28 which is like 85 percentile I think did you do well on it I did good on it I was good I was a good test taker I wasn't good in school like the consistency of everyday you you know me I'm not good with the everyday stuff but if it was like it's time to do the big the big performance I could do that part well that's what did you get on the SAT you have to brag about it then if you did good I think I got the equivalent of like a CU they had changed the scoring system to like the 2400 or whatever but I got the equivalent of what now is like like a 1500 basically what I don't know SAT but let me look it up it goes up to 16 1600's perfect 1500's like excellent and like you know 1300 plus dude it says that's in the 98th percentile yeah yeah it was a really good score it's like you missed like a couple questions basically did you try yeah yeah I tried I took I basically for like 60 days before the test I just took two two practice test a day and this s is like a six- hour test so I took a six hour test in the morning I took a break I ate whatever and then I took took another six- hour test or a 5 hour test whatever it was in the evening and I just did that every day for like 30 days during the summer and then I took the then I took the SATs well you should have went and started one of these like companies on how to like master that [ __ ] because I didn't realize how big that these I didn't realize how big this was they said that um like 25% of people going to Harvard this year they had one of these like tutors and then it goes up even higher that if your parents if your parents have a household income of at least half a million dollars half of them use uh these types of tutors and man yeah I didn't realize how much of a game or how you could gain this so like you could you could really kick ass at it uh if you just like well if you have Rich parents for one and two if you just like hire coaches I didn't I didn't buy into that but now I do so you're gonna do this type of stuff I think that if my children show an academic like if they're if they're good at academics then yeah I would encourage them to do this if they're only mildly decent at academics I would say like let's consider different Alternatives I think I dude I'm like kind of at I think that like these fancy schools like what you went to should be like designed for like the for like the academic class and like the rest of us like plees like I I think I should have gone to like a trade school or or or or or a state school I think I should have gone to like a like a like a $15,000 year university Missouri and like explored versus going into debt of 150 Grand to go to like a a a non-top university I think that's ridiculous yeah I think that's right all right I have one and you have a few which one you want to do let's do a quick one on this kfish thing I don't know how much I have to say it just kind of fascinated me so let's see if there's something interesting here so I was at a breakfast and somebody was talking to me about a business idea that they were doing or that they had done in the past I was like man that sounds like a good idea where'd you get that idea from and he goes oh it's the Fisher Investments model what's Fisher Investments and he goes oh you don't know Ken fiser he's like you got to look this guy up so I go down this Rabb hole who is Ken fiser so basically he's a billionaire money manager so he's my bil of the Week Big Time billionaire like like 15 billion yeah exactly and he basically uh created a a simple firm so it's a um an investment adviser money manager type of firm uh called Fisher Investments and he grew it over the years to where they now manage you know upwards of$ 275 million do uh billion dollars assets under management so 275 billion with a B they got 3,500 employees they uh the and they ended up selling to private Equity so they sold to Advent they sold not the full amount but they sold at a 122.5 billion valuation and that was the first outside Capital Race So this guy basically bootstrapped his way to a 12 billion company and the question is how did he do it what did he do and so this guy's story in in the I guess the simple terms is his dad was a finance guy he actually wrote a book that was kind of popular called Common Stocks and uncommon profits which by the way when I went to money P's house he I asked him to recommend you know four or five books off his wall and that might have been one of them I remember seeing it in his uh in his library and Warren Buffett called that book a major influence on his career so that was his dad what he did was he left he went out and he started his own firm and the key is this guy's basically a marketing master so what he did was instead of trying to I shouldn't say instead of but like most people who are great with Investments or money management there's a certain profile of a person and that person typically doesn't have incredible direct response advertising skills by the way it's typically the opposite a lot of the people who are in this industry are the opposite of extroverted and they kind of like want to be in a hole and just not talk to anyone and they don't advertise at all and it's uh so when when they did this deal some of the numbers came out and basically these guys are spending $60 million a year on marketing which sounded like a ton to anybody else in the money management space and to him he was like that's nothing that he goes I get the question why do you advertise so much he goes because we have no market share they go you have over hundred billion dollars in assets on management he goes that is nothing have you seen the size of this Market we're just the biggest grain of sand in the sandbox but we're still just a grain of sand we have 0.1% if that and so he said we spend about six% of our revenue on marketing so that's still not a lot they spend you know 60 million a year and so they're doing about a billion dollars a year in revenue and um he basically created this system of this Marketing System and so you can go watch his ads and I went and watch a bunch of his TV ads and what he says is like he's like well there's we we broke it down so he's like there's six mental profiles of people how they think of their retirement and their savings and investing and so they break out the six psychographic profiles you have you know let's say the the grandma who just doesn't want to lose it all you have the um the guy who's stashed away and his 401k and he's looking for he thinks he he feels like he should be doing more but he doesn't know exactly what and he's pretty distrustful with most people with you know people who come to him and so they have these profiles and then they started running ads they do focus groups they try to figure out which ads are working and there's little nuggets along the way that they were like why do you use they were like why do you use your face in the ads uh you know do you feel like there's some risk with that or would it make it harder to sell the business he goes because we found that clients want to the clients want to believe that there's someone who wakes up in the morning and gives a darn that there's a person not an institution who cares that's why we use my image because here's Ken he's 68 years old he gets up in the morning and he cares that's what I need to convince you of and then he talked about how um they're like you know what did you learn from your you know your advertising because they're very scientific about it he's like well one thing for example we learned that men's faces do better than women's everybody told us we should be using female faces that's going to appeal more not in our testing our testing shows that men's faces are going to convert better than than female faces K there's a famous ad where it's an outline um you know how the Wall Street Journal has photos of their authors that are like dots it's like a it's like a sketch actually it's a it's a sketch out of dots yeah whatever he buys out brain ads and tabula ads and they would always see a dotted profile photo where you think it looks like a Wall Street Journal article and then you click and it goes to Fisher Investments right and so that's how I first learned about them because I'm like these guys Fisher Investments they're following me everywhere on the internet well so if you click one of those they're great with headlines so for example you click One of Those outbrain ads those tabula ads you're going to go to a page it's just a video there's no navigation there's no nothing and the V video is called uh debunkery seeing through wall Street's money killing myths and it's a 12-minute video that you're gonna see where he debunks you know wall Street's wall Wall Street myths and you know this type of like BuzzFeed headline stuff isn't what you're going to find from most money managers most money managers would cringe at that they don't know that they don't know how to do those they don't have the team in place like you've talked about Agora for example he's basically agor fied you know money management by putting out really compelling juicy content and then advertising it everywhere so they spend a ton of money on ads they're on Fox News they're on Forbes or on Wall Street Journal they're on market watch um you know they're basically they have this profile they're like we're looking for somebody who's got a $500,000 retirement portfolio they don't want to getrich Quick ad and then you look at their ads and it'll say want to retire comfortably if you have $500,000 download this guide by Forbes column as a money manager Ken fiser firm it's called the definitive guide to to retirement income and then there's a picture of a guy on Horseback like like a dude who's like ready to retire and like get out of the office and be on Horseback or he'll have an ad like I have one here on I'll put these up on YouTube so you can see the ads but like his out braing ad says what does your net worth say about when say about how you'll retire so it's kind of like a personality quiz like what does your net worth say about how your retirement is going to go and it's a picture of a man and a woman on a boat like Titanic dude this is so good I'm looking at it now just like I want to show you this um here just I'm going to screen share this real quick it works by the way because I I have to assume that his um product is good right like I don't know we'll see I don't have a strong opinion on that look at this landing page though designed for conversion he's got the 15minute retirement plan as a book and it's an arrow and there's a drag and drop like box it's like where should you get it get it right here get my free quote right and then you got Ken fiser below here's a here's a white guy you could trust and I just thought this guy's marketing is uh just excellent I think it's to be studied I think it's extremely effective especially with the crowd that he's going for which is kind of like the 50 and up crowd um so studying this guy's ad library was was pretty pretty insightful and it also just brought up a an interesting idea which is a lot of people when they're great at marketing they go into spaces that them and their friends are already in which is often like d Toc e-commerce or uh marketing agencies like you are being a you're trying to be a great marketer in a sea of great marketers I think what the genius of this guy is is he said how do I be you know just you know two notches above average at marketing but go into a space where nobody knows anything about marketing right or everybody is like doing a very rudimentary Playbook and so that's where I think the opportunity is like if you go do this in the senior living space it's like the people who own and operate Senior Living businesses are not the same sharks that you're going to get trying to sell you know uh handbags on the internet because those people the people who sell handbags on the internet they're worth class marketers that's why they're able to sell you know a handbag for you know 10x the cogs and the other thing is that when people see these ads they think does this work I can't believe this works first of all yes it works it does it works for everyone it's not just like old like you kind of made a comment like only older people are into this I think this always works this type of stuff works really well regardless of the age uh but when like a brand advertising goo who lives in Brooklyn New York who wears common project shoes they see this type of [ __ ] and they think this is [ __ ] lame I should make my website look flashier when in reality a plain white website that has just long form copy of like 3,000 words can oftentimes more often than not convert better than a flashy website so let me read you the last few notes I have here so he's been a Forbes columnist for like 20 plus years so he he was like he's basically content marketing right like what what we do and what we get a lot of credit for which is like well you build an audience you bu build a brand and that helps you with distribution this guy has been doing that for 30 plus years he wrote several books so he wrote superstocks and other ones he has an army of salespeople that cold call investors and they call they talk about this basement this basement of like cold callers that are just sitting there and and people report that like dude I I I signed up for this free guide once I read it and then they've just been badgering me for like years ever since and they keep calling me trying to get me to invest with them he says that everybody else uh relies on referrals from other partners they don't think about the broader world how do we get people calling us that was their goal and they have an estimated about $114,000 CAC so it cost them $144,000 to acquire a customer they spent uh you know just over $60 million on ads back in 2019 they're the 12th biggest spender on Financial Services they have like you know 60 plus thousand individual investors plus then they manage another 1010 billion plus from pensions state governments municipes Etc they charge about you know 1% uh one 1.25% in fees so you know you could do the math on 1.25% of 250 billion um and then it's hard to gauge the performance they don't have publicly available numbers for everything but they the p in the past Fisher funds with publicly available numbers have under underperformed the market substantially so they have a purisma total return fund it was a mutual fund that had 25% return in 10 years the S&P 500 Index would have been a th% in the same time uh yet still if it this so the quote was if his firm is not the biggest raia it's close and so to build the biggest investment advisor firm while not necessarily having the best returns and you know but being the best marketer is the story here dude [ __ ] podcasts I want to do that this sounds awesome right of course there's a billion reasons why like it's a pain in the ass to run just like everything else is but that sounds great dude I've been watching better call Sal have you watch this show what and what do you want to become like an ambulance Chaser isn't he just a lawyer no but well yeah he's a lawyer but like one of the things they show him doing is like him making his commercials and his ads to try to be you know to be like better call all and uh it reminded me so much of this Ken Fisher Playbook and the show makes it seem the show makes also the hustle he does to like create these commercials is also very fun he's nailed The Branding this is cool I've seen his ads all over the place and I knew he was big I didn't know they got acquired so I wasn't able to ever see any of the numbers but that's amazing well look look at here's some of the I think this is his own reporting of his performance 2007 he says if you bought oh this is not their funds this is like his recommendations but if you bought all of my all 60 of my recommendations you would be up 0.9% and um assuming you lost 1% transaction fees the S&P 500 is down .5% okay so nothing big 2008 he says how are my results last year in line with the market which is to say not good 2009 that's what he said yeah 2009 I made 65 recommendations if you put an equal summon each you'd be up 44% stock markets up up 29 20.9% uh 2010 he says your return is 18% versus 12% uh but these are like his stock picks I think from his Forbes column which is not the same that's like his entertainment not same if you have an in an a wealth advisor or whatever this this stuff's called if you have a an adviser who promises to make you more than the index they're lying but but then what is the point of the adviser the the point is is that um like as you grow and get older um it's Savvy to think all right I need to get less stocks more bonds um and those mature sometimes 6 12 24 months so it's like the buying of those if setting up an estate plan there's a bunch of administrative stuff that often but not always that 1% can kind of pay for itself or like help you you could also say that they are kind of like a therapist so when you want to sell stuff they're like dude don't sell it don't be an idiot but there's a bunch of administrative stuff but outperforming the market is is not the main value and and if if you have an adviser who says that they're going to outpick then they're foolish by the way do you know who who else does this is mle fool so the mle fool they have a a a fund that has well over a billion dollars uh and it started as a stock picking newsletter and now theyve branched out to having a fund and so they actually have a wealth advisory business that is massive and it was built up the exact same way as Ken Fischer yeah it's pretty crazy they youed had a billion dollars this guy's over 250 billion so somehow mly fool which is like also excellent online content it probably has way more traffic does not have anywhere near the same assets under management which I think is always interesting to look at you know when two people pursue the same strategy and one gets a 100x return uh you know sometimes you point to luck or timing or other things but often it's um you know it's a business model Choice it's a strategic choice or it's an executional uh Point that's different yeah this is insane Molly FL is 1.5 billion um can I tell you a quick story about um related to something that eled Gil said yeah so he made a comment where we asked him like what he's interested in and he said monuments and so what he meant was like uh an example of a monument is the Statue of Liberty or in some ways like the Eiffel Tower like things that like exist mostly to bring Pride to a country but then also act as like a tourist destination and he was saying you know why don't we build more of these what happened to The Monuments was sort of the question yeah he was like look when we were up and coming like we loved building monuments and like they it gave a sense of Pride and it was like good for like it was like very pro-america and it got people bought in and I had a guy listen to the podcast and he sent me the deck that he's trying to raise money for a monument that's based in San Francisco on Alcatraz and so you have to see this so it's a picture of first of all I don't know who this uh I've never heard of this person but you know who Prometheus is he's like a Greek god and it's basically like he represents the spe of Innovation and courage for the purpose of building for manifest destiny for inborn nobility which elevates Humanity they want to build a massive statue of him that's 350 feet tall and it's on uh the where Alcatraz is and for the Statue of Liberty had like a hot boyfriend this would be him yes and that's exactly what it is on the other side of the country he's just holding up a torch just like she is except for he's absolutely ripped and he's from the movie 300 and he's got like a speedo on um it's basically spe to be honest so like they did not pull any punches as far as the the amount of stone and steel that's going into this guy and so first of all I've got to say the obvious that there will never be a satue that touts Manifest Destiny and inborn nobility and the Spirit of Courage that's going to sit in the Bay of San Francisco that the like all the like and a shirtless rip dude none of that I think will ever happen but the idea is actually interesting and so what they want to do is they want to they're raising $100 million to build this statue on alcatra and so it's 350 feet and um but in their deck they talk about uh the money uh or the revenue and profit of other people of other statues so listen to this [ __ ] so the Statue of Liberty uh does $154 million a year in Revenue $70 million a year of net income and then you can go down to like Pearl Harbor really yeah I mean hold on where is okay so Statue of Liberty that do say that again that's that's mind-blowing so Statue of Liberty you said $70 million of net income $150 million of Revenue so 50% you know net profit margins on four and a half million visitors each one paying 25 bucks a ticket and $10 of concessions it's insane it's it's insane and then it goes down to like Mount Rushmore which is on the smaller end which does 50 million in sales and 20 million a year in net income or Pearl Harbor same thing 50 million 23 million uh dude I was laughing why are we not doing this these are amazing businesses that's my point and so I went and I saw these numbers and I'm like that's absolutely ridic ridiculous and it's like amazingly good and of course with all things related to like investment decks you know that you paint the best possible story and who knows if any of it actually no Source sided on this there's no Source I looked up some of the stats and like the Statue of Liberty numbers it does it kind of checks out where that it is plausible that those are the numbers but they're raising $170 million to build this and their goal is to make aund million dollar a year in profit or like that's what they say the numbers are and so you start doing the math and like I said this is all just some guy drawing this up and like who knows uh it's the this is painting the best story ever uh of a of a thing that doesn't exist but the math is somewhat interesting behind like the like how this all works and so you're saying there's a chance yeah so they're like we do this we're going to do $94 million a year net income and so it's actually pretty interesting that like monu of course dude you're not going to like be able to build this in San Francisco they're not gonna have any part of it how much have they raised so far do you know no in like when I was Googling it they have like a substack and they say things like Joe Lonsdale is on board and like all these like uh amazing people are on board and they have a substack documenting uh what they're talking about but they I don't think I saw that they said how much they've raised I think it's cool the people doing this I guess I have a few thoughts I think it's cool that people are doing this I hope something like this happens I am stunned at the profitability of these other monuments that is that is my Golden Nugget for the Pod that that is amazing noted okay noted there's there's something here this deck by the way does not look wellmade and I think if you're G to try to pull something like this off you have to Al like if you can't pay for a designer for your deck then I'm not sure I believe that you're going to do this yeah yeah it and like this is I wonder how like like when they're going to bed at night talking to their wives I wonder if they're like saying like isn't this hilarious that we're trying this or is it like when this thing build got you got you gotta fully believe that you're doing God's work out here yeah and it could happen but so it's called if you want to look it up I've got no affiliate I've never talked to these people it's called the American Colossus Foundation kind of funny yeah yeah I think you're right though that location really matters like you have to go somewhere that both has you know can be a tourist destination but has uh you need the approvals right you can't just get stuck in limbo and San Francisco Bay area is probably one of the harder places to get get approval for something like this dude San Francisco is the antithesis of a ripped like a ripped like Alpha looking heterosexual male like this is like not like they I lived in San Francisco for 10 years this is not exactly what the culture uh is about so I think you remember the art we had on the wall the giant painting we had on the wall in my office at Monkey Inferno where it was the reverse of the evolution of man you know evolution of man is like it's a ape and then he's like standing half upright then he's fully upright then he's walking and then it's like you know that's the homo sapien today and the thing we had on the wall was the Homo Sapien and then it's him bending over looking at his phone bending over sitting basically sitting down at a laptop and then typing and it was like a coder at the end of it and it was like that was the final evolution the opposite that was that's what should be the monument in San Francisco yeah like a giant neck beard yeah wearing a hoodie it not not a not a jacked Greek god yeah um you want to do one more thing yeah I got a few uh quick hitters okay let's do uh let's do this one so talking to Bankers I think this is a good value ad this is a pro tip life Pro tip for for any Founders out there I didn't know this when I first started doing startups I had no idea and only the first time I ever came into contact with a banker was when I tried to sell my company so I was kind of like I don't know eight or nine years into doing entrepreneurship and even then I didn't know what a banker was somebody said I'll introduce you to a banker and I thought that's the guy at Wells Fargo that like sits in the back not in the front like I didn't I didn't really understand what that meant turns out a banker is like an investment banker there's somebody who can help you sell your company raise Capital get debt that sort of thing and they they come in at a certain level scale so usually something like $30 million and up really they try to be like kind of like a$1 million company or so and I had a friend who was uh you know successful entrepreneur and he told me something that that really stuck with me he goes I was like oh when do you think you should talk to these guys like you know and I was thinking meaning like when you're ready yeah like when I'm ready like at the very beginning of when I'm ready or do I need to have all my stuff together and he goes he goes the best thing I ever did was I talked to a banker a year before I wanted to sell my business and I talked to them and I go a year before what do you mean and he goes yeah because I went to the banker and I saidif I wanted to sell my business today what would it be worth uh would it be able to sell how strong would would this asset look like in the marketplace right now and they know all the deals that have gotten done so Bankers are in the process the bankers are in the middle of selling companies just like yours in your industry so you go to a banker that's in the industry they've seen everything that's traded they know the relative strength they know the valuations that they're trading at they know who the buyers are they know why that they're buying and so they can give you a really clear picture and he goes I went before I was ready because I wanted them to tell me what would cause this to not sell what would be the weak points of this business so that became my road map for the next year of what I needed to fix that became my priority list so that when I did go to market I actually had those things fixed and if I hadn't gotten that feedback at that point I would have just got that same feedback a year later and it would have punted the C way down the road they're gonna they're going to tell you that [ __ ] regardless and so it's nice to know early and so I think Bankers are actually pretty big cheat code not just for selling your so that was the first thing I I learned second thing was you could actually talk to Bakers before you even go into a space and I think you've done this before too which is you go to a banker who's in a space that you're interested in and you talk to them about the companies that have sold and you're like what what companies have sold how were they doing what what was their you know strengths and weaknesses why did who are the buyers why did they buy the question is basically what's the profile and attributes of a business in this space that out kicks the rest of you know that that performs better than the other ones so tell me all those attributes and those uh those strengths and weaknesses and I'm gonna just do that or exactly you can reverse engineer meaning you can work backwards from that and find a great business so I did this with a recent business we haven't announced yet where we we first talked to bankers and we we learned from that oh that validated a lot of things we already liked about the business idea we had an idea talked to the bankers that kind of co-signed or stamped that yes this is actually an even better idea than we thought meaning it traded for much higher multiples and the business could be like we didn't we didn't have to do a B and C A and B were going to be more than enough to have an outstanding outcome they also told us the on the other hand like so for example here's my five questions for Bankers I go to bankers and I say what deals have gotten done recently so that's the first question number two which ones like you said outkick the coverage so which ones traded at the highest multiple and why what was unique about those was it just simply timing or was there something that they had in their the way that they did it or their cost structure that made them particularly attractive then the third question I ask is what deals didn't get done and why so meaning what deals couldn't cross the finish line what were the big red flags that stopped people from buying the business because you want to basically know those too fourth question who are the B who are the buyers and why are they buying so basically every buyer has a plan and you want to know are the buyers only strategics or are there private Equity folks are there independent sponsors who are the potential buyers and then what's their game plan once they buy it oh they're buying things at a five $5 million eida number for X or 10x and then they are going to they're they're rolling up five of those and they're trying to get to 25 million and they're trying to trade that at 20x and okay that's their game plan gotcha and what do they you know and then the last one is if my business did XYZ so this is the useful one when you're not ready yet but I basically say hey here's where we're at today here's where I think we're going to be in a year if this is what my business looked like a year from now what do you think it would trade for and why and getting that from four or five different Bankers really helps triangulate a space I so I did last week I spent maybe seven hours on the phone with Bankers doing this process and I feel like I learned more in those seven hours than I you know would have in in seven months of just operating my business it was so clarifying how to do this and it just made me realize man more people should do this I'm going to come on the podt and at least say it so that for the people for whom it's applicable which is I would say you're an entrepreneur looking for your next next space and you're not you're not just being driven by some passion call and you are doing it more analytically let's say this is a tool or if you're a business owner and you want to sell someday and you Pro and you're at you know a few million dollars of your profit minimum um go have this conversation I'm so on board I've done this a bunch of times and I think it's so smart I think that there's this idea in Silicon Valley there was like this trick question when you're raising funding for from a VC and it says like what's the outcome here like what would you sell for and the answer that everyone pretends My Dead Body yeah I would never sell and the answer like the answer absolutely could be like I'm going to sell but the answer probably should be like well I don't know maybe we will maybe we won't but like if if we get to these numbers we can sell for this or we can IPO like the idea of like I have an exit in mind has been told to us that that's silly I think that that's that it's a very silic and valid thing because for two specific reasons one all venture capital is pre uh predicated on the idea that you're going to drive this to a billion dollars plus so if you show any weakness any hint that this guy would sell for less than a billion dollars like if he got an $80 million offer that would change his life he'll take it well then this is not a good investment for me because I'm taking all the risk of failure but I need to know that if this succeeds it could be a billion dollar plus and one of the risks of it being a billion dollar plus company is not just that the business works but that this founder will hold on and they will resist temptation so Silicon Valley investors because of fund math they need that that's why they put their values on you and say who those are your needs that's cool for you that's not my needs necessarily as an entrepreneur that's the first thing the second thing is there there's an ego Pride it seems Noble in some way to say this is my life this is my my life company I'll do this for a hundred years I think we're going to dominate this space so much it just sounds so cool it sounds so by way you I think you can do that and also this so there's this book that I love called built a hell have you ever seen built to sell no it's a popular book but it here's the premise which is like you build your company to sell because building a sellable business means you may or may not sell it but you have a company that operates well and you know what does Warren Buffett say he says like build your company so an idiot can run it because someday that an idiot will be running it that's kind of the premise here with built to cell which is like uh you know you're going to build your company to to operate well and so I think you should build your company to exit regardless if you're going to exit or not I I agree fully I guess what I'm saying is and that works for us because we don't raise venture capital for our businesses anymore we just own them ourselves but a lot of the advice you get is still from VC's because they're the loud people they're the people who are famous so you sort of take their advice even though you're not actually in their game you're in your own game and so I I think that's very very important distinction the other thing though is it does sound cooler to say I would never I would never sell this I sell sell to sell to Amazon I'm trying to buy Amazon right why do you love your boy Brad Adcock because Brad [ __ ] is all bravado he's all chess right he basically will say we're going to change the world we're going to build a trillion dollar company anything less than that what's the point and you're like oh my God this is it's it's it's intoxicating as Sam par would say it is intoxicating to be around somebody who is going only for the big shot and is not saying I'm building this to sell or that there's a path here to a $350 million exit which will you know 7x your your money he doesn't talk like that and because he doesn't talk like that it is very um attractive and it is very admirable because many of us wish that we could be as hardcore and Brave and Bold as that we're just not and by the way I don't think you have to be I don't want to play that game but when you do see someone play that game it's cool I gotta admit it is cool I agree I agree it's cool I agree and I like and I I've invested in couple like Brett Adcock I invested in and he has this attitude and I like that by the way do now that you have friends that are VCS or I mean you you sort of were one for a minute isn't it funny how um you talk to them about like your company and raising capital and you'll say no we don't raise capital and when you're friends with them it's like that's the right move yeah you know what I mean yeah exactly when you're not when you're not give you a low five they not give you a high five but they'll hit you with the low five real quick yeah they like say that's the right move now when you uh uh are tell them that and you're a potential client they say like oh that's cute uh like you know what I mean that's a lifestyle business that's good for you uh but when you're friends with them they think to themselves or they'll say like smart the irony of the VC thing is a VC does the opposite of what they want all the founders to do so they don't go all in on one idea they have a diversified portfolio they um they are not you know sort of only looking at the upside they make a ton of money in fees right so they you know they're gonna whatever when when somebody raises money so for example um what's the podcaster Harry steing just Harry stebbings just raised a400 million fund that's amazing that's incredible by the way um Harry is g to make $80 million guaranteed in fees just fees he could be the worst investor in the world why because that's he's gonna make $80 million because he's gonna make 2% a year on 400 million it's 20% over the life of a 10-year fund so just do 20% $80 million in fees guaranteed that's his floor who cares about the upside from there if you're Harry steing right all you got to do is keep the game going and raise maybe raise another fund that would be amazing right so VC's while they want you to be Allin and they want you to live on scraps and they want you to have no no diversification and stay super laser focused and they want you to go ride for the big upside they themselves have a very different uh uh picture of risk which by the way I think is a smarter picture of of risk um but it is it is just funny that that's true it's funny that that the person giving you that advice is literally doing the exact opposite with their own finances and portfolio and by the way they're not wrong because they're saying oh you wanted to play The Mark Zuckerberg game then that's how you got to play so they they are giving you the right advice for for you if you want to be doing that the $80 million fee thing I never I I never knew that I mean I I knew that they get what is it 2% when you do the math it's well 2% is misleading it's 2% every year off the top so the same reason why Financial Val we talk about Ken Fischer oh 1% that's not much 1% of your entire net assets every year off the top regardless of performance is like one of the great sort of seven wonders of the world that's the eighth if it's like that the eighth wonder of the world is that a 1% off the toop fee every year is actually becomes a gargantuan number over 10 years and so that that's the same thing with a with a venture fund like this dude God bless him God Bless America I guess he's not even in America America that's the best for they need to put a monument of Harry stebbing somewhere for raising a $400 million fund and $8 million in fees it's the $80 million Monument oh my God that'd be great that that fun thing or that Monument thing is ridiculous right this Monument thing is fascinating we got to I got to go look more into this this is great great episode all right that's it that's a pod [Music]

all right this episode is special because it's for the kids you see I have a friend named Val Val's been on the podcast Val has built a bunch of really big businesses and because I'm close to Val I became friends with his son his son's name is Isaac and he's one of the most impressive people I know not just kids so Isaac is uh 13 years old and over the past couple years he's built businesses and web apps and things like that that have made one and $2,000 a day and I thought that he was just amazing even though he's uh you know a kid his insights are pretty ridiculous and his maturity is ridiculous and I felt inspired whenever I've been able to hang out with them and so we thought we'd do kind of a fun episode where we had him on the podcast Sean and I did and we asked them all types of questions uh about his business about how he thinks and I think it'll be fun in like 10 years to look back on this and be like what was Isaac when he was like when he was younger compared to one who's older and probably a lot more successful so give this episode a listen I dig it man like these uh I like hearing from young guys like who are in the thick of it and let me know I'm on Twitter atth Samar if you like these kind of like children esque episodes and maybe we'll do more of them we'll find some young guys doing some really interesting stuff so give it a listen and let me [Music] know so Isaac I wanted to have you on because I'm friends with your father and he's been telling me for about two or three years some of the stuff that that you're working on and you started working on this I think when you were 12 a bunch of different apps and I couldn't believe what you were doing and I told sea about it but Sean doesn't entirely know wait wait Isaac how old are you 14 all right I think you're the youngest guest ever to come on the podcast so congratulations thank you're 14 years old and do you are you like I'm 14 years old I'm an entrepreneur I'm a businessman I'm a ninth grader what do you call yourself I guess you could call me like an entrepreneur but really just like a ninth grader yeah I like that entrepreneur and comma ninth grader yeah that go okay what talk talk about first about cookie duck and then we got to talk about this new one but I you need to and I want you to brag I know you're probably not comfortable with bragging but it's okay to brag here I want you to brag to Sean about cookie duck okay so cookie duck it started when I was around like 10 where we had computer time at like school we had free time on the computers and the games were always um they were always blocked on the computers right so what I wanted to do was I wanted to create like a website that allowed me to play games at school in our free time so I would just start like building little parts of code like putting little games on this website and after a while right just like me and my friends were playing it and then when covid came around what happened was everyone got their Chromebooks and then it just started spreading like wildfire so by the seventh grade already we had like over 4,000 people playing on it in like 30 minutes and your father told me that you just told a few friends and you could he would use or one of you guys would use Google analytics or something and you're like all right at this school in Long Island like 90% of the Thousand person school is using it oh shoot we just saw that another school just found out about it because now like 30 miles away there's a whole uh another thousand is that right yeah so it started out like a couple people at each School other than before you knew it like the whole school was already on it cuz it's like rare to find the website that's um unblocked on the Chromebooks all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we called it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode and so you got a bunch of games on here you got like Temple Run Subway Surfers so you have real games that people know about so do you rebuild the games or these are their games that you just embedded you just do the the cookie ducking the ability to get on to to make it so that it's not going to be blocked how do you actually do this so most of the games are just embedded so like it's unblocked on on their end okay so you just kind of if frame it or something in there and then you you figured out how to make it uh uh not get blocked how hard was it to not get blocked so once it get once it gets blocked what you really need to do is you have to create like new domains for each to get around like the blocking system and so is this a business does it make money what what what's going on with cookie deck so what happened was is that whenever you make enough links you can't monetize all of them because each link isn't big enough to be monetized I guess so in the beginning when the main cookie duck.com was popular it it was making around 1,500 a day at its peak so but eventually you know that link got blocked and you can't really monetize the other ones it's also because um the Chromebooks they're they have like a lot of anti-block anti-tracker so it's really hard to monetize what uh how was it making money just through Google ads as yeah how much how long did this last and how how much in total did it make I mean the peak lasted around the day but I don't really have like a total number but it it dropped off pretty quickly because it got blocked so you and you did this when you were how old when I was 12 all right so you're 12 years old and and you might have made would it be safe to say you made at least more than 10 grand doing this little hobby project right that money hit your bank account what are you thinking what do you use it do you go spend it do you throw a party do you invest in the S&P 500 stocks and bonds what are you doing with this I didn't really use it I mean I did like open a little Stock Investing account but not I didn't use it really so it's just sitting in a bank account yeah oh my gosh and when you're doing this is your father teaching you how to I mean I don't know how to code so you're smarter than me by a lot in probably many other aspects but definitely when it comes to this uh who was teaching you how to do this I mean for this web I did go to a coding school but for this website I basically made it all by myself and you use like uh YouTube or something yeah Google YouTube that's amazing all right and so Sean he so he did this cookie thing his dad was like bragging to me he was like dude check out my son look what he's doing and I'm like I didn't how great it was doing and then about three months ago his father sends me this other website it's called price satellite. Y and what's crazy Isaac is uh you're 14 now you go to the price satellite do.com I understand why you did this Gaming website makes total sense Sean it sounds like you're typing read what price satellite. comom is save big on luxury goods while traveling so you have Christian Dior Louis Vuitton Chanel there's all these brands so the the the gist of the website I believe is like it tells you if you want to get a Dior purse or whatever they make in a different country it tells you the difference in conversion rates and so it's like if you are in France it's 30% cheaper to buy the same product in France versus America Isaac why are you helping people save big while traveling the the reason I basically did it is basically whenever like we travel we always notice how much cheaper it is so I I saw that as like a blank um space and I think it would be good for SEO because you have every product name right and you're and you could rank on each one so it's like a good opportunity for views now hold on how do you know what's a good SEO opportunity what eighth grade class taught you that how do you know that I just I just looked and there's not really like a competitor to this already it's pretty much a blank area no one really compiled it so where are you getting the data for like the prices um per country is it is it all from their local site and you just basically compile and transcri and basically do the forign exchange take into account the vat the vat savings and then you make it all equalized basically yeah so I I got the data off like the official website and then I on like put together all the vat data along with that wow this amazing are people using this is this like out there yet no right now it's pretty small but uh hopefully we're expanding we I love how you use Wii I think that's exactly what I did when it was always just me it was always a Wii um what uh how how many people are coming to the site a day right now it's around 30 50 a day but it's been expanding pretty quickly it's pretty new and that's from search yeah do you have backlinks to it now or is it just because of the there's not there's no one else ranking I don't really have a backlinks just yet I mean I'm working on it trying to get like the name out there but I don't really have back links so Isaac where does a guy like you you're 14 years old and you're kind of like an internet hacker you're basically building cool stuff that little projects that are fun for you where do you meet other people that are doing what you're doing is there like is it Discord groups are there is it Reddit forums where do you find other people that are similar to you because I'm guessing in your school there's probably not too many people that are as far along as you are in terms of being an entrepreneur I mean quite honestly I don't really like I don't really network with other people that do this type of stuff but I learned from I guess mostly YouTube tutorials on like which way to go for like different subtopics like SEO and all that like coding I went Sean to Isaac's Bar Mitzvah uh and it was Tech did he gift you bunny dude it was the fanciest party it was the nicest party I've ever been to and it was Tech themed and so each table had like a Apple logo or uh I think there was like a Sony table like there was like it was all named after tech companies so clearly he's like passionate about this stuff do your friends think you're weird like or or do they even know what you're doing I mean they know about the website they just know it exists but right they're not buying Louis vitton bags so do you um and who do you look up to who who like if you're a teenager like yourself you're trying to be a great entrepreneur or you're You're Building cool things who do you look up to who do you think is doing awesome stuff in the world I mean I really got like my inspiration for doing like trying to build some stuff from my dad I that's really where it came and what did he uh what does he teach you or what does he tell you like what kind kind of guidance does he give you well he basically just encourages for me to like not think about what I want to do now but think about like the future and I have I have a photo of Isaac when man you must have been four years old in this picture I'll ask your father and you if we if we could put this in the video but you're looks like you're four years old and you are putting together a PC like you literally have a screwdriver and you're assembling a PC do you know what photo I'm talking about yeah yeah I was around that was for my eth birthday because my dad wouldn't let me just buy a computer he wanted me to like actually build my own computer so I was watching like YouTube tutorials before I asked him if I could build my computer I was watching YouTube YouTube tutorials on how to build a computer like what parts to pick out and for my birthday he let me do it this is amazing isn't it Sean like it's fun to hear hear him talk about this stuff Isaac you've inspired me today man you uh you doing very cool stuff and you are so far far ahead of the game you know I was still picking boogers when I was 14 years old so I can't believe the type of stuff that you're doing and I'm hope that there's people out there who are listening either their kids or maybe some young people that are listening to this that will kind of use this as a bit of a green light to build more stuff we should make like a group um you you know Isaac the only thing I would I would recommend for you is you said you don't really have like kind of a friends group or peer group of other people who are doing this I think you should do that man I think you should find the other kind of 14 to 17 year olds that are doing really interesting stuff on the internet and just be in a Discord in a group chat together because you will all get smarter faster and you'll all kind of learn from each other's projects versus just being in your own Silo on on your own that's my only advice for you not that you ask but I think that that would be uh good for you maybe we can make it the the MFM Jr Discord uh and anybody who listens to this can go can go join it Isaac do you have a goal like is there like um are you just having fun now or is it like by the time I'm 18 I want to be doing this by the time I'm 40 I want to be doing this like do you think of it that way or is it just that I want to learn how to code and this is a cool way to learn my goal right now is just to like progress my what I on my price satellite to like get like at least a million views a month like that's really my goal and I'm gonna progress from there by the way Sam you know that Meme that's going viral right now with the Olympics with the shooter the the Turkish shooter that's that's Isaac right nowac my goal is to do the thing I'm doing better that's my goal that's how far I'm gonna take this take this as far as I can what do you mean if price satellite gets a million views a month will that make uh will that be making money what's what's the plan not only ads but you have Affiliates for places that sell these bags like secondhand or they sell like uh the real reel which sells like the new bags it's just like a reseller platform and I can be an affiliate to those companies along with that isn't there a thing where people pay other people to buy it in that country and then travel or ship it to them company called like mule or donkey or something like that that was basically like oh it's cheaper in Denmark so then they find somebody who's already in Denmark to buy it on your behalf and then they're either traveling to the United States or they ship it to to you and then you you get the the discount without having to go there yeah I've seen one of those websites but I don't I don't really know too much about them I'll have to look into it and by the way why aren't you playing with like Ai and crypto and like stuff that's like kind of The Cutting Edge I am definely playing with AI so what are you doing with ai ai a lot of price satellite is built on AI so first of all like then like a lot of the code based like the web scraper the back and the front and the Styles all a lot of that was built off AI um the categorization of products done with AI and the product descriptions I can't do 10,000 product descriptions by myself so I really used AI for almost all of those you know I I wanted you to come on Isaac because you're impressive but mostly because you make me feel good I like talking to you because you make me realize that uh Life's a lot simpler than it needs than we often when we grow up kind of make it make it out to be we make it more complicated and you uh you you make me happy just hearing like well I'm just G to get a little bit better and and it's a very wonderful fresh mindset I appreciate you Isaac one more thing before you go we are the ideas podcast we're the the the podcast where people bring storm business ideas or ideas for products that don't exist that that they think should I am curious do you have any other ideas maybe that you don't have time to build right now or you think would be cool anything it doesn't have to be even fully fully baked out in your head it could be kind of a half of an idea is there anything that you've seen that that comes to mind so with along with AI I feel like AI right now everyone's trying to build like their own different app but I think that building like AI into what already have like the messaging app the phone app that's really what's going to make um AI a lot more convenient for people so instead of searching for like people places or things through like a search bar basically we just text like an AI like can you find me this can you find me uh someone who does this like a job for me and then it will like basically call a bunch of places like maybe reservations it'll find you like places in the area you text an AI and it'll book for you it'll find find new times and that's what's going to make AI um a lot more convenient for people I love it so like a a WhatsApp bot or or an iMessage that you could just text over your your AI on demand yeah just text to AI you're the man you're the man what uh just don't change keep going all right like these guys are weird no gu kept saying I make him happy uh we we appreciate you man thanks for doing this and uh keep going you're the manand [Music]

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
today we have the creator of RX bar on the podcast this guy started in his mom's basement with $5,000 and built a protein bar that he sold five years later for $600 million and he tells us the story of RX bar his new protein bar and why he's doing it again and we got to brainstorm what are four other ideas that he thinks somebody could start today Trends opportunities white spaces in the market and how he thinks about them how he even created RX bar using the same process that he's going to outline today so that's this episode with Peter theall [Music] all right so here's how I want to start this you created this this little bar the RX bar that you made I think in your mom's basement with you and your elementary school buddy you each kicked in $5,000 and five years later you sell it for $600 million which is amazing yeah and now you're back and you're doing this bar yeah the David bar which I've been eating pretty religiously all right let's talk a little bit about ARX bar and then David I want to hear kind of this story so we've I think generally the story is out there so I don't want to make you rehash too much of it could you give us like the cliff notes of the story and then I want to I want to hear about a couple things you said you read one article on Inc and forwarded it to Jared so I want to kind of latch on to that but give us first just the cliff notes of RX yeah so the cliffnotes um you know in Chicago 2010 10 11 12 at the time like there's a emerging Tech scene Groupon was there and it's sort of like if you weren't doing some sort of Information Technology you were a loser there was no attention or love to like a food brand it was it was just stat yeah it was just like no status like and so we just wanted an we wanted a good job we wanted an opportunity to be successful I had a background in food which was really helpful on on the supply chain side and then Jared's like my total counterpart like very very levelheaded um reliable organized like I'm more of like the creative type I'd say and I always like to trivialize Innovation because you know as an entrepreneur it's like you have all these ideas and it was basically like I just WR ink and I was like Hey jar I just sent it to him and I was like 10,000 bucks we could do a nutrition bar and it was like some bad article you know like nothing nothing to it what was the premise of the article what what did it say it was sort of like an inspirational thing of like you can start a business like very low cost ways to start a company basically and it's said like protein bar yeah nutrition bar it's like a Wiki how article which like showed why it's a low status thing to do right like anyone can do it you know um and I always was in nutrition bars and so we just started making you know just started we just started taking actions towards making it and right like where you starts that where you end up and the I was in a CrossFit and so we saw like uh a distribution Channel emerge it was very clear I was like I looked at the whole foods and the traditional food retail L had no idea how to get there and it was hyper competitive I was like how are we going to compete whereas CrossFit emerg these gyms are popping up 2012 13 no competition you were not allowed on the Shelf if you weren't Pio so that that was like the perfect example of an uncompetitive Market a small Market that was growing like crazy that we could go build distribution in and and we can make the product at home so just went for it and once you you know you burn the boats and just jump off the bridge and figure out how to fly and you're so you're literally making bars in like your mom's basement type of thing yeah we got we had a five court but then event got a 20 Court sort of vertical mixer and like we didn't know how to form the products we had to figure out how to like form and package and and you said uh there's this really great article you're like you know it sounds cool we we're in there just like in the lab mixing these things together and making it and you're like didn't feel cool it it it felt horrible like we people were making fun of us oh yeah like I I remember I think another thing you just can't care what people think and it's also a great test of who who actually cares about you and who's a good influence like you're the some of who you surround yourself with like you want your friends supporting you and saying no you have to work on the weekends like not saying drag trying to drag you out pull you down but yeah looking at I mean looking at from the outside looking at what we were Jared and I were doing there's no way it was successful it was going to be successful it was just some local local little thing were you doing CrossFit or you just literally saw it as a distribution Channel I was doing CrossFit yeah I I got I got I was in the part of the CrossFit religion so you take a box to your uh to your gym and you're like hey I made these yeah I just show up at with Tupperware and so there was like little consumer insights to like you what do you think and then built a relationship with the owner I'm like I would love to sell some product here and of course they're good people and you know it starts there then in the theory so it's like if it's going to be successful at one Crosser chip why wouldn't it be successful across others and so what what did it taste good so I eat RX bars all the time by the way I love them but like it the first time you open it up you it looks different than a granola bar you have to get used to like it being made out of dates and it being dark what do they say at first to the dark bar and were they were they any good at first yeah so they're they're really good at first because they're made to order so we never carried any inventory so everything was Super Fresh So that certainly helped and the cons a customer back then was all paleo people who were very s familiar with larabar so there was a familiarity to it that was um helpful for the adoption and I think uh we had this guy from fit a come on and he did the same thing at Cross he used CrossFit as the initial distribution for same reason he's like I don't know how to get into retail but I know this community I'm in this community and what he what he realized was he gave them mini fridges he's like I they didn't have a fridge already so he's like cool I'll I'll give you the fridge but then you like stock my stuff in there at the beginning and if you want to switch it out later and put other stuff in there fine you get to keep the fridge but sure enough they just like kept it going and he used CrossFit to get to like I don't know 2030 million dollars a year in sales you know CrossFit as the main engine at think time and same for us and then we we merchandised on top of his refrigerators [Laughter] um so you go and you're so you're like if this works at one it'll work at many then what you're just knocking on doors every day like what was your what was your life like we wanted to get data on convenience stores grocery stores other places of distribution that are understanding and so we we tested at all those other areas where we're more like normal markets where there's regular competition and the brand didn't work so like velocities at AC Crosser gym would be maybe 80 80 bars a week whereas the the convenience store and the local grocery store was like one or four a week so what obviously we would just rather be in every crossover gym AC on the country prior to any other distribution so we were just laser focused on putting the product where it's successful meeting the customer they shop and um the whole plan was like let's just get to scale through this this early adopter and this this this market and then let's figure out how to cross the chasm once we have some scale and we're commercially produced we're out of the kitchen um and so that was a plan so like be in the bar of cross get some scale and then figure out across the chasm once we're close to that St all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we call it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode I kind of triangulated a bunch of Articles and like your Revenue was like something like $2 million a year and then like $7 million and then like $160 million or something like ridiculous like that is that accurate and if and and if that is accurate I think that coincides with like the Rebrand making your Rebrand or your new labels the greatest value creation like to ever exist the best use of designers yeah yeah abely uh yeah basically it's like Dot and Amazon for three years and we like put our foot into some retailers and the current branding or the old branding didn't work so it's like didn't have product Market fit where we where we with our core early adopters whenever we started to go to like the mass Market or n core was like this ain't working so so basically we timed the rebranding with ril and so there was a year before the 160 one that was 36 and that was basically like getting into call it early adopters of food retail so the Wegman's and these like Publix these Regional ones that are really high quality and then once that works the larger one's adopted and so it's like 36 and then the most of the market at 161 so 736 161 that's insane well most the same thing is actually like just way we're we use profitable sales to finance the growth like there wasn't like a big Equity check that came in that Finance inventory so how does that work because that scaling is so crazy right even the even if you're super profitable at s how do you buy inventory for 36 did you have a really fast turnover or a line of credit credit personally guaranteed by your parents for 400,000 but we actually didn't dip into it which is funny so that's nice to gives you confidence and you started the business with 10 G's 10 grand yeah 5,000 each yeah it's brutal um and then so just profitable you know.com they give you cash you ship product so you're the cycle is much better um and then like it goes back to like sales cures all right we talked a little bit about the Rebrand before but who who did that you did that you hired an agency to do that like what was the genius behind that Rebrand because this was this stood out to me you know moment one and it sounds like I'm not alone that this helped like explode sales in outside of CrossFit yeah so we we hired an agency called Scott Victor very talented brand strategist but I think something I want mention that's really really important that because I get people coming wantan to do rebrands all the time and they're so fix Shad on the agency that they think the agency comes in and does it but really the responsibility and accountability goes on the brand owner to articulate the problem to solve and to communicate it in a brief for the assignment for the creative to figure out how to solve the problem what did you write in that brief so so like the output of our design is very simp like we had a name problem RX meant prescription in the mass Market but in CrossFit it meant doing something of a high standard so in the language in the culture of CrossFit doing something RX it was language so if you did a workout the first question you get is like did you do it RX and so it had a different meaning in this this culture than it did the normal American culture so so that was a problem name problem and then it was very clear RX meant nothing and it was an a avaluable name you remembered it which is nice but it was a source of confusion okay so you pull that through to the design it's the the logo and name is very small so we minimized it second we have when you formulate a product that's minimal ingredient and you can and like design the way ours is you can claim anything gluten-free soy free dairy free high protein well list goes on none of that mattered when we sampled it to people and the only thing mattered is when I flip over the back and say it's AR exper like what is it and be like it's like eating three egg whites two dat six elements four caches so that backa label thing that I referenced earlier that was a value communication and second we're in the third point we're in protein No Man's Land the market was at 20 we're at 12 grams of protein you're talking about yeah so we're kind of like for protein people they're like yeah it's not enough but if you just lead with egg whites so three egg whites is the first thing that's like our hierarchy is actually three egg whites and so that creates a lot of consumer surplus because when you go shopping at a cafe for breakfast and you get egg whites you get charged a premium so egg whites are associated with premium they're associated with quality and they're more expensive and so that was a great way to communicate sort of value and surplus so all these things are in the brief like name doesn't matter here's the only thing that matters we don't want to be paleo positioned because that is a death trap it's a laziness trap um and so all those factors are laid out in a brief and then the designer really extracts synthesizes and pulls that out and they're not they're not just a designer they're like a brand strategist so it's very important for like any entrepreneur like it's not just you got to do the work and actually design Define the problems and then you bring in an agency you um now you have this thing which I feel like you did an amazing job on the brand I think we talked about this on the Pod we're like dude did you see the RX guy he's back he's got this new bar love the name Love The Branding right off the bat can I read out some of these uh what some of the lines from his site Sean the copyrighting on the site yeah do it's beautiful your new thing is a protein bar and the whole stick is that like quest which is like a leading uh protein bar is only 20 grams of protein but 150 calories you're roughly 150 calories and like 26 or 27 grams of protein and so the copyrighting the it's beautiful it says the genius of a product is it has the protein of a meal but the calories of a snack we thank our predecessors in the protein industry but we'll take it from here meet David your protein bar idealized I saw the angel in marble and carved it until I set them free all these these are all like instant quotes or copy of the website uh be beautiful protein is essential to maintaining your Skin's firmness and elasticity and hair and scalp nail Health it participates in practically every process of a cell in your body so you're explaining how important the um protein is but then you have this one line where it's um you like have this graph on your website where you say how many grams of protein per calorie and you include Quest and Luna I think and a couple others or Laura bar something like that but then you even include Cod which I thought is ridiculous because when I saw that graph I was like wait you're telling me that David is even more protein dense per calorie than Cod and so it's quite good oh here's the part that I love you say um you know we are a company that is here to make your bodies better we're going to give you protein and it just so happens some of our products might be edible but some in the future may not be we focus on making we built tools to help you increase muscle and decrease fat and so that can come in I think that's our that's our mission so whether that's food beverage or apparel or that's what gives us permission to go create and serve um and and that came from like my observation in the nutrition bark space is like that's the most fundamental thing people want uh so we want to deliver that in the best way possible the thing that would be the most fun for us is if we got to sit down with the founder of rxart and just shoot the [ __ ] and brainstorm business ideas and we asked you beforehand we said hey this is what we like to do are you the kind of founder your brain never turns off you're always seeing you know opportunities that somebody could go do and you sent us a little list so let's start with that list and I think the fun way to do this is I'll just read the name of the thing you wrote you didn't give us any details and you kind of pitched the idea of what you see as a potential opportunity here so idea one Vaso dilator yes okay so I'm a big I I think history is really important to study in business like I think it doesn't get enough credit to like look for the patterns in history and in two so for this one in 2003 four and five I was in high school this product called NO2 came to Market and it just blew up the supplement industry in a good way um pre-workout right yeah it was like saying you got these like big pump uh was that like n explode that turned into no explode me and Ari were just talking about it she said she likes drink a pre-workout and I remember the days of taking that and it would like make me Eno explode out my butt like it was like the it was like the worst it was like cocaine except it would make you like diarrhea yeah and so what happened is people started adding different features to it but it has like having healthy blood fills like really important and if you look at the the market today it's like super call it like chains and gains like screaming to not a sophisticated all like it's just for pure gains and so I I would say there's probably an opportunity to sort of commercialize something on just the broader benefits of a healthy blood flow and you know it's like foreally for men like Ed is a huge one like I think the positioning of the market I think they're all very very very bodybuilding oriented and I think there's one for like pedestrians did you remember the the one Sean the deer one the it's like it's bucked up yeah yeah exactly it's sort of like analogous to dick pills in uh gas stations versus him yeah versus HS yeah exactly there was a guy who came in spoke at one of Sam's conferences he created um Sam what's the guy's name he created the method soap and then he's created the Band-Aid brand and he created Oli gummies or whatever vitamins that's the guy he's created three brands that are all like big and Target different categories and he talked about he goes what I what I could do I could just walk through a depart a like a store like a Target or a grocery store and it's like what do you looking for when you're walking through those aisles he goes I'm looking for a sea of sameness yeah and anytime I see a category a shelf where they're all positioning they're all chasing the same Target or they're all positioned the same way so for example he said Band-Aids Band-Aids were all sort of boring neutral try to be the color of your skin blah BL blah so they made a Band-Aid brand that was the opposite was like very loud badge of honor for for a boo boo right or vitamins looked a certain way they came and tried to do it differently yeah so do you have a similar sort of philosophy where you see let's say you know these vas Vasa dilators like they're all brod out and you're like if I just reposition the same product I would have a new audience yeah like I think ER Eric strategy is very much design or like differentiation through design in that like looking for um I don't have a clear of strategy um I just really focus on differentiation and actually like H determining how competitive a category is and how how easily you can diff differentiate with what I call like valuable novelty sorry does that mean that you actually want it to be the most competitive so then uh being very different yeah yeah so it's like you want it to be perceived as very competitive but then when you actually apply some rigor look at it it's actually not that competitive like the protein bar Market is perfect example of that like barrier entry is pretty low lots of noise on the surface extremely competitive but if you look at it there's actually like three and then a long tail and that's you so you you know it's like you wanted on competitive market um and so I work can you find an uncompetitive Market in a compe like in a perceived competitive market i' say um because like Leverage is like it's too easy to it's just the low easy to make food like relatively so it's an unavoidable like of course everything compe yeah it's like Peter teal Peter teal talks about for the best investments are ones that um seem like bad Investments but are actually good Investments and the things that seem like good Investments but actually are good Investments the returns aren't even there so you need that sort of you need to be counter consensus meaning you need to find something that looks one way but is actually another so you're saying look super competitive but when you sort of break it down you realize actually there's a pretty big opportunity that it's not as competitive as it's as it looks on the surface yeah I mean yeah exactly and and it's just it's as simple as like people come to me oh protein guards are so so competitive and always ask tell me tell me about that like how you know you just ask a couple questions and and it would be interesting that one can't e what what are those questions question tell me tell me like please explain more like what do you like they just can't explain the competitors they can only they're only they're only referencing the volume of the category like the volume of Brands but they're not necessarily actually referencing what they like uh who's good who's not and then second a lot of times they're they're not even consumers of the category which to me is the opportunity it's like all right well why aren't you the consumer in the category it's some dissatisfaction with taste or Texture usually or Price or some something else and so that's the opportunity actually it's like how do you bring new people to the category um so yeah just stuff like that it's just funny that's cool so let's take this Vasa dilator thing for a second in the first 90 days of that what would you be doing to figure this out like what what do you actually go do to to get these answers oh so first I'd figure out I look at the literature and is it good or like just it's like two searches one what is the internet say like what what is the reputation of it what does culture say about it and then two what does the actual literature say so like what is the what are theas of the world what is fber Wayne Norton what do they believe through through syndicating the actual literature does that basically just mean like uh like is the perfect blend of that like a Vaso dilator is good and then you also see like Eno explode looks way too broy and is lame or do you want yes yes on the culture or do you what why why the two what are you looking for as the perfect answer for those two so on the cultural thing is it senen would be like a a landscape like what does the market look like but before that I would just say is this a reputation that I can overcome is there some sort of stigma that is it's good if it's it's okay if it's contrarian but is it is actually something so bad I can't overcome it or like what is reputation just general um and then second would be like or what's like this Market map like how do I Define this market and I Pro I don't I I what what what I know i' probably just Define it as simply like bodybuilding oriented there isn't actually a Continuum of like you know natural people bodybuilders like that's like a natural opposing Continuum but um yeah so just a study study the market uh reputation of the market market and then most importantly because because if if the market says this is bad then that it's and but the literature says it's really has all these benefits then that's a contrarian thing of like all right people disagree with you but then there's so so it's it's sort of triangulating those those things Sam you invested in Lucy right yeah so Lucy the like nicotine gum our buddy John cougan involved with it there's and now it's a it's a pouch pouch yeah they um at the time I think the sort of cultural stigma this is Preen being really popular was uh yeah nicotine equals bad right aren't we supposed to be not having cigarettes bad nicotine bad blah blah blah science actually showed that there were some I guess some benefits and then what they did was they were like cool can we overcome this and it took actually many years but the business is now exploding but you know for years it was kind of you know just trying to get enough momentum culturally to get over the hump yeah and and that that's so like the Peter Teal's approach to consumer is actually how you make money in this business and there's plenty of examples like kombucha protein bars are constantly this because no one thinks there's there thinks there's too many of them um collagen was one um nicotine's one you know you know another one that's happening right now creatine so uh creatine the science is it's one of the most studied supplements of all time it's like there's so many benefits but for years it was like this is only for football high school Bros like you know and now we've made it cool or now like women are like no there's actually a lot of benefit here or normal Average Joe's like there's a lot of benefit here the whole creatin movement Sean have you seen that right now yeah definitely yeah I was saying like the way you figure it out is just ask your friends like hey what do you think of this and it's like oh it's it's sort of that's and that's like cultural reputation right so that's people are kind of disagreeing with you so I that's say generally like if they ask what my pattern is for sort of consumer investing it's really that like what is something on the fringes or what is something people people disagree with or is it in culture that actually if you look at it from a first principes perspective there's actually something there so want one more question before we move move to the next idea which is I'm a smart guy I can almost talk myself into anything or talk myself out of anything I have a very good debater in my own head and so what you're giving examples of is maybe things that are misunderstood or it looks competitive but actually it's not I can almost see myself justifying anything under that umbrella yeah hey Peter kind of said this and I just don't have the actual judgment to be able to do it correctly that's an example of an idea Sean of a product well I actually want to ask you about the opposite which is like what are categories that you think you would like run away from you're like no no this is the type of thing I wouldn't go into for these reasons fast anything fast following like following liquid death following alip pop you got you got to be the first one in the controversial disagreeable thing you can't you know yeah because you're trying to win big and I think I read something the other day like a in the AI category Sequoya was about they like if you just study all markets the market leader so number whoever becomes number one of a new category will take something like 75% of all the profits 50% of all the revenues and whatever it's just like the the spoils really do go to the winner if you're trying to win the biggest yeah and I think you could you look at the history and this is why I think history is something I just like think is so important in studying consumer like that that would be true with that would that that would be true with kombucha collagen Market these sort of big breakthrough new markets that emerg like the first one to do it well takes all the profits are you when you when you say you're studying history what does that mean like you're reading biographies you're you're looking at Old financial statements what are you doing uh it's it might you know be like one one would be looking through your phone at the old category so like what did it what did photos of the category look like in 2012 but it for me it's my own just experience going through it and remembering you know the different Trends the different new products that you know and just keeping that recollection of that and I think it just isn't talked about when I see people starting consumer Brands it's kind of like oh here's today here's the future it's just such an important piece of like in the equation of whether this is going to work or not but yeah I don't there's no there's no one writing books on this stuff and no one cares so it's really you have to just you have to piece together your pie together and yeah all right let's go to idea number two I don't even know what this means night occasion in general I don't know is an idea what is that okay so and I feel I view myself as like an anthropologist so if you look at the morning occasion uh it is very fixed right it's all around coffee waking up sunlight sunlight observation is a new one thanks to I think sh's a big change culture in that way so Cadian Rhythm um taking supplements maybe or morning pills whatever rituals there are the the morning occasion is kind of like clear in terms of like what products or services are there and so sleep hygiene and the Sleep occasion is something that become very clear that's super important and if you look at that to me it's a wide open like there isn't a coffee of the Sleep occasion at night you have what like magnesium maybe or something like that right it's like one maybe cat product yeah no one's owning it right now you brush your teeth right so there's like cold Gates got it you got but like there is a huge opportunity to sort of be the brand for that occasion there some obstacles obviously but um to me that's like the if I'm an entrepreneur I'm really studying that that's a strange insight to have what made you get to that conclusion you just got to think about everything's occasion based right like the best example is like champagne dominates a celebration occasion it's a outside of that it's a terrible problem right or for like for RX bar it's like I'm driving somewhere I want I'm going to a gas station and I want to get something healthy yeah like AR is obviously on the go is a big occasion but to be honest it was egg it was because of the egg whs there was some signals it was breakfast it was sort of like a great Fast breakfast but I think about like everyone's talking about sleep you have eight sleep you all these Brands kind of getting there but on the consumer like the food or beverage or supplement side there's all these like sleep packs things but there like the real opportunity is like how do you be the coffee of [ __ ] sleep and that's where I would spend time you know coffee is the best drug it's the biggest drug uh so is there something like that there's some Brands working on it but that that I think there's there's which promising ones uh there's one called um uh Moon Brew there's one called beam I use both of them one has melatonin one doesn't that's the big controversial one melatonin is actually sort of you could have melatonin was actually something that could be um contrarian um people say it's bad for you it's heop forat it's exogenous hormone but then there's also that's high in antioxidants too those are good but I me and my fiance we find we find ourselves having this like this beverage at a small dose before bed and it's like a nice ritual yeah I think that's brilliant actually the uh the mar basically like looking at moments and looking for for openings there's a Chinese company I think it was maybe it was bite dance the company that owns Tik Tok maybe it was the one that owns WeChat not sure but they uh at their annual meeting I remember going and watching their annual meeting which was weird cuz it's all in Mandarin I don't speak Mandarin but I'm like sitting there trying to translate these slides because I was like I want to learn from where other people are not learning from to try to see if there's any Alpha there and one of the key interesting things was they their opening slide was all of the moments of the day like so a 24-hour cycle broken into 15 minute intervals and what they did was they were like we want to have a product or an app for every moment of your day like totally dominating philosophy like insane American companies you couldn't come out and say it but like obviously Zuck probably feels the same way but they were like you're inline for coffee what's the inline coffee app like we need an app that is designed to be awesome for that moment okay now you have an hour in bed scrolling at night what do we have for that that's like the Tik Tok app where you're just going to infinitely swipe and be amused and so seeing them think that way I was like oh wow and then that creates white spaces so you say oh you might think photos is a crowded category like it seemed like photos was dominated by Facebook and Instagram and then Snapchat came out was like oh well use photos for messaging and instead of photos for memories and the way they the way they just looked at it with a different lens suddenly photos was totally of a wide open multi-billion dollar opportunity that you had to look at it in some other angle um in order to see it yeah I just emphasize like the consumers all the matters and so putting yourself and empathizing and going through that is the that it's where it all starts in my view yeah I like that do you also look for like inspir product inspiration from other places like I know some people that do cpg that're like they travel a bunch or they'll be like oh yeah in Thailand they drink this what is this oh if we just take this and now we wrap it in a new label that's like American friendly we might be able to have a product here so basically you want to consume as much information collect as many dots so you can connect the dots at some point and the best example of that is like I had an internship in Belgium and we supplied innocent beverage which is a smoothie company and in their label they they would the Innovative thing they did is they would um and the greeni statement would be like one apple one banana and half a Le lemon or a pinch of lemon and obviously I took I took that dot and connected it to our xar which on the back of our label was uh two dats three eggs six almonds four cashews Etc but that Insight was from just purely observing different markets and and different brands different you're just like journaling or to keep keep track of these or it's all just in your head it's in the yeah it's just in all right let's finish up these ideas I want to ask you about the bar bu all right so idea number three continuous testosterone monitor this is pry fascinating oh yeah yeah I think the the the American male cares so much about testosterone and I think I don't know if this is feasible I mean we do blood tests so and I actually like looked into this for like 10 minutes um but if you were to have some way to measure testosterone or some broader hormones in a continuous way so like when you wake up IM moderate like I I think there's there's a lot of demand for that and I think the American male was love that Sam you're the American male what what are your tea levels right now dude I want to know my T 247 are are you are you 400 where you at is it higher than your math SAT score was or that that's the test I don't even what's the sat out of I don't even know what uh do not you don't get yours check Sean I've I've never got I don't think maybe I got it checked once I don't think I've ever really I definitely am not the the typical American male wait Peter do you do you have you you get yours checked yeah I do it quarterly do you have uh by the way I uh I'm was an investor or am an investor in that thing called levels which is a continuous glucose monitor and like uh yeah yeah everyone has to figure this out and if you do figure it out it's pretty awesome but do you have some like because you're friends with like uh I think Peter Tia is one of your investors because you're a young rich guy in the health space do you have some crazy Brian Johnson setup where you have someone measuring your nighttime erections and all this crazy stuff no I so I've gone from like getting close to being obsessive about measuring everything to just now I'm like totally over it's like so easy to overdo it my my routine is um I'm currently off supplements right now I just want to get a baseline of my blood markers I test it quarterly um and then normally I take um supplements in the AM and PM I think I think culture is going that way this is my this is my prediction for 2025 which is that I think everybody gotta really inspired and sort of overanalyzed everything through huberman and Brian Johnson I love those guys but I think the uh the average person it's way too much work for way little way too little payoff and um and we all kind of know the sort of core four or five things you should do and most people don't even do those and so without doing the basic fundamentals like none of the rest really matters the the sort of fine-tune optimizing and so I think there's going to be a giant Retreat back to simple Simplicity and basics for like Health craze so for the listener Brian Johnson's like a tech billionaire who like the headline is he spends $2 million a year on his health to live forever whatever he's got this thing called the Rejuvenation Olympics where you can get your blood work done and it ranks you like on a uh amongst tens of other thousands of of people to let you know like how good your blood work is and how long you're going to live whatever there was this woman in the in the Wall Street Journal uh she was like a substitute teacher and she's like she's like sets her income she's like I make like $50,000 a year and I just go for walks and I eat healthy and she was number one on on the list and like Brian Johnson was like number six and it and it was pretty funny that all these guys are dedicating their lives and all their resources Bingo KN that you need with the community yeah and I think it actually causes like you emotional regulation and not being stressed or anxious is probably more important than like obsessing about some other stuff so exactly all right let's do the most exciting idea you have on this list new religion talk to me I'm ready preach sort of I religion I think it's a bad word it's like something to belong to that helps you guide morality and ethics that can be a ritual or tradition that um we all can like Bond over and feel aligned on my my hypothesis is that there's no money to make in religion so no one joins no Talent no good leader joins the church and therefore it hasn't been innovating at all and therefore so the economics aren't there for a priest and so therefore there's no innovation and there's a desperate need for Innovation and then so and then second like no one wants to be Jesus and someone has to be Jesus that's why I think why we are where we are at right now so if someone wants to be Jesus I think there's a real opportunity [Laughter] H have you guys ever gone to a Shabbat no something like that dude the [ __ ] it's the best Shabbat is the [ __ ] I love it it's like basically a Friday meal where you don't use cell phones and you tell everyone how much you love each other yeah and like Saturday I'm not working like forced and I just think that's pretty obvious we want that why are you saying there's no money in it i' these mega churches have1 million run rate the priests are driving private flying private jets like these have you seen Joel oin that smile that's a billion dollar smile right there so I think maybe it's like actually the best business of all businesses it just I I'm pretty sure that the Catholic church is the largest land owner in in the whole world not not to reference Peter Tian but he talks about for monopolies he's like all the companies that talk about how how much of a monopoly they have how dominant they they are they're usually the most vulnerable and the ones that are super dominant always try to downplay how dominant they are want anyone to to take aim at them you know for antitrust it's the same thing I think for money it's like the folks that are bragging about how much money they make are the drop shippers and then the people who are silent pretend it's not about the money have all the money and that's the the churches you're I think it's probably totally right I so I misread this but um maybe I should be a priest well I've thought about this a bunch of ways I think you can you could either unbundle it so you know one strategy for business is unbundle things so take things that come in a bundle so you get God and a higher power your going to get community and a r a Sunday ritual and then you're going to get an operating Philosophy for life and so that's the that's the current religion bundle and then then you see things like you know look at the NFL every Sunday look at Soul cycle look at these these things where it's like oh they're giving they have they have two other components but not the other three right uh but then there's Tony Robbins he'll maybe give you the operating philosophy without God and and for me for example that resonated I was like cool I want this without the but I you know I'd like to be in charge of it and not not sort of say it's somebody else that that's deciding my fate and so I think some people have unbundled this but it would be very interesting to see somebody actually try to provide a new bundle and I think I think you could really just like it's a first principal approach but like across the different domains of life like who's got it right like the Buddhists have got stuff right the Jews got stuff right sure Islam's got stuff right Christianity too and just sort of build like sort of look at it from that perspective I bet you'd come up with something great you actually have a uh it appears to be a fairly academic point of view when it comes to uh operating a business and I think that that's actually pretty cool because I think it's considered like cool to not care or like I'm just gonna file my gut which uh I tend to fall in that category but to hear your kind of academic point of view I actually think it's pretty neat right you I wouldn't call it that but I I guess from you're yeah I mean I just it's like I'm a terrible student but I study a lot what does that mean I I was like literally a terrible student but I do like all I do is my free time is study yeah it's actually nice for me because I I kind of uh I do the same and then sometimes I meet people who are 10 times more successful than me and they're like yeah I don't even think about all that stuff I'm like oh wait am I wasting my time but you're like oh yeah we looked at this it seemed like really good distribution or I really thought that you know for the for the design agency the inputs matter as much as the inputs will will dictate the outputs and so I was super clear on this whereas like I think a lot of successful entrepreneurs just sort of handwave and I get the sense that it's not really as handwave as they think and it either they're downplaying it or or they're kind of like Michael Jordan you're like how do you shoot a jump shot he's like I don't know I just just do it I don't really think too much but I like that you're able to articulate some of these things because at least for someone like me that that resonates because that's how I think so you know it's I would perhaps say like they're not as introspective they're probably not analyzing why they came up with what they came up and they're probably not they're just like I think a lot of entrepreneurs are all about like charging forward and moving forward I'm always sort of like looking back and studying the the past of like why did this work was it a framework can I come up with a framework was it a pattern well let's do a little introspection on why do David because you've on one hand one way of looking at this is you've already beat this level of the video game you created a prot team bar you won $600 million you get the nice house in Miami and it's all done right and of course you could go back and do it again but maybe like you should do a new thing that would be one argument we we we me and Sam talked about this before there's two you know type one type entrepreneurs type ones are always looking for the variety the next new thing even though they're most equipped to actually go do the thing that they know really well they don't want to do it and then there's other people we call speedrunners this type too which which is now that they feel like they have a a new point of view new Mastery of the game they're really excited to go do it this is just in their blood it's in their DNA they just want to go back to the same space I don't know if it's as simple as that but why did you decide to do it again yeah so it was in process so I had an knock with Pete so that was a constraint but then I I wanted to actually prove to myself that I wasn't just a cpg entrepreneur that I could go do this in other s Industries um so I actually I went to go explore different Industries and try to like and I I I kind of like started and stopped in a lot of times what sorts of stuff give us a sense synthetic biology I think is like fascinating that's a perfect example I was like this is sounds like science fiction biotech is incredible like if we can actually control biology like this would be an amazing thing so I started studying it and you know this is where I think like elon's like a not a good influence like I was like oh he could like I can like learn anything and then very quickly it was like I can't [ __ ] learn this stuff like biology these people like spend their whole careers learning this and I was like I'm not that smart I can't learn new things and I'm never going to start a business where I have to pick up the phone to fix a problem like if I can't don't have the competency to fix the problem or understand it I'm that's like a position I'll never want to be in that was a bit of like self-awareness call it a humbling moment and I spent some time then I came back and then when my non compete came up I was like oh my God I see it like I I I I couldn't help but see like a vision of something to do and so I was like you know what I'm okay I'm okay with just being go to type two um and I'm okay once I die it just says like nose protein bar you know like that's what I'm know for on my gravestone that that's okay like U and and it goes back to like self-a awareness like you got to do what you're good at and like one thing I've learned is like as I gotten older I'm 38 now like I I do find it harder to learn new things like I'm I'm a later adopter why I do it again is like I see a huge opportunity to bring to grow the market to Delight customers and its far are you calling the shots are you uh the CEO and are you uh like a very hands- on CEO or are you doing it are you chairman no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm the CEO and I'm in the office every day I'm at manufacturing right now I only have one way when you uh you have a four-month-old kid it sounds like you're G you're G to get married soon um you know a lot of people in your position who imagine you have roughly in the ballpark of nine figures liquid that's enough money for many generations you have a new kid where you could be at home with them why do you even give a [ __ ] about starting this new thing I think the idle mind is a Devil's Playground but you've had an idle mind no for the past few years yeah but I still made myself busy but but it was ID it was idle relative to to it now yes um I just think it's dangerous like I need to produce I need to make stuff I need stress I need to be challenged I need risk I'm a way better man with responsibility and then second I I want to make sure my son sees daddy working working hard and be a role model for him I need to be in an office I need to be sacrificing and then like a fundamental of like as a human I'm just I'm not happy if I don't I'm not like Risk on I don't have responsibility so that does that mean you you were kind of bummed out or like for the past few years yeah I just was unfulfilled like I I was just like and like being an investor sucks I like yeah dude it's it's pretty boring isn't it well like the only good thing about it is you're you can like you have um more freedom of time and responsibility like that's the great thing about it and I just don't actually like that have you ever seen this Reddit post by the this guy Jake who started movement watches no they were one of the early DDC Brands they made a watch brand that got really big off of Instagram and he wrote this thing on Reddit which I think you would never expect this guy to be here right they they sold it for I think $100 million doar you would never expect him to just be lurking random like beginner threads about entrepreneurship and he wrote a thread that he says I sold my company for Millions and I'm lost more than ever 31 years old he he says it pretty openly I sold my company movement for a lot of money I thought all my problems would be solved it made my life really cushy and comfortable I optimize for being as stressfree as possible I play video games when I want I wake up when I want I have really no reason to get out of bed if I don't want to I always thought this was the dream and I'd be happy forever until I wasn't and I realized I'm in this incredibly unique situation I want to share some things and then at I'll just fast forward there's a bunch of stuff he talks about I've been separated from the company for 2 years I'm 31 single I never have to work again I'm I'm also lonier than ever and deeply depressed I really believe that we need purpose in our lives to be happy for some that's raising a family others it's their career blah blah blah and then he goes to the bottom and he just says we can plan and analyze forever but here's the lessons uh but there are lessons that are unknown until you start moving forward you cannot live without struggle and pain we either choose our struggle and pain or it will find us through depression and loneliness I thought that was really powerful what he wrote and you in my point my Fe him be like you have to work he said you don't have to work like you have to just not for money it wasn't for money that you had to work it was for yourself yeah yeah just like you need to produce I want to bring up this article that uh you that got written about you um it was on medium you know what I'm talking about yeah it was like a super sensationalized terribly upgate and she was just projecting I thought that was gonna be the case I told Sean was gonna bring it up and he goes he's this is what he's probably gonna say and uh Sean nailed the prediction but for anyone who's talking about who's thinking about uh or the article I'm describing it's basically the head it's beautiful photos but it's kind of like they kind of paint this article as the Lost young rich guy who doesn't know what the hell he's doing in life and is unhappy and like the photos are like you like looking off to the distance but there was one pretty amazing the pro tip Prof Founders anytime somebody wants her an article about you and they want you just take photos looking longingly out the window they're about to [ __ ] you that's what they're trying to do and just don't take the photo and don't do the article the paragraph goes uh uh so so Peter bought a fully furnished house for $19 million in may he splits his time between here and Chicago he chose Miami because there's no income taxes he has a Ferrari and a vesa vesa parked in the driveway a housekeeper who comes daily keeps the seven room bedrooms spotless the most are usually empty like just little Jabs right there like and then she basically says uh this looks like a place that ticked a box requesting the newly Rich Bachelor package and this setup fell straight from the sky just like constant Jabs dude first of all ended it crazy that you probably spent the the whole day with this woman and you and you probably became friendly with her and that she just kind of like yeah and like she she couldn't like I'm very introverted and I love being alone and I never once said I was unhappy it's more that like she was projecting what she would be like she like couldn't imagine living here alone and I'm like this is [ __ ] great like it was just like it just shows like you can't trust media like the story was supposed to be about my process for finding my next business but it was it was still a good article uh like there was some cool insights of it's like what what a little bit about your background story and and the photos are are dope one of the things Sam and I like to talk about when we both sold our companies we were like the day you you know there like this whole process of like the the Journey of this the thing and then you're like gonna sell that's kind of a stressful time and it's just kind of like relief when you sell at least that was how it was for me and him it's like more than what you think should be just exuberance was actually just relief that the process actually like finished and it was it was successful and like your employees are all a good spot like everything worked out but then there's like you know that that post exit right U figuring out what you want to do see you know go to the ATM you print out the balance the first time you're like holy [ __ ] this is cool um do you have any of those moments that you remember that were just memorable for you just like unique human life experiences that you had going through it um that's the first question the second would be like you know if your cousin or your brother was going through this or was about to do it what would you kind of tell them what would you advise them now that you've been through it yeah I would say my going through through the process it took me a while to like actually comprehend the money had you taken money out of the business before that no no so I went from basically like you know 75k a year to it's like really crazy money so um that process took me a while and in general like that's just like financial literacy it's just not I don't I'm not have a good instincts on it for some reason so it took me about a year to like realize what it was um and then going through it like I just like I just maybe it's like I have kind of like low self-esteem from being dyslexic I think so I didn't think I was great you know what I mean I I just don't think I'm that special and then I didn't realize like you just get treated differently you also were living in uh maybe not the most friendly or U not the most Miami is not the best place to be I think well you could say it's the best place to be for the newly rich or you could also say it's it could be a pretty bad place to live if you're newly rich and a young man who's single like it could be it could you could go you become a dgen pretty easily yeah yeah if you're to have discipline it's a really dangerous place but it's actually a great place because there's a lot of high Network people there that you actually can learn from the issue with Miami is that there is no residue of the actual building it's just the outcome so you don't see the office you don't see you don't hear the stories you just see the outcome and so it's a bunch of like it's yeah it's the byproduct of all it you don't see the proc any any Revenant of the process and so that's what's dangerous about Miami on wealth management and I would just Define the different sort of options like you can go with Goldman they're going to fee you they're going to make you feel good you know just go through sort of like how to manage this money that because that's what you need to get you you immediately need to figure out what to do and how to do it and there's sort of like different categories and approaches based on your risk appetite or what you want to do so that that's what I wanted help with and I would help someone is like here's how you should think about it and here's how like help them not waste their time all right I want to ask you two questions first one is real simple how big can this be David as I'm 75% away through this bar right now I would how big so the market I think it's it's like a say8 billion doll Tam the protein subcategory for me the big exciting opportunity is to convert non-protein bar people and bring them into the category so so like just interviewing people they'll they'll often say I'm not a protein bar consumer so I want if we can achieve the mission of bringing converting as many non-protein bar people into protein bar people that would be huge I see a clear path to a billion in sales top line is that your threshold for success that's a good question Enterprise Value yeah I would say yeah I would want billion in Top Line what's that worth depending on grow grow and eidal you put a three or five on it I love how you don't shy away we have a lot of people that come on this podcast that they want to win and they want to win big and they want money and they want they want things right we all want things and whenever Sam will ask a question like that of like does that would that be would would anything less than that be like not a success for you or something like that they'll like always go back to like what they think they're supposed to say oh no no no this doesn't Define me I'm as long as wake up every day and my my wife kisses me on the cheek I'm good and um I love that you don't give a [ __ ] and I see that in a bunch of quotes we have this quote section I just want you to react to some of these my favorite by the way don't trust a guy who celebrates his birthday through but not but it's kind of true you talked about how most people don't really experience any adversity and you said quote most people are soft as baby [ __ ] expand that yeah I just think it character shap I think it's like anyone a really high character usually is some trauma trauma is relative and if you haven't gone through trauma it's fine but just if you're just self-aware of it like that's a first step you do things now even though your life could be very comfortable you got a bunch of money you could you could make your life as comfortable as you want it do you do things now that kind of voluntarily make your life less comfortable than you otherwise could uh um without sounding like a rich [ __ ] like no I mean I'm I like the rich [ __ ] [ __ ] version of you to sound like that like he's like I have one Butler not three now it's tough out there like oh go to the nightmares like that's such a like you know sounds so terrible uh no I mean so I think like that pH being like physical exertion and doing physically things hard is the easiest way to do adversity and that's why like you see a lot of people doing that and so that's easy but my company's a priority and the first thing to go is my health like it's my company my family my family's probably more important now but like I'm not as more I'm not my family's more important then my company and then me and so my health is the first thing to [ __ ] go is there um is your new company in um in person or remote what do you think yeah I made the biggest dude he's like have you been listening yeah I was hoping there was like a I was hoping there was like a 3% chance my company we we we started it like kind of like right after Co I've made such a mistake dude we did remote and it's like an irreversible thing yeah if you want a high performing company if you want to win it's you obviously have to do it and the thing is like why Works fun so being the office well that's why I'm do it I don't care about the winning it just it's fun it's fun to be around your like to become your friends oh and that's the thing is like my social bucket is fulfilled through my work colleagues like so I don't really socialize outside my work yeah I mean it's I was in the same boat you just you give someone a job you you're hired want to be friends yeah my PA friends are the best friends I found my W2 friends are awesome yeah well dude Peter I know we're a little overtime so we we'll we'll let you go but uh you're awesome I really appreciate you coming on I think your story is dope I think you're very truthful and self-aware and that's a pretty deadly combo it's something you know I think two virtues to strive for and I think you have a hardcore approach to this at a time where it is unpopular to be hardcore uh you almost have to apologize for like caring and trying and working and prioritizing stuff I think there's a bunch of people who will listen to this that want that also and and will feel more empowered to do it in the same way that you were saying like Elon let you think wait [ __ ] can I do anything right like it gives you permission to like you know to be a to be the way you want to be and I think uh you've done that today on this pod so I appreciate you coming on thank you guys [Music]

you said you tried to buy a Halloween Express basically we tried to buy it because we saw it was $600,000 for three or four retail locations plus whatever last year's inventory was and then the wild part about spirit and Halloween Express they have the same model which is like every store is 10,000 square feet the average retail store costs Millions to throw up and takes months and spirit or Halloween Express costs maybe $1 to $50,000 to throw up and is up in days or weeks how much would a business like that make so three locations open for 2 months a year they would bring in a million I think it was like $950 or something

you need to create a wh label Enterprise sales team quit trying to hire programmers whatever I want you going out there recruiting the guys selling Cutco knives I want you going to the mall finding the most Hustler guys selling that shoe soap stuff and I want you to start building them and training them on how to sell B2B sass if you are looking for an aqua hire salespeople are in high demand if you have guys that can sell and girls that can sell this company will get bought I don't care what you're selling but start collecting salespeople and build a sales team you'll either get bought out you can build a SAS around it or you'll just get Aqua hired in this is a good business idea so this leads me to my next business idea I am going to do potentially if enough people ask me for this the first seven figure Millionaire Matchmaker that is only based on a contingency fee so I'm going to have no cost I'm only going to take the top-of-the toop clients we're talking people like um I'm not going to name names but but folks that have a minimum probably 50 million net worth 5 million social followers I'm going to be matchmaking for these people and if they get married only success Gentleman's Agreement handshake million doll minimum success fee okay I got another business idea I think we should bring back web hosting companies specifically Services agencies to help local small businesses build very basic WordPress websites we poo poo these simple ideas notice what the focus is the focus there is sales can you sell it to them but you go to somebody you say look for 50 bucks a month I'm going to host your site I'll make sure it doesn't get hacked I'll keep it lightly updated you know you can buy an additional thing if you want to make updates but this is a SAS business you are now creating websites where you are selling them this service hacker web hosting whatever you're just doing the basic stuff I think we think that we have to come up with this new AI stuff go back to the basics like start making web pages for restaurants in town and start at the basics I think we need to bring back web hosting companies which brings me to my next business idea Airbnb experiences if you are interested in starting a new side hustle you can sign up on airbeam experiences to lead a tour in your town and charge people for it this is a way for you to immediately start to get money from people searching for cool things to do now this only works in major towns where they've launched Airbnb experiences but it's generally tier one and tier 2 cities find your favorite stuff do tours for locals show them around to some of your great stuff provide a great experience beg for five-star reviews and you can literally create a side hustle on airb BNB experiences here's the next one it's a similar one cuz you may not like doing tours like I'm not a tour guide Geek Squad type neighborhood computer service I'll give you one that is a genius I was hanging out with a friend yesterday her laptop was disgusting the screen is all smudged up there's cookie crumbs in the keyboard there's all this stuff and I've had this fantasy of doing of dressing up and just going door too to help fix people's stuff talking boosting their Wi-Fi cleaning their computer helping them with some basic tech support stuff measuring the power another pet pea mine is a lot of people have really bad cell phone chargers and cables they're not charging with USBC with the full max power new business idea it's Geek Squad as a service where you go door Todo maybe even just to clean up their laptops and phones I found this Gunk online that's this like gel sludge that you put into keyboards to suck up all the Dust in the dirt you can walk around with a little toolkit and for $100 make some massive improvements for people all you need for that is about $100 worth of supplies you need a little bit of knowledge on the tech side and need to dress up nice and look respectable but thinking about these things that don't necessarily scale do those things start there you need to get your hands dirty in these type of environments that's my suggestion I got a riff on your idea your Geek Squad thing I think it's a simple version of it which is every uh parent I know that's like kind of like my parents age has this box in their house of just old home videos and so I think an even easier one versus like can I help you with your stuff is just to say hey do you guys have any like home videos from your kids uh because I can convert them into stuff that you can have you know on your computer on the internet so you'll never lose them they'll live forever can't even find a VHS player anymore so I can take if you just have that box I'll just take the box and I'll do it for you and then you basically D it to like you know CVS or Costco and they do the for you but like there's a gap there where most people don't they're not really aware of the problem or it's on their to-do list they'll never do it but if a kid showed up at their door dressed nice million dollar smile and said I'd love to take care of that for you I'm doing that for people in the neighborhood I could take it from you right now just show me the closet where it is and I'll go grab it I think that you can make you know an easy few thousand dollar um you know in a couple months of effort effort there which sounds like not that much but you know at different phases of your life a few thousand is all the money it's all you need right and and it gets you going listeners next experiment that you need to be doing bring back blogging you need to fill the AIS and the AIS need to have data from the public web to scrape I've been saying this for a long time blogging needs to make a comeback take some of your best Tweets put them into your blogs if you need to you don't have to create new content but just put the stuff you're sharing elsewhere into blogs a great example of that is my own monthly Recaps if you go to nickg grew.com you go to the blog you click the monthly Recaps I take some of my best posts and I put it there on the blog on the public internet in order to scrape and you need to do this for a few reasons but one of the reasons is for nefarious purposes I wanted to find a list of all of the Equinox gyms in New York City that had swimming pools very hard list to find and so I made my own list of all the Equinox gyms with swimming pools it's started to rank pretty quickly as the number one search result for other people searching for the same thing unfortunately my gym started to get very crowded and I would have to wait for the lanes to swim at my gym and I'm getting 50 100 visitors a day to this page and so I uh closed my gym swimming pool according to my blog for maintenance for a year so that I would have to wait for less people and people would say hey they'd go there they'd say hey guys sorry this pool's closed for a year you know we're resurfacing the bottom pavement but these are some other nearby pools and yeah so that's jail SE listen Sean Google like nickr Equinox he has a PDF on his website download download my full list of Equinox uh gyms with pools and you could and and if you sign up we'll send you uh the pool links for each of the New York City Equinox pools you know I got that lead magnet for the friends newsletter brother I'm magnet yeah you're going to be you're going to have just dozens of pool fans in New York to worship you all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just

I understand you have something called the Nick method I don't know what the Nick method is what is the Nick method for hosting a party the main thing I want your listeners to know is that I found that interesting people want to meet people that are doing interesting things and the fastest way to become interesting was for me to host my own events so we talked before about those business ideas that you don't need a lot of capital for hosting events is kind of the same way you can do it with very little money each party should Cost You Less than100 $ these strategies start from beginner to advance and I've helped hundreds of people to host their very first party using this method so the Nick method to host a party will absolutely level up I'm going to do harmonic on this because if you do this one thing you will level up your events to be so much better and the reason is that the bar is so low for a successful event think when somebody invites you to like a company happy hour you're just people standing around at open bar it's like bad that's that's the old way and the future can change if we Bend our will to make it do that you can do that with the Nick method when you host events n c k like my name the n stands for name tags fill out the name tags first name only big block letters the name tags I like are the qualek 300s I also like the Avery 54 24s the qual 300s come in six different colors and you guys may know those they discontinue the 5420 sixes which was really sad actually it's the Vintage you should you should completely make up the model numbers by the way and just see if anyone ever finds out and be like I've been waiting I have an envelope for the it's a golden ticket it's like for the first person that realized that I was completely making up the model numbers of these name tags you are my fellow nerd I may have got those model numbers wrong why do the name tags matter because I went to a party with of yours and at first I was like okay this a second grade this is cheesy but then it was kind of useful obviously because I don't remember a lot of people's names but it seems like there's more to it than that what is the like what's the why behind the why the why behind the why is it's like a sports Jersey to show everybody that we on the same team have you ever walked into an event it's the first time you've gone to something and you figure that it's me walking into something else everybody else must know each other they must all be friends already I Am The Outsider when you have name tags you show that you are all on the same team this is not a party of clicks we're all here together by the way if you host meetups you absolutely have to do name tags when you host at a bar or another public spot so you know who is there for the Meetup have you ever gone to a Meetup and it's at like a beer garden and you're like well who's here for the Meetup like oh these people it's like great I guess I'll just figure it out on my own Amateur hour all right and name tags I'm in I buy yeah and his name tags I stands for intros or ice breakers when I wrote the book I called him icebreakers but there's such a cringe reaction to the idea of ice breakers on that word so now I call them intros and this can be in small groups it can be your whole group together but what's the first thing that everybody asks when they meet you what's your name what do you do for work we're going to get that out of the way by having everybody say it real quick I think it is important by the way to say what people do especially for listeners of this pod because you never know who's looking for a job who wants to network who's working on growing their business but those rounds of intros give you an excuse It's a conversational crutch for your guests to go up and start new conversations your role gr way to do that like is there a better and worse way to do those intros or ice breakers my man of course there dude I've done more ice I I live and breathe icebreakers you have come to the right spot uh welcome to Nick party Icebreaker therapy because I've spent a lot of my life doing ice breakers um here's the deal there's two different you know uh do you know Stefan from SNL's Weekend Update that you are Stefan right now that is you that is you I'm so passionate about ice Burgers because I've seen so many bad ones you know an example of a bad one is all right everybody team meeting let's go around and say one fun fact about yourself that's a terrible Icebreaker so much of my work involves making people that have social anxiety or consider themselves introverts to feel more welcome and I know that some of them are going to hate this idea of intros but ideally what they like is to be able to know what to expect and minimal surprises and so a green level Icebreaker or intro at the beginning of an event when there's no social Rapport when people are new and a little uncomfortable is just an easy one that doesn't take time the exact question that I have most people do is hey everybody real quick let's just do a round of intros you got to say the why the why is that there's a lot of interesting people here and I really want you to go meet somebody new so we're GNA have you say your name say what you do for work or how you spend your day and then tell me one of your favorite things one of your go-to things that you like to eat for breakfast now that's a bit of a red herin because I actually don't want to know their breakfast I want to know what they do for work but we take away the attention we make them think about the breakfast the breakfast one works because it's easy it's subjective people don't judge you for it and it's not hard you don't get locked up in your head a bad example would be hey everybody let's go around name what do you do for work and tell me your favorite Business book favorite is definitive it is your absolute favorite people are going to judge me oh my God favorite what's my favorite what's my favorite so we start with a very easy one so you could do the breakfast if you want to make it a little edgier you could ask people and say your favorite Vice or say what was one of your first online screen names and why did you choose it or what was one of your first jobs that you ever got paid cash money for now those are beginner level ones I want to tell you an advanced one but I want to check with you guys can I keep going yes yes keep going as you continue the event about an hour later you want to do one one more advanced round of intros and this is what I call a value additive intro value additive means that everybody's answer adds to the benefit of the room and so for Sam for example who lives in Connecticut now say that he was hosting this in Westchester you would say hey everybody we're going to do our last round of icebreakers your question is going to be what is one of your Westchester Pro tips or life hacks or little Secrets what's a small business you support a dog park you like a hiking trail you enjoy what's the best coffee shop in town tell us one great thing in town that you like and want to shine a light on okay so that's one example one more example if you don't want to focus on your town would be hey everybody we're going to do a last round of intros and I want you to share a great piece of media that you have consumed recently what's a movie you watched a documentary a podcast like my first million like And subscribe Gentleman's Agreement uh what are some of those things that you liked and you want to share okay and then you go around the room and you do that why does this work it works because every answer gives somebody value oh I've been meaning to go to that restaurant oh my first million I love those guys oh I I heard about that book I want to check it out and you do it towards the end of your event so at the end people get all these new ideas they've met all these new people and they leave with a feeling of value they leave feeling that they're better than when they showed up that's what a good party is you did something at a party I went to of yours where I don't know you were like lurking around or you were hopping from combo to combo but then when you brought every back together you go James will you tell people that amazing uh email trick that you did that uh really improved your your open rates and the guy said something that was so useful to me that I was like that one thing alone made this party worth going to because it's like you had eyes and ears around the room so you could pluck the best kind of like Pro tip that you heard and you had two or three people go um and you just had them share with the whole group in that moment uh I thought that was pretty awesome that's an advanced tip you should be going through life collecting the interesting people that you meet and why is this helpful well it helped me launch a multi-million dollar business called Museum Hack That was launched on the back of the network that I built up from hosting all of these events I hear from a lot of people oh my God I'm going to do a startup party I'm going to do a launch party for my new app I was like awesome perfect how many events have you hosted or when was the last event you hosted oh oh I've never hosted anything I'm like bro you have a cold list like nobody knows you like no offense but like in real life nobody knows you nobody cared this is not going to be a successful launch party you need to start building up and hosting these little events by the way the perfect size for a happy hour in my opinion is about 15 to 22 people like talk forever about this but a small plug I wrote a book called The two-hour cocktail party that is really more like a workbook or a step-by-step guide that helps you actually do it and by the way if you want to go through a cohort or something you give me $100 at the end of hosting the party I'll give you the $100 back that's how it works but host might change your life the book made you like the king of the introverts because I had so many introverted friends um who like read the book and they started hosting nickr parties and I would be like walking around Austin at like 7:00 at night and in Austin all the bars are outdoor bars and I would see I would I swear to God there was this one one mile walk through East Austin of like where all the bars are and I would see multiple Nick Gray parties happening harmonica all throughout downtown Austin in the night they would be in a circle and they would we I call them we would call them name tag Nick so they always had uh Nick's name tags and they would be in a circle and could see the person in the middle pointing exactly like he tells you to do in the book I swear to God on one one mile walk I saw uh three I saw one at Lazarus one at whistlers and one this other bar it was three Nick Ray parties it was insane it's like you the introverts uh uh king for a handful of months when I would in in Austin so many of you were doing it the reason we're doing this is that people are hungry for in-person events we're all digitally saturated we want that human connection and I found that you can add value to People by introducing them to other interesting people if you're looking for a business idea if you're looking to raise your status in the world you have to start by adding value and hosting a party introducing the interesting people you know that is a way that you can add value all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

okay so maybe they found Satoshi Nakamoto which is exciting one of my favorite uh [Music] Mysteries it's a intoxicating story and I you're talking about the new HBO documentary I didn't watch it yet but like the headlines make it look amazing I have to watch it what's the what's the gist so the documentary is not amazing I'm start with that uh it's good it's good but not amazing it's interesting because the guy thinks he found Satoshi that's the only interesting part to be honest the documentary is kind of poorly made like the director makes himself a pretty big character and he also says stuff that feels like unprofessional like he'll be talking he'll be like and then you know they made nfts whatever the hell those are and it's like who like why is the narrator like so opinionated it's kind of crazy but what's interesting to me is look I'm I'm I'm into any theory of who Satoshi is I think it I think it is amazing that something like Bitcoin even happened it's straight out of a movie yeah tell me the story okay the the whole story is this 2008 really there's a white P the Bitcoin white paper gets released where some guy posts on a forum and posts in there that hey he thinks he solved the double spend problem which was a lot of people in the past had tried to make a virtual currency a digital gold there was eold there was hash cash there was all these different things that were tried and they all filled for different reasons so for example eold started to get really popular had like two billion dollars in volume but the guy who created it created it as a company it was a Founder a CEO of a company called eold and he lived in wherever Canada or something like that and as it hits two billion in transaction volume and and on the website it says this is a digital currency backed by actual gold and it says we'll be around you know today tomorrow and forever and actually instead knock knock government knocks on his door comes in raids them puts him in jail and so problem one with digital currencies was you can't be the guy behind it because as soon as this thing gets popular you have too much power and the nation states who who today control the currency Supply they're not going to like you or that or they're just going to do character attacks on you to discredit the currency okay so Satoshi solved that problem launching it under this pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto nobody knows who it is you know the anonymity of the whole thing and then he disappears okay uh so the second thing was uh other people tried to do it with hash cash and other things but to get the actual cryptography to work to get the currency to work you had to make sure that nobody could double spend the money right so like one of the reasons when you swipe your credit card today that transaction goes to a bank the bank says yes this person's got the money and that money's not already been spent it sends that message back to the register the register says approved that lets you go buy the thing right so the bank takes its 3% fee because it's verifying that yes this person has the money that this person's card is not doesn't appear to be stolen and that uh that money has not already been spent in another shop 10 minutes ago okay so uh what Bitcoin did was or what Satoshi did was he released his white paper saying I think I've solved that problem I think I've actually created a decentralized way to make money meaning money that can be trusted even though there's no Central party like a bank or a government that is verifying all the transactions okay so that's the Breakthrough that happens in 2008 they're discussing it 2009 the first Bitcoin block happen and did this person like actually code something you use the phrase white paper which uh it starts as a white paper which is just an explanation of a system it's an idea it's an idea written out like a business plan but the technical variant of it right here's the here's the technical plan of how we could create a currency that's decentralized di all right great uh but it's not coded yet then he codes it and by the way people when they've looked at the code they're like this is not done by like a super sophisticated programmer like there's things that when you look at the code you can sort of see the Elegance of it the the styling of it all that the level of technical proficiency and people when they when people look at that they don't think that it's done by somebody who's a super well a a a super senior programmer so they think either one of two things one it might be an academic type of person so somebody who technical enough but really it's the theory this the conceptual leap that was the big leap or that it might be somebody young they're like it works but it's just like the wires are messy exactly and by the way the the sort of sequence of events and I'm doing this off the top of my head so I might get some dates wrong so 2009 so after the 08 financial crisis which was like what people believe was the stimulus for why Satoshi felt this needed to happen because the banks got super greedy Leman Brothers fails and other Banks start to fail the US government steps in and buys $700 billion doll worth of bad debt uh basically bails out the banks prints more money tries to basically paper over the problems right and um so people who a want a currency that's like a hard currency meaning something that just can't you can't just print a whole bunch more and devalue my currency because some other people made mistakes they didn't like that U and in general this idea that it's too big to fail and the government controls it people didn't like that and you know that he feels this way because he's blogging every day it's written in the there's there's references to why there's a need for this in the white paper there's his Forum post and this is all happening on Message Board forums which Message Board Forum a originally it was just that um the sort of cryptographers like mailing list but then he created a forum of his own called Bitcoin talk so Satoshi creates Bitcoin talk his username is called Satoshi which is a very important point for how this guy thinks he found him in the end so on January 3rd the there's a message embedded in the first ever Bitcoin block which says the times 03 Jan 2009 Chancellor on the brink of second bailout for banks so in the very first block Satoshi who mined that block the Genesis block of the whole thing is basically putting in an IDE like a statement there which is chancers on the bank of on the the chancellor on the brink of a second bailout for the banks pointing out why we need something like this in the first place right is this this is so like um you know like in high school where you read literature and they want you to dive deep and they're like did you notice on uh you know page 200 uh he killed someone but you notice on page 50 he alluded to like he was going to do that like he said he loved red uh do you know what I mean like this is like what this is it definitely has big aim away message energy it definitely has uh when I'm in the bathroom and I Sean was here he is always here it's like what why what does he mean who was trying to get poetic in the bathroom stall like that was Satoshi on the first block all right so he posts there now let's fast forward a few years so they're and bitcoin's like at like you know one cent 30 cents it's like not a not like what Bitcoin is today at all anywhere close to it right and um but the the community is interested in it and they're talking about it and it exists now a couple fast forward a couple years something happens where Satoshi posts one day then the Wikileaks leak happens he Satoshi posts and says they've I'm afraid that this is they've kicked the Hornet's Nest and this is going to cause a lot of unwanted you know attention it's too young it's too young to deal with the government coming after us uh to try to shut this down because Wikileaks is saying oh we can use Bitcoin coin and the government hates Wikileaks therefore they're going to try to cut like choke Wikileaks by by killing the Bitcoin system so he didn't isn't that isn't that intoxicating thing you're just like Dorking around on a message board and you're and you're playing with concepts of like the government is after us or like this big national security threat is bad news for us because like you know what I mean it's like by the way there's references to this so early on when nobody like you know Bitcoin might have had I don't know 200 eyeballs it at the time like 200 people on Earth knew about Bitcoin but the foresight to say I'm going to be Satoshi I'm going to keep this all anonymized the second thing to say what there's there's people like halin who go in there and very early replies and like well if this actually became you know adopted as well you know the world's Reserve currency that would make every Bitcoin worth like you know $2 million doar or something like that it's like bitcoin's worth not even $1 yeah that's just like a ridiculous thing to type out exactly is is absolutely ridiculous but this is like sort of the the foresight the Visionary and by the way that that guy halny a lot of people think Hal is the Hal is a Toshi because the case for Hal is brilliant um you know cryptography mind he was the first recipient of Bitcoin so the first transaction was Satoshi sending to Hal which if you're a programmer it's like did you send to yourself that's a usually that's how programmers start things that might also be the case against because if this guy's kind of trying to cover his tracks he would definitely not send to himself as the first transaction right um and then Hal gets lugar's disease and dies and disappear basically he dies at the same time satoshi's last message is worth right so and and if the fact that this person has resisted the temptation to move to like either claim credit or touch their you know 700 billion dollar Fortune that's sitting there um not a single coin has ever been used from that that that uh Fortune maybe it's because the guy's dead right maybe that's the only way to explain somebody who has their the the resistance to it so that's which also is related which is also related to this current suspect's case yeah exactly so let's carry on so people think it's halny people think it might be this guy Adam back who who created hash cash and definitely traded emails early on with Satoshi and you know he runs block stream a company associated with Bitcoin so people don't know who it is they think it might be this this mysterious Asian guy way die he's like this brilliant cryptographer too nobody knows it there's no photos of this guy on the internet he claims so they're like maybe that's Satoshi people don't know all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appr appropriately we called it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode another person who like kind of came to the mix have you read the book about Paul laroo I think is the book it's called it's about it's called Mastermind and people I haven't read it but you you told me about oh my God intoxicating story and like he was thrown in the mix so there was like all these people who thrown thrown in the mix people think it's is it whoever and it's like okay we get sort of farfetched and that's sort of the fun of it by the way is like you know the the the mystery I genuinely think we are all better off not knowing okay so let let's continue on so the wikileak things the Wikileaks thing happens I think something like 2011 2012 uh Satoshi posts three days later he makes his last post so he posts Wikileaks happens two days later three days later last post disappears never to be heard from again okay so that's the the mystery kind of like sits there or actually I think did come back and post something in like 2014 2015 um and by the way he didn't disappear as in nobody heard from he at some point even said I'm going to move on I'm gonna stop talking about I'm gonna stop contributing to this like it's it's on its way and and I'm gonna move on I'm gonna stop talking about this so then in 2014 2015 there's a big debate in Bitcoin about like the transaction speeds too slow some people say hey we got to make the block size bigger that'll let more transactions go through some people say no no no you can't change something as fundamental as the block size we should do this this other more complicated thing that will take years but the reason we should do that is because if we change anything about the Bitcoin protocol it undermines it's like oh if you can change that then can't you change the 21 million Supply like you lose the core credibility there's two sides of this debate and on one side of the debate is this guy Roger ver who calls himself Bitcoin Jesus he made a huge bet on bitcoin early on millions of dollars and became a billionaire off of it and there's other people who are saying look we need to get this thing adopted now we need the quick and dirty solution just double the block size and shut up about all right you know people want to use this thing they can't use it today they got to we got to do the fast solution uh let's go go go they end up actually on the wrong side of History the community goes against them they create their own thing called Bitcoin cash kind of just thing that has low reputation the people who said no no we got to stay true to satoshi's Vision we're Adam back it's got Peter Todd and like you know a handful of others who said no no no the thing with Bitcoin is it's got to be pristine you can't it can't be where like the government government printing money we can't just suddenly arbitr change the rules it's like people who would have followed the Constitution which is like it's all like it's it's like a pretty funny thing that the constitution was just like a group of like 20 and 30y olds who like came up with this idea and now billions of people and 250 years have passed and we've all just kind of bought into this idea that this is the way things are and no matter how the world changes we're like we don't break it we don't change it because even if you think you could Second Amendment do we need that is that exactly right it's like once you change the Amendments now everything's up for grabs and so it's actually sort of better for the collective that way which is like a ridiculous concept to think about and and you could also say the same is true for like religion and like holy text where you're like someone wrote this and tens or hundreds of billions of people have dedicated their lives to it right like it is like that's a really fascinating concept but and that's what's happening or that is what you're referring to bitcoin is very much like your religion and the people who follow it are very like religious about it and so anyways he weighs in one last time there saying small block size is what we should do and it goes the way of Adam back Peter Todd and these other guys okay cool that's the last heard of sooshi and um they've tried to find him they don't know how to find him so this documentary yeah who's the guy documentary goes through and he basically under the premise of he goes to all the OG bitcoiners and he tells them I'm doing this documentary he doesn't tell them he's trying to find Satoshi what he tells them is more along the lines of I want to tell the Bitcoin story I don't know if he tells them it's going to be on HBO but like this is good for things so a lot of them agree to do this which is pretty rare for them to agree to sit down and do these like taped interviews and along the way as he's build make this documentary he's slipping in questions about Satoshi who is are you Satoshi why do people think that you are what's your claim to not be right hey people think that guy is do you think that what makes that credible so he's slipping and then the documentary is basically he kind of filters out 80 or 90% of their conversation probably and kept the 10% that was about like trying to figure out the Satoshi stuff okay so in the end he um he puts it on this guy Peter Todd and Peter Todd seems like an unlikely character for a bunch of reasons number one one when Bitcoin when the Bitcoin paper was released Peter Todd would have only been something like 23 years old he was like kind of like a kid number two he's he's come out and joked around like yeah I am Satoshi which like you know you the real Satoshi is probably pretty paranoid on the other hand some people say no the metag game would be you jokingly say that you are Satoshi to to throw suspicion off you right that sort of thing there's not a lot of evidence that ties him to this so they're like okay I guess it could be Peter Todd but like why not Hal the guy who got the first transaction why not ad him back who was one of the first people ever to talk to Satoshi and never has never has released those emails between him and Satoshi and was the inventor of hash cash like that guy seems more sophisticated to be able to do this uh why is it not a group why is it not the FBI like the case against him isn't he can't be it's more of why him there's so many other more likely people and again the biggest case against him is he was really young and um that he uh he kind of and jokes around with this and he's also very opinioned about other things um so like he's very opinionate about like Russia and Ukraine like a whole bunch of [ __ ] like that and so people don't like him in general he's not a very well-liked figure so it kind of doesn't jive with the Bitcoin community that this is our fearless leader it's like wait we kind of think this guy's kind of a prick because Satoshi kind of has this uh stoic mentality this um writing that is like us versus the world like a very much like Visionary attitude and and you're describing someone that may not have have like uh George Washington Vibes you know well look the funniest tweet I saw on this cuz I was trying to see the community's reaction the funniest tweet that I think is underratedly how people will feel about this the guy goes Peter Todd this it goes Peter Todd that's the most average ass name I've ever heard this guy this guy looks like the most average ass guy I've ever seen I'm looking at him guy disappointed like if that was Satoshi I would be disappointed right like oh it's just this guy is this this white dude who like you know has all these like other opinions that I kind of disagree with like that kind of the veneer of Satoshi goes away so where whereas if you Google how finny he he looks like a person that just studies all day yeah how was this beloved guy then he dies tragically and it's sort of like he he went down with the ship the captain went down with the ship he never revealed and the other thing about HAL is he cryogenically froze his head and so like if a thousand years from now cryonics are a thing and you can unfreeze they're like he's got the private key in his head and he'll come out as satosi like whatever okay so it's kind of like that has that sort of Aura okay now let me give you the evidence why does this documentary guy claim that it's Peter totd okay so that the evidence is basically this back right when that thing happened remember I said there was a post the Wikileaks things happened and he disappeared everybody thinks that it's because of the Wikileaks thing that he got paranoid and he decided to bounce there was one other thing that happened after that post that first post that was not to do with Wikileaks at all that thing that happened was Satoshi posted about how the transaction like mechanism works and then the first reply underneath an hour and a half later is from Peter Todd but it looks like a continuation of the thought so he says in the original post he says you know the inputs and the outputs would match and then he and then the Peter Todd reply comes in it just says to be specific the inputs and the outputs wouldn't exactly match it would be whatever now some people would say that's just a snarky internet Forum like kind of rude comment like you didn't even there's no formality there's no like there's no there's no uh understanding you're just like immediately trying to like correct something from somebody's post that happens all the time on the internet another lens you could look at that same thing is Satoshi writes this thing comes back to clarify forgets to switch back to his alt account and that post has been up there and it's been left up there for a very long time so the guy the documentary guy is reading that he's like dude are we dumb have we missed this doesn't this look like it's a continuation of the thought it's a clarification of the thought and for this guy who's claims to have not been interested in Bitcoin until years later and claims to be have been busy in school for him to come in at 130 in the morning and make a super specific clarification as to how the Bitcoin mechanism works that doesn't really line up with this guy who wasn't interested and didn't follow it and was just a kid at the time right by the way this is how they caught Ross sber the creator of Silk Road he just he he posted on a forum with logged into the wrong username or he left his email like like it was like a a clerical err by the way this is how they got Timothy McVey from Oklahoma City Bombing he uh one of his tail lights was out like there's like lots of examples of Big Shot criminals being busted over minor things of just and but you know uh this is and but in the right now on Twitter people are saying you think Satoshi who's been like Flawless with his opsc in security of how he did this you think he would just stupidly log into the wrong account and leave the message there and it's like yeah actually that happened all the time that's actually a pretty common pattern in fact if I said what's the most likely way we find him it's either that or like you know uh maybe the email he registered his Satoshi email with gets leaked some some other way it's like it fits a stereotype of like when you think of like the brilliant scientists you think of Albert Einstein with like mismatch socks uh you know what I mean like this is like this is the internet equivalent of that so that's the first piece then um then there's like some other there's like a few secondary things so there's like the language like he writes like calor with o Ur he writes like in the Canadian English spelling this guy was going to school in Toronto at the time but a lot of people are like you know is this guy brilliant as Satoshi you know is he he was so young at the time is this even possible and then they go find a message from him on the uh on the cryptography forums before Bitcoin ever came out eight years prior to when Bitcoin came out so how old was he at that point he's 15 or 16 years old at the time and he writes he's s he's hanging out in this you know Cipher punk you know community and he's um he basically says at on the Forum and he's like he's like yeah hash cash blah blah blah it had that and then he's talking about the mechanism he's like it would have to be something more than proof of work blah blah blah effing double spend problem and that's like the like the snippet from this email chain that he he posted back then which is like okay so you're 15 16 years old you're obviously brilliant and not just like you know some random programmer kid and you're thinking and noodling about this problem eight years prior his mom taught him about c phography his dad was an economist so it's like the two skills you would need to be Satoshi is like You' need the Brilliance on the encryption and cryptography side and you would need the ethos and the sort of ideology on um you know creating you know what is a currency anyways what is money what is hard money and how does how does the world Economics work um that's his this this kid's background so how old is he now by the way mid to late 30s is is his age now and he works for blockstream and he's like very close to that guy Adam back and Adam would have been the you know the people that he would collaborate with after after creating this now the the most damning thing is so he the documentary confronts him on like live and by the way imagine being 39 and having this documentary come out about you uh like accusing you of being the richest person in the world accusing you of inventing this amazing thing like there's one part of there's one side of you that's like oh man I want all the credit I want I want all this and then the other part but but then you're like well if I'm not it but should I say I'm it should I be it there's also a very irresponsible part of this let's say this documentary is wrong I mean you just painted it you just ruined a guy's life basically like uh if people believe that you're Satoshi your life immediately is in danger people think that you're one of the wealthiest people on Earth every a government agency every government you know uh wants to to sort of take you to the back room and talk to you and and and sometimes worse right so like if he is Satoshi I think it's a very bad thing for him I almost feel bad bringing it up but I think we you know we got to talk about you know I needed to hear your reaction to this um and obviously it's out I'm not the one you know putting this out there it's out now so so just watch this video and tell me what you think all right so you reach out to your old buddy Adam back you say we need to do something about this but we need to pay the devs but you can't join blog stream because it would look too uh suspicious okay so I just watched this clip first of all this is definitely editorial like you know very opinionated versus factual right this guy so so basically it's a tall nerdy guy with his hands in his pockets and he's doing exactly what I am accused of doing all the time when I'm nervous which is I rock back and forth fidget I Shi Shifty eyes look at immediately look at the friend who you're in on it with who by the way that guy Adam in the back who's his friend um who who's the other kind of like co- collaborator on this thing silent the entire time like frozen because the director sort of sprung this they didn't come out here to talk about that right they're they're doing this walk through this like ruins area or whatever supposed to be talking about whatever and the director sort of does a gotcha moment and this is their reaction dude all right so he's got his hands in his pocket and he's rocking back and forth I had to um officiate a wedding last week and Sarah was like I could tell you were nervous no one else knew you're nervous I knew you're nervous and I was like how she goes you were rocking bath back and forth you kept you kept doing that thing where you rock back and forth and I do it all the time this guy's doing that exact same thing he's very clearly uncomfortable and he's got a very awkward smile uh this is this is It's a yeah he didn't respond well but you could also say like you could just chalk that up to every bitcoiner like they're just dor a social situ they can't make eye contact like that's why they're amazing like you can't be this and also have good eye contact that you can't you can't have both uh so what do you think is did he is this the guy so I don't know if this is the guy or not but it is probably the mo it's one of the most compelling things and it it's it's funny it's being so discredited by the community so either I'm missing something uh which is entirely possible or it's sort of wishful thinking because like it's much better if he's not uh Satoshi and uh and I don't think the evidence is super super strong but it's a very compelling Theory that's kind of where I've landed it's a compelling Theory this guy who clearly at 15 or 16 was brilliant and thinking specifically about the double spend problem and then talks and then comes out and then has this this forum post which is the timing is very interesting about right when it happens the way it's written and then the guy disappears and then by the way this guy also disappeared for two years after that in the Bitcoin form doesn't participate and he's like oh I was busy I was a student blah blah blah I should have been more interested in Bitcoin I just wasn't and then when he comes back he actually does this thing called uh replace by fee which is basically this mechanism where you could pay a little extra to get your transaction done faster and actually is like one of the useful patches to bitcoin so he comes back and contributes this useful patch to the Bitcoin code afterwards and in this thing he's like his nervous answer is basically like what me oh yeah yeah I'm totally sty I mean that's crazy why why are you saying that you know you're going to look really stupid if you release this and it's like those are things I do when I'm trapped in a li maybe I'm projecting here do you alluded to something about the name Satoshi uh Nakamoto is that did he imply something earlier in his career before Satoshi existed that he liked that name or was tied to that name there was no uh no there's no evidence on that the the evidence was basically the combination of evidence was that Forum post the timing of both of their disappearances it's him you know when he's 15 16 years old uh on the forums it's his kind of like the his spelling and kind of his writing style even the way he kind of like uh punctuates where it's like the two two spaces after the period the O things that are a lot of people do but they all they don't they do fit with this guy did halny uh write like Satoshi no um they've looked at like Hal's code and then satoshi's code but then you know there's an answer for everything oh he's so brilliant he knew to modify the code into a different style right there's an answer for everything it's a like all conspiracies it's it's sort of what you choose to believe or what you choose to not believe that's pretty hard like I I actually think that that that that like I because when I used to actually write in fake names like fake blog posts all the time and I remember trying to change how I was writing and I remember doing that and thinking this is really challenging everyone's going to know this is me uh I used to write fake blog like I had like pseudonyms that I would just like fill my blog with uh and so that's like a pretty compelling actually piece of evidence if you ask me yeah like I want to be super clear I don't know the answer I'm not saying I believe this or I don't believe this I'm saying this is the most interesting theory on this is the most interesting new theory on Satoshi right so there's been over the years there's been many theories including the time when like I forgot like the New Yorker or New York Post or something like chased down that Rand animation guy and was like it's Tim Dorian Nakamoto this is the guy and he's like what he's like didn't know where he was and basically like had his life ruined for like 48 Hours um you know there's a there's been many theories over the years this might be just another hairbrain Theory but I would say it's the most interesting one in a few years to me and as somebody who I'm just fascinated by the story I badly want to know but I also I understand that it would be much better to never know uh for all of us uh to never know and for whoever it is you know like I think they had a great contribution to the world and you know their wish was to be anonymous I think that should be uh you know respected and I think you whoever is Satoshi is in extreme danger once they once it does get outed if it ever does get outed in terms of like the Olympics or the Hall of Fame of stories like JFK is like up in there the JFK assassination who did it and I think actually this story is on par with that do you know what I mean yeah exactly like the most you use the word intoxicating it's like these rabbit holes that like just kind of make you wonder and you can't you keep going back to them you know aliens the certain assassinations and then there's there's there's this one this like it kind of keeps me up at night to be honest and I don't even give a [ __ ] about Bitcoin but I think that it's just like I think that what it's rooted in um potentially how one person um had such an impact and was so brilliant I think that if you read uh American Kingpin about Ross alri Ross had the same exact style where it was very romantic IC it was very uh I want to get behind you like it's US versus the world like we we are on a path to Greatness like this whole that whole concept was Ross had the exact same thing and even though he did a lot of really bad stuff you kind of want to get behind it because you're like yeah that's just like that's just the price that we PID to be James Bond like we kill bad guys uh and so like this except Ross might have been a bad guy he might have been the bad guy in this gamee well he he was like like he did a lot I I think that like you could do good things and bad things but I think think he actually did I I think that he should be in jail for a long period of time because he tried to kill more Breaking Bad where you you're rooting for Walt even though you're like wait I think this guy's now a drug kingpen who's killing people but uh yeah or Tony Soprano love this guy like it's like Tony Soprano like you want to like Tony but then you're like dude you suck like you're a bad husband and you kill people like like just cuz you're funny doesn't mean I should like you're an amazing person by way can I can I make a one minute Bitcoin case right now are you back I mean am I back I've been here no you haven't been here you you haven't been here your interest has ebed and flowed from the topic the conviction hasn't e and flows it's like how much new information is there to pay attention to it's in the same way but like I'm not like oh my God the internet is amazing like yeah I kind of know the internet's amazing I made that decision a long time ago and I just used it you know like I just I'm in I'm I've been in I'm in right like versus when it first came out it's like every new thing is is new it was a very excited it was a very exciting period but yeah what's your one minute I mean the one minute is this from the beginning with Bitcoin there's always been these like the big risks the big question marks so once you once you sort of accept that there's Merit to having a hard currency meaning having a currency that doesn't get inflated the way I look at it is bitcoin's a savings technology so people use people think bitcoin's gonna make them Rich actually the the true purpose of Bitcoin is a store value meaning it's it's meant to keep you rich so I don't know if you ever seen the charts of like you know your you know if if your great grandparent or whatever hundred years ago had left you you know a million dollar Fortune it would be worth you know only 3% of what they left right it' be worth 30 grand today and so just in 100 years uh 100 years in the United States at the targeted inflation or the actual inflation uh your money is going to uh be cut in half sort of every 30 years yeah if you left it in Cash correct correct yeah the currency itself I'm saying like if you just said I I feel safer just with with the you good old US dollar in the bank account you it's a bowl of ice cream that's melting by Design because uh on average roughly 3% a year it gets devalued so a and that's not a conspiracy theory that is the target inflation is 2 or 3% sometimes it's higher like it's been but like the goal for them is to inflate it two or 3% a year mean which means by Design two or 3% a year means that in 30 years you're gonna have whatever half of what you so one generation um okay so the if you once you believe that there's Merit to just like well I'd rather save it's like I'd rather have a phone whose battery doesn't drain I'd rather save my money in a currency that is not designed to inflate and you might say well there's still a leap of faith which is will this be a thing currency only matters if a bunch of people believe in it whatever that's that's that's the only question mark That's the r the is Bitcoin even a currency of course I mean is a c is the definition of a currency uh liquidity is it is it or not liquidity uh the ability to the like uh a lot of people spending it a better way of saying it is it's money so it's a money asset money has three jobs store value number one meaning um I have to believe that if I go out and I work hard every day and I get paid in this thing that this thing is going to be valuable tomorrow or the next day yeah it requires a collective buyin correct and that's the first stage then after after it's already accepted by many people as valuable like the way gold is accepted by many people as valuable then it can be used as a medium of exchange meaning then I'm willing to trade it back and forth with people because I know they believe it's valuable I believe it's valuable they're going to believe it's going to be valuable they know that the next guy they want to spend with think be valuable so once we all buy into it's valuable then it's usable after that as a medium Mo exchange that part hasn't happened yet and then the final stage is once we're all using as a medium exchange we price things in it that's called the unit of account so those are the three phases of something becoming yeah a true you know useful currency today Bitcoin is like basically it's completing stage one where the bulk of the world the majority has flipped to believe that Bitcoin is valuable okay uh you could see that in the price $60,000 you could see that in who owns it individual you know wealthy wealthy folks how many human beings own one Bitcoin or own uh some Bitcoin I don't know the number of like active wallets now and the hard part is one person can have multiple wallets but it's like over 100 million for sure it's like in the hundreds of millions of people okay well then I think it's a stretch to say bought into the system it's a stretch to say everyone agrees that it's uh what I mean is obviously not everybody so not eight billion people on Earth own this8 billion people also don't own dollars right that that's not that's also not the case um but for hundreds of millions of people to have active like have wallets with value in them is okay big that's I mean that's that's that's a humongous number so anyways that's how the currency works so the the the case for Bitcoin right now is over time there's always been two big risks so the first risk is the government's just going to shut this down right the the the the smart guy case was look you might be right that this is better than gold you might be right that it's more secure than gold it's easier to transport than gold that it's uh it's the more programmable money like I get all that but look the government's not going to go down without a fight their biggest strangle hold on power is that they own the guns and the money you can't take one of their two big Powers away right you you might they'll still have the guns but if they if you they lose their ability to control the money supply no government's goingon to allow that and for a while it looked like that China tried to ban it India tried to ban it uh but Bitcoin was pretty resilient and now you have in this election for example both of the candidates are pro crypto Donald Trump is very Pro crypto and K is now realized she it is now political Su to be an which is insane it's in CRA it's crazy they're both on the circuit that's wild right Don speaking at the Bitcoin conference kamla stopped saying she's GNA kill crypto well dude I talked to our uh we have a mutual friend who owns a uh uh a crypto related media business and he was like all these politicians want to talk to me now it's insane because they want to speak at our events they want to do all this stuff they need us now they they want to participate they want to be part of the conversation and I that's insane to me that I mean a in a good way I think but that's like wild that these people want that I mean Trump has literally said in very Trump fashion maybe maybe we'll maybe we'll do Bitcoins and that'll pay the debt right he's like maybe we'll just buy some Bitcoins and that'll pay everything off the government is now proc crypto they've now realized it is political suicide to be anti-crypto because there's too many Americans who have wealth and if you say we're going to either block this or ban this or confiscate this that means something to too many Americans so now you can't politically be uh in a we're gonna shut down or kill crypto killit Bitcoin specifically and so that's that's a huge thing that changed from like five eight years ago and I feel like nobody's really giving that nobody's pricing that in properly nobody's giving that enough credit that like one of the biggest risks that the US government is never going to go for this and now they're Pro crypto that's that's crazy uh the second thing is you know there's all these clips of Jamie Diamond and black rock and all these people just [ __ ] on bitcoin and calling it you know the dumbest thing you're idiots if you want to go lose your money go do this and now they're the biggest custodians and the biggest salesmen of of of Bitcoin dude aren't they so full of [ __ ] man like it's just funny how I guess I mean everyone deserves the right to change their opinion once they get gather new information but there it really the consequences are very big so here's the consequences of that right like a week ago Black Rock released this presentation that they're giving about why Bitcoin is better than gold and it's literally the same slides that the like crypto anarchists were using 10 years ago it's like here's Bitcoin compared to gold gold you can't trans you can't carry it easily you can't easily divide it Gold's not actually that scarce we can always find more bitcoin's actually a fixed Supply and so like all of the old the old arguments they're now on a road show to wealthy people and to financial advisers so they're basically training financial advisers and their clients that a healthy portfolio has one to 5% Bitcoin in it so they're recommending it as now like the smart move the wise move to do um and so they're on a road show because they make a bunch of money they're incentivized to do this because they make a bunch of money right it's the fastest growing ETF product in the world uh is Bitcoin I think the Bitcoin ETFs are now like some insane uh number like what and why why do you need a Bitcoin ETF so the Bitcoin ETF is the know one of the other big counterpoints was this is too complicated my mom my dad is Never Gonna Go download a wallet off this thing and figure out their private key and they're going to be afraid to lose it okay coinbase that's easier but like by they don't open up new accounts they just invest out their 401k or whatever so the reason an ETF matters is now everybody who's got an account with whoever it is Morgan Stanley or um you know Fidelity or Nationwide whoever so funny I just Googled crypto ETF or Bitcoin ETF and there's a website for Fidelity it just says it's it's it's a ad that Fidelity is running to get me to click on and it's about their Crypton on a Fidelity look like life insurance so funny so like a loving family like hugging and embracing be like our future isure [ __ ] like that is like Walmart buying the Supreme brand like dude come on this is La everybody is incentivized to do it meaning the presidents are like yo if we're proc crypto we unlock crypto donation dollars and this voting block so they're like all right politically we're now incentivized to do this black Rock's like yo how much money can be made with this right there's 60 the the the ETF has had like 61 billion dollar put into management like in the last you know it's only been legal for like six months it's pretty lame though right they get a 1% fee of doing it then they sell this as a product as an upsell to people now anybody in their retirement accounts in their stock Trader accounts can push one button and own Bitcoin without ever having to deal with custodian issues or the private keys or your wallet or losing your hard drive or any of that [ __ ] and so yes it's lame because it's not cool anymore meaning it's not cool and edgy and ALT um but the whole point was like it goes through this adoption phase right and now it's going more mainstream so I think what's my point is I cannot believe as somebody who's been watching this thing for like probably at this point literally 10 or 11 years it was unfathomable 10 years ago to be like not only will Bitcoin be $60,000 a coin that would have already blown my mind 10 years ago but on top of that the presidents are going to be using this in their campaign they're going to say this is a good idea they're going to talk talk about you know having a little bit of on the nation's balance sheet corporations are going to own this thing um Black Rock and Larry Fink and Jamie Diamond they're that's gonna be their hero product it's their hero skew now and that you're just going to be able click a button and buy it as a as a ETF like all of that is unbelievable to me and and I feel like people really have not grasped how once you do that you can't unwind it so once everybody owns it in in their ETFs or their retirement accounts what are they going to do you can't it's too embedded in the system at that point you can't like you can't rip it out its tentacles are too deep dude listen to this so I um this is kind of like indicative of where Bitcoin was going it's kind of silly I uh this is to The Listener I've mentioned I moved to a small town outside of New York City in Connecticut and my town is very much what you would picture of Connecticut like the other day I went to like this fancy Ralph the rent store and they're like where do you live and they were like and I was like I live where these clothes were designed to be worn like where there's like literally Polo Fields in like my like in my hood and there's a Rowing Club uh next to my house like you're on thei I guess it's a river and you're like rowing like crew which growing in Missouri that's like the richest kid like yepy [ __ ] ever right but I was interested in it and I and I go to this Rowing Club to like see if I could like sign up for lessons and I see a Bitcoin book in the lobby of a row Club so a row Club is basically just imagine a gym but instead of like just weights there's like areas to row whatever and I see a Bitcoin book and I was like wait what the hell why is this Bitcoin book here and then I start walking around and I see a case full of trophies of high school people who have graduated from the uh this row Club but did well in high school and won championships whatever and there's a picture of these two guys who are 18 and they're huge strapping looking dudes and I'm like like you got to be kidding me who why do you have a picture of the winkl Voss twins here and they go oh uh their father owns this place and when they were young and they were into rowing he built this row Club so they could kind of have a place to go to and uh and I was like that's why you have the Bitcoin book they go yeah they like I I don't remember if they wrote the book or if it was written about them and you know their the father's proud so he just has like their book in the lobby and I was like that is so funny and so this Rog Club is founded by the winko Voss father wink whatever and uh it's doesn't it seem like they would totally call their dad father oh yeah yeah for sure I'm gonna demand that my kids call me Father uh because I feel like that's just like already like 25 Prestige points in life dude I tell my um little daughter whenever we FaceTime Grandma I go that there's your grandmother yeah that's wild that's so funny you you live the most preppy life now yeah you know what um embrace it's kind of fun if I'm being honest uh it's kind of fun uh so I enjoy it um but dude this Bitcoin stuff I I've I wouldn't say I'm I'm not exactly a hater of it but I love like poking holes in it because I think that's just a fun position to have uh W with this whole conversation but for this podcast I want it to be back I had so much fun hearing these stories I think it's like the stories and the drama regarding this whole community and this thing thing is so cool like alltime great like just some dork invented this [ __ ] some nerd in called the cyberpunk invented this thing and now Fidelity is like you know however many tens of thousands employees and like the most amount of money in the world is all like ring around this I think that is such a an exciting story there's yet to be a great movie uh around this and I think it's too hard of a story to tell there needs to be like only a couple story lines for this movie but I'm really excited for something like that and frankly I want to go and read more books on the topic because every book I've read about Bitcoin has been thrilling yeah yeah well it depends if you want the thriller or you want the theory right there's like no no I don't I don't want that no I just want like tell me about someone who like died or just sex death and War like uh you know like rebel Rebels doing [ __ ] that's what I want okay fair enough fair enough then you might like this documentary I don't know we'll see actually the best the best one of that is there's a documentary about this this business called quadriga did you ever watch this one no what's that it's the best um murder mystery crazy like just insane batshit crazy scammy like uh movie about crypto oh is this the guy who died trust no one the guy died in India and they're like dude you faked your death and like the Indian doctor uh we already talked about it the Indian doctor um faked the autopsy well they don't know that's that's a theory right so yeah it's called trust no one the hunt for the crypto King uh that's probably the most like Thriller version of a crypto movie that I've seen dude I just watched this one about these kids from Long Island who like moved to Miami and they came up with like some Ico uh scam and they document this guy as he's telling his story but coincidentally he's also still on trial so you get to see him like going through trial and then eventually getting acquitted and we talked about this particular guy we like he was posting pictures of like his abs and his Ferrari on his Instagram and we're like dude if you have abs and perfect teeth and you're also in the crypto Community you can't be trusted and like Floyd Mayweather and a bunch of these guys like backed his [ __ ] and we're like this is this is a complete scam but he still walked away with potentially tens of millions of dollars and got away with it he didn't go to prison um and so did you see that one I didn't see that one no the the the kind of the Ico uh you know kids with Lambos version of it I just hate them so much that it's such a turn off I can't I can't bring myself turn but when it's like this kind of ideologic I Rebel person who you know like more like like I need kind of like a maybe evil maybe genius it's hard to say is he just misunderstood or actually is he just playing all of us like that's really kind of the sweet spot for me with the crypto uh crime stuff like crypto could basically have its own true crime like Index right because there's been so many so many issues I don't like the like 18-year-old like Tik Tock uh Tik Tok nft that's just a straight scam and and and and that story is so easy there's no art to that yeah there's no yeah like the s b free thing is is so interesting because not only is he like an enigma and like it it's like he looks the part but then he doesn't then he he did something crazy but it's unclear why he did it because he actually had a business that would have made him a billionaire many times over that was like the scam with FTX wasn't that the demand and the customers were fake the demand and the customers were real it's just that he took the customer money and gambled on it you know used it for crazy donations to build power and uh to put in his hedge fund to like run up the run up the balance on that side it was just an unnecessary risk and so the the fascinating thing about that one is like why why did this guy even do that he didn't need to do that he won he had the real win and he snatched defeat from the jaws of victory in that case how about um if I told you three years ago when SPF was still we still thought he was legit him and Diddy are uh in prison together like isn't that the craziest turn of events it's really insane like Diddy and SPF or like have I ever told the the the SPF uh FTX story with milk Road what happened how they advertised with you and they were late to pay no no no they weren't late to pay they um we used to do something called Deep Dives which is basically like if one of our like sort of AD products was if you pay us a ton of money we will do a report on you but the catch was we're going to do the report we actually want to do like you don't get to say what we say in the report and with FTX it was like a no- brainer they're like the richest player and there was a bunch of good things to say so it seemed like it was gonna be a win-win and so they they do the they pay us a bunch of money or they they told us they're gonna pay us a bunch of money and then we go write the report and it in the report you know I'm trying to this was I think I was writing it myself or me and Ben were writing I don't remember exactly what the case was um but I was involved with it and I remember we were thinking about okay like what's the Devil's Advocate like doesn't smell right about this because you have to have the Counterpoint and not even just a rip on them but having a Counterpoint makes acknowledging the Counterpoint honestly makes the point stronger so even if we were trying to say like a positive thing which was that they were super fast growing and they had this really like you know aggressive marketing strategy that was working like all that [ __ ] um we're like what's the Counterpoint and the Counterpoint was like the guy we had met who was like the chief security officer he was like 24 years old or not security a chief strategy officer who's 24 years old and we're like wow that's so impressive like how did this kid become like Chief strategy officer of this like at that time it's like a 20 billion doll company oh yeah where the story is going and so we were we were like yeah actually like a lot of the the like exacts are kind of like young just like the friends but okay Facebook looked that way too early on you know okay interesting maybe a good thing maybe a bad thing and then we were like yeah it's unclear the like connection between Alam they like hedge fund and FTX and so we wrote that in there we were like one thing that that's not clear is like what is the relationship between these two parties and where's there is there a firewall and there's some speculation that like you know it wasn't that alme was just like the FDX was just siphoning the money and giving it to Alam and Alam was gambling it and losing it it was that Alam had you know like Insider info and they were front running that's kind of what what people thought so we wrote that in there like hey we need you to take that out we're like no we're not gonna take that out and they're like uh okay then just uh hold on this and we're like cool but you paid us already so you know do you want to ever run this and then they just never replied again and we were like okay they I think they paid us like half of the amount and so I remember them just be like checking in every few months like hey do what like are you ready for us to release this yet or no and they're like no and we're like okay didn't think too much of it moved on with our life and then sure enough that hey this connection is sort of unclear and you know there's some potential issues that turned out to be like it's like oh no that's stage four that turned out to be a very big problem actually and isbf like in prison how how's he holding up is he still eating just peanut butter and that his whole thing that like he only consumes peanut butter in prison because he's to 25 years but I do think there was like there was I think he sented in 25 years but I don't I don't think he's going to serve that whole time I don't know how that the whole system works well no if you if you get for federal crimes um you know a lot of like the a lot of people say like oh you got sentenced 20 you're only going to do 10 well for federal crimes I think the max amount it can ever get reduced is 10 or 15% I maybe 10% so if you get sentenced to 20 you're ser 18 something like that it's like a [ __ ] huge deal like it's like yeah this is not like a and I think the prison he's at is like a it's it's it's big boy prison like this is not uh like particularly a fun thing uh right like there's this like idea of like a white collar I I talked to I know a guy or a guy whose uncle got sentenced to a white collar crime and he served 18 years and he was like uh he he told me he would visit his uncle and he was like yeah I mean it was when you say the word white collar crime you kind of think like it's cushy and like it was kind of that but like it's prison like bad and bad stuff would happen and like you're confined all all the time like it's it's it's really bad and I don't think SPF is is in that type of like prison anyway he's in like a real prison right like a prison where built for that yeah do you have you ever watched this show the night of no what's that oh dude amazing show I think it's on Showtime or HBO uh the night of it's it's just an awesome show and one of the things that I really liked about it is they showed almost like they showed the actual legal system at work and it's almost like painful to watch the whole legal and prison system as the story plays out but they don't fast forward the way a lot of movies and shows do is they kind of fast forward it's like there's the crime and then there's like the courtroom where it's like one lawyer is giving one dramatic speech and the other lawyer is giving another dramatic speech whereas this one it actually shows like the real do a holy field of of well we have the uh the first first hearing okay the appeal is going to be in three months and he's back to jail for 3 months and he's waiting waiting waiting and just going through it and it's just extremely wellmade an awesome show to watch dud it takes forever the stuff takes forever which like kind of boggles my mind a little bit about why and then and then you could push things for a long time so you remember Elizabeth Holmes when she got in trouble I think it was like many years after the actual stuff went down that the tri she went on maternity leave from prison remember she started babies and she just had two babies back to back and kept pushing it off that's what happens when you wear Ralph Len and look like you live in Connecticut you could take maternity leave from uh from prison I think that's one of the perks she took advantage of that privilege um we didn't mean to make this the Bitcoin episode but uh an hour has flown by once you said the magic word I was in so I'm happy that that it became that to be honest all right that's it that's a p [Music]

well I have a different billionaire story that's kind of crazy I wanted to tell you about so what check this out this is this is a wild story I'm just going to embrace [Music] yourself okay let's start with this I'm going to read you a snippet from an article first so in July in early 2022 the courts ruled that this person Mike Lynch owed 4 B ion in Damages that are still pending okay so court rules that Mike Lynch owes $4 billion next line at the same time the US tried to extradite Lynch he was in the UK the US says no no no we're going to come try you over here they bring him over and he arrives in San Francisco in May of 2023 and he's released on aund million bail and consigned to house arrest in a rental home with cameras installed in every room two armed guards on duty on duty around the clock now what's interesting about this is that that rental home with cameras assult in every room and armed guards on duty Around the Clock is my dad's house I don't know if you know this that guy stayed at my dad's Airbnb when he was on trial your dad owns an air like a home in my dad's actual house he'll Airbnb out for periods of time he'll go if he gets booking that's like you at the right price point he'll go get to he'll go to like a motel at a hotel like in you know Fremont or something like that go stay there for the night and then he'll be like so happy that he made some money but my dad didn't know this he gets a booking man this guy wants uh this guy just booked three months and three months by the way is the max you can even do when you're airb be in your own house in San Francisco it's like that you have 90 days so he's like wow I got the whole year from one guy this is great so he's like where am I gonna go for three months and he's figuring it out I'll go travel whatever and then he texts me and he's like hey can you check the ring camera real quick and I check the ring and there's these bodyguards standing outside the house what what's going on and so he texts the guy and he's like hey Mike hope you got into the house okay from the lock box curious what are these guards doing outside the house and he says oh I'm actually on house arrest I'm awaiting my trial and for the duration of this I can't leave the house you know that's why I wanted your Airbnb you have this nice backyard hard to get a nice backyard in San Francisco so and my dad's like what the hell so he starts Googling the case we all start googling the case and this guy's story is fascinating and is this for autonomy yeah so I'll give you the end of the story which is which is kind of interesting right I don't know if you have you heard the latest update on this no but not the latest but I know that it's weird there's a lot of weird stuff going on so I'll I'll start with the end then we'll go back to the beginning the end of the story is at some point my dad's like hey I got to go back to live in my house your trial's not over the guy's like okay okay I'll ask the judge if I can move Airbnb so he moves airbnbs he finishes the trial he's acquitted on all charges he's a free man to celebrate him his family his lawyers they all get on a yacht he owns this $30 million yacht and this person that he used to work with a guy who was his character witness his lawyer his wife the lawyer's wife they all get on this boat and they start sailing and mysteriously two months after uh being acquitted of all charges there's a freak yacht accident and he dies he's killed on this boat at the same time 48 hours later the other guy in the case his co-founder who was also quitted on the same day of all the charges is going for a run and gets hit by a car and also dies and so it's kind of strange that this guy who was in this multi-billion dollar fraud suit the day you know 48 Hours um apart just a couple months after being acquitted him and the co-founder both killed in freak accidents yeah all right so now let's go back to the beginning I googled this guy so this guy's story is actually pretty fascinating he is called the British Bill Gates and the reason he's called the British Bill Gates is that this guy was brilliant so he grew up super poor basically he's uh he's so poor but he's uh he's a hard worker he's smart and he ends up getting a scholarship to go to school because he and he said this he goes there was a guy like a a lord in the 1600s who when he died he left his wealth specifically one purpose for the education of poor boys and he's like I'm I was a poor boy and I got to have the scholarship which let me go to a school and so when he's 11 he gets into a private school he starts working really hard at 6 he becomes a janitor at a hospital and he's mopping the floors and during the trial he's talking about his his childhood or growing up and they he's like at 16 I used to work in this Hospital mopping the floors I was I was and actually I still am I'm a demon mopper so I could do that and the lawyer goes your credibility is on the line here Dr Lynch and he goes throw me a mop I'll show you right now and the whole uh audience at the at the courthouse starts laughing he tells a story at the at the hospital he's working his way up so he goes from janitor mopping the floors to Porter which he's he's Wheeling the people from room to room he's moving the beds around finally he gets the prestigious job of serving tea and sandwiches and he says this most important thing that happened in my life was at age 16 I spent a lot of time with people who were 95 year old basically people on the way out and I used to sit with them and I used to serve them tea and sandwiches and these people had nobody to talk to and they at the end of their life and they opened up to me about their life and about things that they've never told anybody and he goes at 16 I thought that life is I mean destructible and life you know life seems like it's forever when you're 16 he's like every day I was reminded life is really short I want to really make something of my life then he says I get he gets into Cambridge he goes into Cambridge and he gets a PhD um in neural networks a artificial intelligence and neural networks and this is he's this is this is way before AI n networks were a thing so let's fast forward he starts this company called autonomy and autonomy was basically like one of these like machine learning Big Data take take a bunch of data find patterns that the human eye is not going to be able to see and they sell this to both companies as well as governments and agencies sort of like a paler esque company so he um starts this company he ends up selling it to HP for 11 billion do so H Packard who's like a hardware company wants to go to software and they get really hot and heavy and they the company was already public but they offered a 60% premium so they said we'll give you 60% more than your stock price to take this deal he says all right you know he's like if I had not taken that deal my shareholders would have been you know it would have sounded like a herd of elephants stampeding towards me why didn't you take this deal so of course I took the deal it takes the deal a couple years later HP ends up writing off eight eight and a half billion dollars of that acquisition and they say you guys cook the books so you um you inflated your revenues your profits your balance sheet um so they sue him and in the suit there a couple things happened the the CFO pleads guilty for wire fraud so he's in jail for I don't know five seven years something like that um they the co-founder volunteers to work with them and he gets a pretty light sentence and this guy Mike avoids he tries to avoid being in court with these guys so he's trying to avoid extradition all this stuff for like a period of time finally they get him and what's like the what's the he says she says like uh so HP says your Revenue wasn't what what it really was or you build people wrong what what's it's a very complicated thing so they said that hey you misrepresented your revenues and the profitability profile of this business and something on the balance sheet He Said She Said So during the court case they asked him about this and he says if you take a microscope into any kitchen even the cleanest ones you will find bacteria okay which is great analogy but the most guilty [ __ ] I've ever heard so that sounds horrible so I don't know all the details at at during the court case they had 15 million financial documents that they had submitted as exhibits and it was so complicated that during this case one juror kept falling asleep and the lawyer looks over at him and he goes I know this is not fascinating but you got to tell me can you stay awake for the next 8 weeks of this trial um the juror goes that's a negative I can't he gets replaced and so he ends up getting acquitted which is uh amazing and by the way him testifying and telling that story about him and the janitor and they think it helped him and it was very rare most people do not testify for their own defense they tell you don't don't go on the stand basically he he has Charisma he has some Charisma exactly so he gets on the stage anyways he gets acquitted um now this this death has all these weird circumstances so first when I heard this it just sounded like some real Epstein stuff right I was like wait these two people get acquitted on the fraud case and then both die within you know 48 Hours of each other in these quote unquote freak accidents yeah and like the accident that they described it was like basically if I remember correctly like a water tornado they're like he was sailing and there was like a tornado that like tipped over this huge sailboat uh well the crazy thing is yeah so then you read about it so I'm this is me last night swaying as I'm reading the details of this case so on one hand okay it sounded like he got killed no he didn't get killed the boat sank and the boat sank due to this like natural disaster okay that sounds pretty what what are you going to say somebody caused a water tornado and a bunch of people survived it and people survived it exactly so he could have just as he on the other hand there's stuff that came out that was like uh they didn't secure like the sort of the the the ship in the right way as you would when you had that forecast so like why didn't they do that that's a little bit strange also the guy who got hit by the car the other guy running for it to happen in that time span and they and the lady who hit him she's this 49-year-old woman um who hit him with the car she was like I couldn't see and it was like wow okay she's cooperating with authorities she doesn't look like a hitman if you go in the subreddit or you know the conspiracy subreddits it's like of course they made it look like that that's exactly how this works they make it they look for a weather pattern that's could be uh could be believed and then they'll sink the boat and then you it seems like the boat sank due to natural disasters or they find these people who don't look like Hitman but they're Hitman it's like all right I don't know what to believe in all this all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we called it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode conspiracy aside incredibly wild story that this is how this all played out and by the way during this time so he sells autonomy in 2011 something like that 2013 he starts a new company dark trace and dark Trace is this cyber security company this name does not help this whole conspiracy that's what I'm saying that there's there's more to it so if you look up what dark Trace does dark Trace I think was started back when Wikileaks happened and the idea was we're going to go to like government agencies and when Snowden and the wikileak stuff started happening it was basically I'll make sure Wikileaks and the Snowden leaks never happen to you and so they were working with all kinds of you know secret agencies to try to prevent uh that from being possible and that's what dark trace the dark Trace was also a $5 billion company that was acquire was acquired for $5 billion and so this guy was like really prolific as an entrepreneur um at the same time this incredible you know either tragedy conspiracy or freak accident it's hard to say but isn't that wild that this guy was just living in my dad's house how much is your dad okay uh I don't know the answer of this could be I don't want to give too much information to my father but let's just presume that this guy Mike Lynch is worth billions how much do you think he was paying per month for that's actually a funny thing so my dad's normal rate I think the normal rate on his airb be is like 750 bucks a night something like that uh because it's a house with multiple rooms so it's like it's cheaper than it would be if you were uh if you're a group and by the way my dad's super desperate so he'll he'll put it up for 750 someone comes in for five he's like ah it's still five five is great you know that's a lot of money I got to say yes to this and we're always telling him we're like dude like you're like you're old now don't inconvenience your life like this and he's he do it whatever so when this happened of course my first instinct is hey maybe you don't want whatever's this seems like a pretty tense situation we don't know we don't have a lot of information here there's somebody who's like you know on Trials it's like a criminal living in your house what's going on maybe you should ask him to leave and my dad's like yeah yeah yeah gonna do that calls the guy calls me back like so what happened is he agree to leave uh like are you gonna have to refund him or what he's like no he's paying triple now and I was like what and my dad's like yeah I was going to ask him to leave and then I just told him like this is really stressing me out like uh I don't know what to do can you just like this is gonna cost more and he's like sure what do you want he's like how about triple he's like okay no problem so my dad was over the moon about this whole situation most Indian thing I've ever heard that's first of all that's insane by the way uh I have a friend who just rented out their home for a Netflix show and they were spent they the home was worth like $5 million and the Netflix crew to be there and all this they were spending I believe $200,000 a month that was the rental price for three months uh which like freaking insane and so your dad was almost getting yeah he was getting that reality TV money and it was just one guy sitting in the house all day it's kind of amazing Wow first of all there's so many there's so many weird things uh about the story with when you into it what do you think happened well I was I was I'm telling you I was really thinking conspiracy and then I go into the subreddit and the top comment was so funny it goes I'm sorry but if hulet Packard arrange the hit they'd still be waiting for the correct driver to be installed I was like no that's true this HP is not ordering a hit I don't I don't believe that's the case I have studied history for a long time I'm into all this stuff conspiracy theories are always fun to read about here's my takeaway with conspiracies one they do exist sometimes so for example do you remember the OJ Simpson trial and how there was Mark Foreman he was the one of these police officers who planted the glove there yeah that is that's an example of a conspiracy that I believe like was true the problem with conspiracies there's two problems with them one secrets are really hard to keep you know what I mean like if so if 50 people know that they had to work together to do X Y and Z it's really hard particularly over decades to keep that a secret you know what I mean that's that's a that's a huge Challenge and the second thing is that when you have to hire people to do these things they're typically lower income for example someone who works at a security as a security prisoner or um a Corrections uh facility they're probably like they don't have that many options they don't make a lot of money and convincing this person to shut up for 50 years that's really [ __ ] hard it's just it's like logistically to pull off a conspiracy like that is effective it's really really hard or like let's say you're doing it with like a bunch of military people so like aund just infantry people are try you think they're going to be able to keep their mouth shut it's just challenging but it it does happen and also with like for example the EP thing is like oh and then the camera stopped working that day it's like all right this seems extremely suspect it's like the guards happened to leave and the camera shut off and he got his hands on a rope or whatever I don't know the details but but like some of these they make you they make you do this the the goatee pinch huh what's going on here well and then but there's there's a lot of times there's re have you heard of the Kennedy curse about how they all die no uh you know there's like Joe Kennedy was the patriarch he had nine kids and roughly six of them died and then like the grandkids they all died like died early you mean died early yeah for example assassinations died in plane crashes and then you like look at at like the story of each one and you're like oh this isn't a curse you guys are just Risk Takers like this guy was flying a plane when he just got his pilot's license and he was flying like a jet when he should have been flying like a much slower plane or this person um he got assassinated because he was president and like 10% of all presidents have been assassin have been assassinated do you know what I mean like there's like there's often times there's a story where uh it like each one individually can kind of make sense but add it up together it may seem too good to be true but there actually things make sense when you look down so anyway that's my opinion on conspiracies but this story is so fascinating I I remember reading about Mike Lynch and this is a crazy State at your dad's house and B I I also I kind of don't know how I feel about the story I don't know what happened yeah neither do I and by the way for conspiracies I it's like uh for most things in life you just either choose to believe or you choose not to believe right it's a choice whether you believe in something and some things when you choose to believe them they believe in them like luck like I'm a lucky person I believe that because I believe that I'm going to do different things than somebody who believes their an unlucky person will do and so it's actually less important to figure out what's true and what's not as it is to figure out what's useful to believe and what's not useful to believe in life and so some like for example conspiracies are useful to believe only for their entertainment value more so than anything else or to say I'm not going to take everything at face value I understand that there is an just like there is an error rate in every uh prediction or poll just like there's an error rate in every scientific process there is a conspiracy rate in every you know series of historical events where some number between you know 0.1 and 5% of all things that have a conspiracy are actually true so choosing to believe for entertainment value is kind of where I land on it single engine airplanes or helicopters and boats like huge Yachts two things I don't I don't touch them I think those things are so I'm so afraid of those things have you ever been on a cruise like a big ship like it's like it's it's frightening do you know how many people die on cruises every year like a huge amount because they jump off like you know what I mean like they they get lost at sea they jump off oh like they're just going for swim yeah or they're or they're drunk and they fall over the side like there's like this website called like missing at se I forget what it was and it was like all the people who go missing from cruise ships every year it's like a it's like it's like a it's a huge number um a Dead version of Facebook like this group of people that are missing at see yeah it's like a pretty disgusting thing like I'm not doing that I I can't stand cruises so but this this story is pretty wild this is this is a wild story that's while he stayed at your dad's place all right what do we want to go from here all right so for the last 15 years you and I have studied like making money would you agree like that's been like the 90% of our waking time I have agreed I would agree with that that's cool that's great and everything but um I think that I have kind of have I've learned how to do it would you agree that you kind of understand like intellectually how it's done I understand intellectually yes like it it's it's hard but well there's like three phases there's understanding intellectually realizing you thought you understood intellectually and then now you actually know intellectually and then there's doing it and I think I finally got past the third stage and now I'm think the fourth stage is either is being done with it being getting over it or being less interested in it as you go yeah for sure which by the way like uh I I actually think that that's a great like Arc and something that like I've always loved about studying making money is the idea of nothing to something and it just so happened that capitalism and making money that is a very practical way of nothing to something like it's a very straightforward way uh and and we've studied it a new thing that I'm being a little bit obsessed with about how someone goes from nothing to something is politics and not that like I actually care I don't ever want to like become political I don't want to become the president we're pivoting to the all-in podcast no I I don't want to do any of that it doesn't actually interest interest me but like when Trump became president I was like you know isn't that insane that like in his head I think he was like this is just like a bit and then it but it kind of like came to fruition that like you like became powerful and I'm like that's like insane how that happens how someone goes from nothing to something particularly in the political Arena and so I moved to this small town and I thought uh you know like it's only a 30,000 person town I'm going to email the mayor and I just want to become friends with her and just like learn about how she became mayor so I I emailed her and uh I just said like hey my name's Sam um I'm I have this podcast I have this internet company that I started and I'm basically just saying this to impress you but can I come and just introduce myself and she did she said yeah and so I met went met with her and I thought it'd be funny I I could just like do a little recap of this meeting but I said a few things that I look back and I'm like what the hell why would I ever say that so set the scene you go to her office you guys go out to lunch you go for a stroll what are you doing she's like uh you know come over we we'll go out to lunch I'm like no I don't want to go for lunch I want to like come to your office like I want to see like I want to see where the sausage is made my friend like I want to see it so I get there at like 8:45 she's walking in right about then for our 9 o'clock so we just start talking we sit down she's nice her name's Jennifer tuker she introduced herself as Jen so I guess I'll I'll call her that we're friends now and I just started talking to her and I kind of got nervous you know like I I got did you ever have to do a thing where you get married and you have to meet like with the priests in advance yeah you're like wait can this guy cancel our marriage right now if I say the wrong thing I it was the exact same thing the GU like you guys go to church I'm like dude I go to church like every day easily every day uh you know what I mean I had that like same energy where part of the Bible ah so many to choose from all of them it's hard yeah uh it was like the same thing where I'm like d i just wanty to impress her but I I've said she was like how do you like the town and I was like you know Warren Buffett says this amazing thing where he's like you got to build a business so good that uh a dummy can run it because eventually a dummy will I kind of feel like this town is like that like it's so perfect like there's nothing to play and like any idiot can run it and I was like [ __ ] uh not that you're an idiot it's just you know what I mean and so wait you said that or she said I said that I said that no you said the buffet quote about an idiot running it or yes I was like wait I'm sorry I didn't I was like I bet this in a nice way the town is like perfect like there's nothing to complain about uh and so I put my foot foot in my mouth there and then she was like oh you know that's funny I used to work for waren Buffett and I was like oh tell me about that uh was he awesome I heard he's a real cheap ass and and I'm like sorry I don't I don't know why I'm like talking like this I I I don't mean and she and so she starts telling stories about that and I'm like it seems like if you work for Warren Buffett as an executive like you must have been like pretty rich uh why would you quit that and take this crappy job and she like again kind of like laughed but like I was saying things that 10 seconds after I said it I'm like what am I doing right now and she laughed at all of them and so it was really kind of funny to like see like my first interaction with just horribly but she was in it you remind me um before you finish your story so my daughter uh is she just turned five so she she just started going to school for the first time like she's going to to to TK transitional kindergarten and as a parent you're like helpless because you don't know what your kids like you kind of give her advice but then she crosses the gate she goes into the class and you're like remember like make friends ask people questions they like that and like you know I'm trying to give her a way to socialize cuz she's smart she's fine to the school part but at the beginning she was super uncomfortable with kids and she started to do and so but I didn't know as a parent you never really know how they're behaving and so we would run into these scenarios we'd be at a coffee shop and then there's a kid who would be like hi like say her name I'm like oh do you know him is that like a kid from your school and I get really excited and then she would do what you just did which is she would just suddenly start saying and doing the funniest things like we'll be standing there and I'll be like like she won't say anything first I'm like say something is he in your class yeah okay like who's this kid and then I'll be be like hey I like your watch I like your shoes man Spider-Man cool and then she's not saying anything and then she'll just go why am I so tired and then she goes I need to go to sleep and then she laid down on the sidewalk and like pretended to go to sleep in front me and now I'm just talking to this kid and so this happened three different times with three kids why am I so tired and she just said would say this thing out of nowhere it's like a panic response and I feel like you just had your Panic response in front of the mayor where you're like Warren Buffett says pared some shitty Buffet quot yeah I'm like I don't even like Buffett what am why am I braking this up and I just called her an idiot so you take an exit off the highway and you're like this is not my destination but now I'm stuck here and then she was like she was like oh she told me what her politics was I guess she's like she's like I'm a republican but like I'm just barely right of Center and most of our town is Democrat and I was like yeah but that doesn't really matter all you do is like fill potholes and make sure the beach is make sure the beach is clean like why do your politics matter what what your beliefs have to do with this yeah I'm like and then and then I one of those things where just 10 seconds after I said that I was like [ __ ] I'm I'm blown this like I'm just I'm insulting you constantly I'm not meaning to you're you're like how long have I been on Twitter like I've just been on the internet for too long I can't like function in society anymore yeah and so uh anyway I I just thought it was like a horrible meeting that I blew but she she she handled it well by the way the last last time I met with the mayor um it was in San Francisco and so I met with London breed and she was just a council person so whatever District I don't even know what it was called literally eight hours later I met with her at like 5:00 pm that night Ed Le died and she became mayor and so I told this woman as I was leaving I was like Hey last time last time I met with the last time I met with the mayor um this woman London became uh mayor because the real mayor died and I was like [ __ ] which means you're either going to die or and I was like fre I said that uh and so anyway I just I you needed like the Men in Black pen at the end to just flash her memory and just erase the entire conversation oh man it was horrible uh but anyway I thought it was fun um have you have you been interested in politics at all or are you just totally on the sideline I'm only interested in politics from a marketing point of view meaning it's like something you watch in a movie it's like when you watch The Hunger Games and you're like that's ridiculous it's so cra like this concept is so ridiculous people just sort of like fighting for the death for the amusement of others and then I watch Like UFC 306 the next next day and I'm like oh I guess that's kind of similar or there'll be like a politician who's kind of like you know actually catering to the rich but just trying to keep the the poor like the masses um you know like just subdued enough so they they don't revolt and then you see kind of what some of the politicians do see it's interesting to me that this is real life that this is actually how things go like I watched the Trump rally the other day like end to end I don't know if you ever seen one of these but like I started where before anyone's on stage and I'm like What's the set list like who's the DJ of this because it's it goes Macho Man so it's like Macho Macho Man there like nobody on stage and the whole crowd is sitting there they're all enjoying it and I was like there's like 30 minutes of just like a set and the whole that musical set that playlist should be on Spotify and Macho Man the song that was the song that he came out to no that was the one like the the warm- up the crowd one before he comes out and which funny by because Macho Man Is by The Village People which is like a gay band yeah but they played them all YMCA they put all the hits actually another yeah and then you see the the son comes out the daughter comes out whatever anyways there's a whole so I am interested only in the like the theater of the whole thing all right let me tell you one other quick story I met the I met edley one time the guy I was working for Michael Burch he got invited to this thing and he was like I don't want to go to this political thing you should go in my as my proxy Ed Le being uh the mayor of San Francisco up until like 18 or 20 or something yeah so so this was when he was the mayor and the room was Ron Conway who is like a big shot super super angel investor invested in like pretty much every hit Silicon Valley startup probably the most respected angel investor in Silicon Valley and mark pinkis the guy who created Zinga Jeremy stelman who created Yelp and it's basically like eight of those people and then me and and they were just they just assumed I was like you know the Scribe who's there to write meeting notes and that's kind of what I actually was how old were you I'm 25 years old maybe 26 years old at the time but it's pretty fascinating to see what happens in these meetings I thought it's just kind of going to be a luncheon be some sandwiches some small talk whatever and a couple things stood out one Ron Conway is famous for taking notes I don't know if you've heard this before but he carries with him a giant Yellow legal pad and basically everywhere he goes he's just like furiously taking notes and he's taking notes often for like he's actually like very quick with people meaning if You' Hey Ron I just wanted to introduce myself he's like what can I do for you man and then you're like I just need an introduction to this person he's like tell me about your business real quick and you tell him and he's like cool I'll make the intro and he just like moves on like he's very quick because he's a lot of people want his time but he's just furiously taking notes at all time that was the first thing that stood out second thing was pinkis and Jeremy stman basically just ripped edley a new one to his face which I thought was pretty amazing what did they say they were like how do you expect us to run a business here they were like it's so expensive none of my employees can live in the city on top of that if they did live in the city there's just like incredible homelessness and like you know drugs and open air drug markets in the middle of the city what are you doing what is this like and they you know they were not as hostile as that but they were very pointed and then I got to watch you know a politician do what a politician does where they say a lot of words that don't meet a whole lot and is that what he did I was like okay cool so I see that even in the private off a supposed to be productive meeting like what is he going to do this guy's not going to he's not going to actually say anything of substance nor is he going to do anything of substance and that was kind of my takeaway from the meeting horrible takeaway I mean I mean like right yeah and I don't mean it like I don't think he had any mal intentions it was just like these are hard problems to solve in the first place figuring out the solution and then actually being able to do anything about the solution would take like so much it's how I felt when I was in a big company so you would see something and you're like we should not do that we should do something about we should do this better and then you might even try a little bit and then the forces of bureaucracy are just weighing down on you at all times it's just a lot easier to just like say f it and move on you know you're like well my computer battery just is on low battery and that email might take longer than this computer battery has so we'll just forget about it you know what I mean do you remember we did an episode really early on in the podcast back when we used to record in your office in that tiny room with a table and one microphone in between the two of us and we had Daniel gross come by and then it became three three stes on three stools sitting around one table and one thing he said he got acquired by Apple his company got acquired by Apple when he was really young I don't know 22 years old or something like that and he got advice from somebody I forgot who it was like some super legit Silicon Valley person he's like hey we just got acquired by Apple what what's your advice for me when I'm there and he was like the guy told him he goes don't give yourself brain damage he goes what he goes you're going to be in this company and you're going to see so many things that could be so much better and you're going to try to do them and for the first year you're going to try to do them you're you're actually G to make a little bit of Headway but you're not gonna actually get the result that you want and it's still going to be soow he's like basically you're going to just keep ramming your head against the wall trying to change this giant enormous company don't give yourself brain damage like find a way to enjoy your time there meet cool people you know learn from them pick up the Technologies but don't try to change don't try to turn the direction of the ship and then he goes and then I did exactly I I made that exact mistake I went and tried to like turn it around and like change the way we did things and all that he's like that person was right I shouldn't have given myself brain damage and that that he was a kid when we talked to him I think he was 25 or 26 or something uh he's amazing by the way that was uh he was amazing then too yeah that he was one of those good finds um early on can I tell you about something uh that I read this week so um I read about this in I think the Atlantic but have you ever heard of this podcast called philosophies this philosophies this is what it's called well you texted it just before this and I checked it out but I had never heard of it all right so let me tell you this story this is pretty amazing and there's a takeaway in this article that is a little bit different but his name is Steven West and he's the he's the host of this podcast and the podcast talks about like different philosophies and things like that um because the thing about philosophy is like even if it's interesting it's pretty academic and like it's not exactly applicable to like real life and it's also nudy and there's a lot of people talking about ideas that don't really change my day-to-day and he has this podcast that does the opposite of that like it's fairly applicable it's fun to listen to whatever now the thing about that's interesting about this guy is that he was actually in his uh I think he got taken away from his parents at the age of nine and he was like homeless off and on uh for a little while and then left high school at the age of 16 and then starting in 2013 he started stocking shelves inside of a gr grocery store like it was a pretty crappy job but he was able to like Find meaning in these books he would listen to an audio book he said seven hours a day he goes I would listen to uh an a audio books on philosophy seven hours a day and the last hour of the day I would do just a silly podcast it was manual physical labor but I loved it because I was able to listen to these books all the time and so by the time like a few years a few years had passed but he had listened to so many of these audio books that he kind of was like I devour Western philosophy and like I felt like I knew all about it and I loved it and so he read Tim be's 4-Hour workweek book about life design do you remember like the concept of life life design which is like you can build any life that you want to build you know but you have to map out like what does my day look like how much money do I think I need what does this all look like and he got really inspired by that which is kind of funny that this like deep philosophy nerd got into like Tim Ferris and so he launched this podcast called philosophies this it um it kind of took off and so this podcast now has like two or three million monthly downloads the YouTube has 150,000 subscribers but Stephen West the guy who is the host there's not too much information out there on him like I think he has a Twitter but he basically just tweets out uh when there's a new episode but what interested me a ton is that the article said uh the article was written about this author who's like her father was in the philosophy but he was kind of uh unsuccessful like he just like studied all day how the idea of a podcasting being being possible right now someone like Steven West he's able to make a full-time living doing this now based off of like just a hobby and there's this quote there that says Stephen doesn't PR or preach or teach he just talks to you like a smart curious adult and I read that line and that reminded me of something do you remember what the old pitch for was the uh at the hustle yeah you're smart no [ __ ] friend right something like that yeah you're smart no no [ __ ] friend telling you what you need to know about the world of tech and business news right and that was also the line for the milk Road it was like your smart non-nonsense friend telling you about all the news that's going on in the crypto world no coincidence yeah no coincidence heavily inspired by the hustles heavily inspired but there's like now that line is used a ton and I'm sure I stole that from someone else as well and I read this biography about Gideon Gartner he's the guy who started Gartner which is a research firm that is worth publicly traded $40 billion does billions Z in Revenue his whole stick early on on was I want to I want to treat my customers like they're adults and I'm just going to talk to them in a fun way but in a professional way and we're going to keep things short and the idea is we're going to treat you just like a smart adult and we're your friend and that's kind of like an interesting takeaway because in business there's like you can come up with the new technology or whatever that takes off you can uh come up with the better product but one way I think to stick out is branding and branding is kind of a nebulous thing where it's like it's kind of challenging what's a good brand and this whole idea of we're just going to treat our customers like smart adults and we're g going to be casual about them that is a shtick that I have seen work in so many different Industries and it has worked consistently he does uh that wonderfully you and I do that wonderfully that podcast Founders which uh I love does that wonderfully there's so many different content niches that do that wonderfully but there's so many different brands that do that wonderfully with this idea of like we're g to be cool but not like actual cool but more like casual we're going to be your friend do you know what I mean right dude the uh when I went to Austin to record all those podcasts I had a list of the people that were doing the podcast with and I was supposed to be excited about them it was like oh I'm gonna do a podcast with Tim Ferris and with monish PAB and Joe Londale right then there was all these meetings in between and then there was one meeting that came up at the last second that I got super excited about and it was to meet Tim Urban Tim Urban's the guy who writes waight but why he's wrote a bunch of books now and so he's got this blog that I love so we go and we meet with Tim Urban and I'm like dude um I I go isn't it insane that you have this little blog on the internet you used to just write whatever was interesting to you and then one day the richest greatest entrepreneur in the world slid into your DMs and was like yo I like your stuff and it's like you want to hang out and then and you're referring to Elon Musk is a huge fan of was like hey this is awesome you're awesome this is awesome I'd love to meet and the background being Tim Urban runs a Blog called wait but why which when you and I were in our 20s it was the hottest thing going and it's still popular but it's like an intellectual blog but silly it's kind of the same description of what you said right yeah it's a it's a guy who's smart he's writing about the stuff that's on his mind and he's honest the way he writes it and he he he treats you well whatever so he was like yeah it was crazy then Elon meets him and Elon basically says I would love for you to write I like he's like a bunch of people want to interview me you know they want me on 60 Minutes they want me on this they want me on that but I actually want you to write about what we're doing with AI with neuralink with Tesla with SpaceX like all of these things I would love and you you could write whatever you want I'm not saying write something positive but I like your writing I'd like you to write so then he wrote These series with Elon basically he wrote A neuralink series he wrote like a AI series he wrote like all these things they were super popular and I was like how crazy that could you have imagined that when you started just writing on your random blog that one day the richest most powerful entrepreneur in the world will will just slide into your DMs and just say that to you he's like no he's like no I obviously couldn't have imagined that but he goes I did always have a rule which is my rule when I write is write for equals and I said write for equals that's I immediately I was like ah I love that what is that and he goes is a big Temptation on the internet which is to create content that you think is for the masses let me tell you about how this all works I know you don't know I'll dumb this down I'll sort of water this down I'll shave off some of the edges I won't tell you about anything of the unknown I'll tell you all the known stuff because that's what you want because you need a Lunchable and you want your cracker and your cheese and then you want your um your ham and then you're going to put those three together and that's your that's what you're going to get for lunch and he goes I also don't want to go the other way which is I'm trying to impress all these people and therefore I'm going to act out of character trying to write to impress people who I think are more advanced than me and I'm going to you know fluff up my language use all this jargon and try to make it sound smarter than it really is instead I just sit down I just try to write for equals and he goes the beautiful thing he didn't say all this but the the beautiful thing of that is when you actually put yourself out there you will attract by definition like-minded people you will attract the the people who like what you do will be the people who like you and then you could just keep being you which is a lot easier than trying to guess what other people might like and so there's like this flywheel that starts and I would say this is probably the most common mistake that I've made every content creator makes is this this feeling that maybe I should bend my content to the masses or maybe I should bend it to impress these folks rather than just the simple write for equals three words I thought it was wonderful but my and my point in bringing this up is that this goes beyond content this is about running your company a certain way and Tillman fertita you know he's this guy who um what does he own he owns uh landries and a bunch of restaurant chains that are popular a ton of restaurant TR steak houses and stuff I read his biography and he and he and he told this story he's like let me explain like a little bit about my philosophy and he apparently it was like 11:30 or something at one of his restaurants and someone ordered an omelet and the rule was like breakfast ends at 11: or 10:30 or something and they like turned the customer down and he heard about this he goes dude the eggs are right there just say like I'm going to go scramble you some eggs like I got you let me take care of you and it's just this idea of like following rules versus treating someone like a human and it's like a huge deal and it's really and what I'm saying is so simple but it's actually hard at Hampton we only have 20 employees but I still have to remind people I go just act like we're a mom and pop business like treat people a certain way where you're like they're just like you know you own like a corner badega and you see the same people every day like oh you want the usual like I got you and that's actually really hard to do uh it's hard to teach people how to do that because they want to act a certain way but here's a certain here's another good example Anan our friend Anan who runs a company called CB insights I don't know how big they are but they're around the idea they're around what's say 100 million a year in revenue and so CB insights makes a very professional Enterprise level business that cost $100,000 a year their website up until recently the homepage said without data you're just an idiot with an opinion and they have a newsletter that he sends once a week to all their customers as well as their potential clients and at the end of the email he signs it with I love you a not or like they would say things like please buy a subscription because I owe people money like they would use people a lot of money yeah he would like use these funny things and I would see that and I'm like not everyone's stick is to be funny but everyone's stick should be like to not change necessarily from just treating people like a human and so when I saw this line about philosophy which is like a very like lame thing like I've tried to learn about it and it's like they have like like they don't want you to to like approach this topic because it's very guarded and I love that this guy's doing this and it reminded me that we should be doing this with a lot of different things there's also another angle of this which is a lot of people when they go into a business will start thinking about what industry do I like what product do I like and they when you're told to kind of like follow what you like you sort of typically think oh I'm interested in healthc care or um you know I really like media and you just pick pick at this like really like 9,000 fot level and a different way to do it is work backwards from your customers so which customers do you respect which customers do you love which customers do you want understand and which customers would you want to hang out with right so pick your customer and then work backwards from that so instead of picking an industry and trying to find a business you could pick a customer and try to find a paino that could become your business um I think with Hampton you did a good job of this which is you want to hang out with all of your customers they're cool people those are the type of people you like to hang out with you business owners and people who are somewhat successful and trying to do interesting things in their life so you picked a business where you like understand and um are attracted to that customer and therefore you'll always sort of stay in love with that business another version of that that I found for myself is most of the time for any business you're not Building Product most of the time actually as an entrepreneur like when you sign up to start a business you're actually signing up to try to grow a thing yeah you're selling most of the time you're selling most of the time Paul Graham wrote a blog post startups equals growth like what is the differentiator between a small business and a startup it's that a startup is designed to grow fast and a small business is might be like a barber shop or a nail salon doesn't have to grow fast and so if you're going to be focused on growth 90% of your brain and that therefore selling then it actually makes sense to work backward from what is the type of sale I will need to do to make this successful so for example I've had ideas where I'm like oh that would be a great product I would love to make that product and companies would benefit from that product but the problem is to do that product to make that product grow I would need to do Enterprise sales something I do not know anything about nor would I want to know anything about I'm not curious about that right and so actually that business is not that product it's Enterprise sales and do I want to do Enterprise sales every day for the next seven years do I want to build a team that's really good at doing Enterprise sales for the next seven years I found for myself for example I love running ads like the first time I started doing an e-commerce business and I was like wow I can just set up this one ad and this ad will money machine it's a money machine he works all night I don't even have to think about this business my calendar doesn't need to be booked with calls I don't need to send cold emails every day this ad will just keep hustling out there I'm sending out these armies to the corners and they're selling for me right all I need to do do you like talk to the ad like like hey sweetheart how are you nice to see you this morning ads I'm like thank you so much you take this tiny commission this small CPM fee and in change you can sell 24/7 around the clock to every single City and every single country and all around the world you are an amazing employee to ad and so I work backwards from ad companies or content right I love creating content so if the main way to grow this business is content then dope I want to do that so picking your business based on what is the sales method is a far better way to build a business that you love and that will actually succeed than to pick the product or the industry that you think you're that you think you like yeah I completely agree um you said something earlier you said um you you start studying how you make money and then you realize um you don't know [ __ ] and then you kind of learn it and then you start like all right I know it I just get to give myself 10 years and then I care less about it than I thought are you in that stage um in and out so I think every by the way everything goes to that stage I want to know it I know it ah [ __ ] I thought I knew it I didn't know it at all and then you finally get to the point where you actually know but you only know it in your head you don't know it in your hands you don't know how to actually do it right it's that example I gave one time on the podcast of I watch this guy make this amazing like you know scrambled egg and it was Fluffy and it was perfect and it had chives and it was just looked so good and watching that I was like I I know step by step what he did because he showed me step by step what he did with the camera with the audio with the instructions on the screen but if I went and tried to make that egg right now I'd make a horrible mess everywhere and so first you go from i i i intellectually know the blueprint and I Know It In My Head then I know it in my hands and then at a certain point you still enjoy maybe the craftsmanship of doing it but the novelty of figuring out how to do it of solving the puzzle that goes away because you kind of solve the puzzle more and more and I think a good thing in life is to to sort of seek new puzzles so right now for example the puzzles I'm seeking the things I'm more fascinated about rather than how did this business get to 5 million AR with 60% EIT margins is the creative process how do the most creative people in the world who create dope [ __ ] how do they live their life what do they do how do they think how do they what is the conversation they have in their head which is the same thing I used to ask about entrepreneurs I just find myself more gravitating towards creative people who are living maybe a unique life or an artist based life and then what are they doing and that's where my current Fascination is you're drifting towards these beat Nick artists I'm I'm I'm wondering how the politicians gain all this power golly we are sellouts aren't we no we're not sellouts we're we're grown-ups all right where do we want to go from here I guess that's it that's the p [Music]

all right today we were sitting down with one of the smartest people that's ever been on this podcast his name is elad Gil and he is a prolific angel investor he's a guy who has invested in something like 40 plus billion dollar companies all at very early stages like Airbnb air table and real retool ripling companies that we've all heard of down the tech space he was a entrepreneur he got acquired by Twitter he was one of the first 100 employees at Twitter he was early at Google and he's been very early to waves he's he was doing longevity longevity was cool he was doing AI investing before chap GPD came out so we love talking to people who are like this that are both very brilliant very accomplished and seem to be skating where the puck is going they sort of know what's coming around the corner and they've proven that in their career so we talked to him about how he's been such a good investor what he's looked for and his approach and how it's pretty different than most investors we talked about his ideas so things he wants to see built and projects he's working on right now and then a little bit of Life advice at the end where he left us with kind of an amazing tid or a nugget about what's made him such an interesting person so enjoy this episode with El [Music] Gil and so the intro for you is basically you're a super angel investor uh you've invested in a bunch of companies I think you have something like 40 plus unicorns in the portfolio and impressively at least 20 or 30 of them were very early stage so seeds stay series a precede some somewhere there that's wild as somebody who's invested in I don't know 100 companies myself I look at what you've done there and that is prolific and so first question it's like you know there's a block of wood and I don't really know how to hack how to how to chop into this so I'm just GNA swing one blunt swing here how the heck are you doing this why how have you had this this success in Angel Investing yeah I mean I guess it's um it's probably two or three things number one I think I was just lucky you know so I think I started investing in a good time when there was a lot to still be done in SAS and consumer and a variety of areas now obviously that's also true in AI I think secondly I tend to take more of a market first approach um than most early stage people I focus on the market and product Market more than the founders and obviously Founders are incredibly important I started two companies myself so I hope that Founders are incredibly important but I also think that what you're actually building and which market for who matters a lot and I've seen great people crushed by terrible markets and I've seen reasonably mediocre people do really well um and then lastly I think I really try to follow the technology um and the changes that are happening in technology and so I got I got involved with a lot of generative AI companies quite early you know perplexity and Harvey and things like that simply because I was really keen on generative Ai and sort of ml related stuff so so I started investing in all those things three years ago before chatu BT was out and before mid journey and before these things really became a trend and so I think sometimes you end up early in some really important areas simply because your kind of Technology first or Market Chang first were you just doing your own money at first or did you have a fund from the Geto no initially I was just investing my own money um and then I ran out pretty fast you know I hadn't made that much money at gole and I I invested almost all of it I invested like over 50% of it and so I just started running out as I started what does that mean running out like how like uh I guess you initially had wealth from selling your business I guess and then like you just put all of it into private companies how much do you I put a huge amount of my own money into private companies yeah so you know one of my big regrets is um somebody pinged me on the SpaceX round when it was like a $500 million company and I really was excited about it I thought it was such a interesting game and I just I didn't have enough money for the minimum that they had as check sizes and so what' you do because you know I I had that point early in Silicon Valley where I initially had no money so I was like I was helping friends I was like man I can't believe people aren't investing this but I myself didn't even look at myself like an investor because I just didn't have a bank roll then I realized wait stupid I got to think like a Founder here and get resourceful and figure out how to get money to invest in these companies so where did you go once you deployed your own Capital where'd you go to get the money right away yeah you know I started um effectively raising small sort of what are known as spvs and then that morphed into funds and now I kind of have a a TI misuk cake of different things where there's like different layers that I can do in terms of personal Investments fund Investments you know very large things would be fun plus SPV so for example I led Andel series D or I co the last two rounds for um applied Intuition or you know I've L rounds for all sorts of companies at this point how many other are there any other partners at your like shop basically or you the guy you know I've I've recently hired a few people to kind of help me in different ways I think fundamentally what I want to do is um continue to build things work on things think about technology like just take I would to call it almost like the anti- BC approach and be Builder first and so there's a lot of side projects that I or me and my team are now working on you know we're working for example um sh's helping me with um we're trying to take the the the Thousand um most important books that are off of copyright and translate them into dozens of languages using Ai and then create audio books off of any of off of all of them so people can download the great works of um history from anywhere in the world in any language you know we're doing stuff like that and so that also forces us to really use different AI tools and let's look at 11 versus CIA versus you know open Ai and let's let's how do you actually translate a long form book with high consistency and how do you QA that are you doing that because you're like this could be a business or are you doing that because you're thinking to yourself just this is an interesting project and in doing this I will discover interesting things I'm doing because I think it's like cool and societally useful I mean like there's multiple aspects of why to work on something like this and I think it's um a little bit less shortterm and more like this seems useful and interesting but were you always that way because like I just recent I'm I guess I'm I could say I'm financially secure and it took a few years before I just recently started feeling like I want to do blank because it's cool I don't really care necessarily if it's good for the world but it seems like you have a little bit of that mindset of like this is good for the world are you wealthy and successful because you always had that attitude or do you have that attitude now because you have security do you know what I mean uh I've always been that way and so you know I started off I you know I did degrees in math and biology and I did a PhD in biology because I thought it was societally useful like you're not going to make money as a PhD in biology you know unless something magic happens and so um my my driver has always been what is useful societally I think the one other thing I'd say about it is it forces you to go deeper than um people tend to go on some of these things that they're just kind of oh this is an interesting investment or what whatever I think you actually go to that next extra level of depth and using things Hands-On and all the rest of it that I think also matters just in terms of gaining real intuition for certain things and I don't think you need to be a practitioner of everything to understand the thing that you're you're a practitioner of but I just think it in some cases it can help a lot or it really um allows you to hone in on what's important and that's true of many businesses usually most businesses have one or two things that are the fundamental aspect of that business that matters and everything else is just noise or check the box or whatever and I think that where people tend to sometimes either start the wrong things as Founders or invest in the wrong things as investors is they get too wrapped up and what are the five things that matter for this business and usually there's one maybe two what what's an example of like I'm not sure which industry you're you're you care about most but what's an example of one of these things where people care about five things but you're like no this is the only thing that matters well I mean I guess early on with stripe their their one Insight was how do we just get every developer using this product we're not going to worry about mid-market and Enterprise we're not going to worry about and other things how do we get every early stage technology company that matters on us that that sounds great when you tell that story I'm like yeah I'm on board with that but I own a business now and it's really hard to come up with that Insight I think it's hard but I think this the flip of it is that's that's usually the key question and again different types of businesses may have that characteristic or not right and so sometimes it's two things or you know some complex bus business that may have more you know and invested in andell there was a very clear there's kind of like five things I thought a nextend defense tech company had to do in order to become a prime which is you know one of the really big companies in the market and I thought without it you're just not going to make it and so sometimes it's more complicated but I think I think 90% of the time plus it's it it boils down to one era of belief or maybe one thing that you just need to see happen in the business to believe that everything else will fall into place all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 Mill million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we call it very appropriately we called it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode it's also like it's also hard now but easy later right if it's hard to figure out what the one thing is okay you take some upfront difficulty to to sort of make a bet or to figure that out but then from there on out your operating philosophy can be a lot simpler because you're now striped you know who you're focused on you know who you're catering to and you don't have to have these like the Val the decision tree becomes very very simple later if you make if you did the hard thing and it evolves over time right the complexity of these businesses often comes later as they become multi-product and international and you know all the rest of it and that's that's normal it's just um early on usually there's there's a key Insight that drives it you said you invest in markets and andrel when it was first started most people still don't have any idea about the about that industry when you're trying to like Master a topic like that what is your process yeah with with Ander um you know the main reason I got interested in defense Tech was because the big tech companies were running away from it right Google shut down Maven and I was like well of course we're going to need National Defense whether you're a Democrat or Republican like of course you know like you want to protect Western values there's conflict in the world there's Bad actors but to push back on that I'd be like yeah but there's like I'm I'm ignorant to the industry which is why it's easy for me to push back I would say yeah but there's like 10 other companies in that space you know they got it covered like how do you how do you learn enough to know that there's like an interesting opportunity yeah I mean I guess it's a bunch of stuff one is obviously you just read what you can right two is uh in some cases you look at Market structure and growth rates and that that kind of stuff third is you look at technology shift I want to break down on that what's your resource for the second one uh we just go and do the work I mean you look at what are the companies and obviously there's like analyst reports and market research and all that stuff but you can also just ask okay how many players are in the market is it consolidating or not what's the growth rate on it what is the margin structure and the approach that they're taking as a business right so for example um the traditional defense tech companies or what are known as Cost Plus which means if you have a million dollar drone they charge 5% so they can't make more than 5% margin they make 50 can a drone your andreil you can sell 10 better drones for a million dollars you make 50% margin which is traditional Hardware margin you make 10 times the margin dollars and so one of the things that people don't appreciate about Andel as a business is it's a market cap expansion in the defense world because you have a higher margin higher leverage business right and so you need a different business model which they they've come up with um there just a bunch of stuff like that right did you how early did you invest in Andel I think you were like the first round it was just the founders yeah and so was it you hear Palmer talking about this then you go research the market or had you just independently been curious about this market and then no it's it's back to what I was saying earlier which is Google shut down Maven and I was like oh my God the big tech companies are running away from this what a wonderful opportunity for a startup and so I actually called one of the people at Google that I knew who was working on Google Cloud which the maven team was part of at the time and I said hey did all the people who wanted to do Maven quit and protest and he's like no no no it was all the people who are against Maven who quit the rest of people are still here so I like okay where do I find somebody who wants to work on this um and so I just started poking around and um I met I ran into try at something and we started talking and he mentioned he was working on it I got super excited about it so I invested in their first round or they were kind enough to let me invest in their first round I should say that's way more impressive than meeting Palmer like the fact that you came to that a similar you guys were sniffing around the same stuff independently that's pretty impressive well yeah but I'm also you the best people I get to interact with they sort of have the same uh laid-back approach as you which is just like I don't know I just kind of do the work I think I was fortunate blah blah blah then you start to peel back layers and you're like oh so this thing you called luck was actually you I read that Maven story too I didn't think to myself wow what a wonderful opportunity I just moved on with my life right so uh you know I don't know if you've read the four levels of luck thing but I think number two or three is uh luck favors the prepared the prepared mind meaning because you know what you're looking for you can actually spot luck when it presents itself whereas the average person might see that same thing and not understand what they're looking at and so when you saw that Maven story you saw the opportunity that wow if the big technology players are running away from defense this huge category that means there's an opportunity for a new technology company in defense and so what you know what I find fascinating is is peeling that back uh and actually understanding like wow that was incredibly intentional and I get what you're saying that not every one of those rabbit holes you go down leads to an andil seed round uh but the fact that it ever did is is remarkable because that's like a career- making you know single investment even let alone the other 40 that you did like that I also want to go back to like you said something about uh you know Market first and there's that great quote like uh when a great entrepreneur meets a bad Market only one of them keeps their reputation um the bad market and so how uh what's another example from your portfolio that you can think of that drives home this kind of like Market first where the market first approach LEDs you to do something that um that worked out uh you know I did a lot of crypto investing in like 2017 is 2016 through 2018 and that was because there was such an obvious C change from an adoption and sort of Technology basis there you know the AI stuff is another one you know all the AI companies I invested in was a little bit like hey the Market's Shifting the technolog is Shifting the fli side of it is there's lots of things that I invested in that only in hindsight could I come up with a theme right I invested in notion air table and retool within I don't know two years of each other whatever the time frame was but at the time there was no low code no code kind of thesis it was just these are really interesting Founders working in interesting areas and so in hindsight there was a market or at least there was a trend but at the time it was just like these are smart people working on good stuff and so it's a little bit of that um how do you balance both of those perspectives and sometimes your thesis driven and sometimes you're just like you know what the thousands of great Founders out there working on ideas are going to come up with better ones than I am and so you know let's let's have a open mind on everything I think it was on the information or something like that they talked about how you had just raised like a billion dollars and that you famously didn't have any employees and Sam mman has this or I don't know who said it I thought it was Sam Alman where he said something like a one or two person billion dollar company is going to be a thing now because of AI but that's kind of what you've already done um you know it already existed before that Minecraft was like I don't know what three people when Microsoft bought it but that's sort of like what you're doing like you've got a pretty huge business with two or three or however many people you have or up until recently I think according to these these articles you had like two people um I mean I think there's a long history of this kind of stuff and if if you look at the world's biggest hedge funds or you look at a lot of later stage firms they tend to have that structure right and so if you look at a traditional investment firm there's usually one or two people who do most of the good Investments I think in general there's this odd collapsing down to a handful of people in many types of Endeavors but the reality is there have been multiple businesses that have hit enormous scale that have been quite small and I think Minecraft is really a canonical example of that again there's also the need to go big sometimes right sometimes you want to win the market and you should hire a ton of people and so I think the future of T person companies at least in the medium term is very overstated I think AI is largely going to be business as usual and certain types of teams are going to shrink a lot right I'm an investor in a company called decagon for example that's working on the customer success side and that's an area where I think there'll be enormous leverage to existing customer success reps but probably there's an overall shrinkage in that industry if you look at things like what Clara announced around their use of AI and customer success right so I think certain teams will get impacted first versus others through AI I think the two person AI company is largely in the future but there are historical precedents of this happening before AI right do you measure um I mean obviously you measure but I guess like what is the metric that you keep track of for your own investing so like you know at the top of this we talked about you know number of unicorns but you know you can look look at irr you can look at your DPI you can you know I did a deep dive on YC the other day and there's like some insane number I'm going to butcher it because I I don't have it right in front of me but like Sam I don't know if you know this but like the first 10 years of YC they basically turned like something like 12 million dollar into like 10 billion dollar of value for them from themselves because they were writing super small checks early on and getting basically like was 7% 7% but it even diluted down like the airbnbs the drop boxes like just the F even just the the top five companies they let's say they net own like 2% of these when they go public I mean they basically had a you know 320x on their money in that first decade and then a lot of people now think that they're you know maybe have they've sort of lost their touch or the batch size are too big or the valuation is too high and actually like their hit rate has gone up even as the batch size has gone up it's pretty pretty wild Eli do you do you have a metric that you look at that you kind of you're proud of or that that's the main metric for you of how you've done in terms of the actual money and money out you know the most important thing to me and obviously you know I want to be a fidu Sherry for other people's money a lot of my own money is in the funds I invest Etc so obviously there there's a financial return aspect of it but to me the most important things are probably twofold one is um making sure that founders of Yumi is a useful and positive resource and two is being involved with the most important Technologies and technology companies in the world CU I I think that's how you drive societal impact so I view I view technology as a lever on the world right I'm not an angel investor but you're such a hard person to compete against because you're like you it just you it's very strange that you're an investor because you don't seem like you're Money Motivated you know what I mean and that's a really challenging person to compete against because that's the type of person who wins in a lot of stuff it's the one who's not actually caring about the money but who's caring about mission AR versus mercenary type of vibe do you know what I mean yeah I know what you mean I think Nala has a great framework on this um because you know John dor used to ask you know are you a missionary or mercenary to Founders in the 90s and of course you had to say I'm a missionary right like how could you possibly say you're mercenary and the's streamwork is um is like well of course early in your career you're at least partially a mercenary otherwise you're never going to find the opportunity and go in it and then later in your life you're a missionary right you're not Zero Sum you're trying to do things for the greater good and then uh once you've made it in your career you should become an artist you should be doing it for the love of The Craft and now for each person there's a different mix of that over time and I think you know for me the motivator is very much technology is a lover on the world right that's why I was trying to do biology that's why I detect that's you know it's like how do you do the important things in the world now if you're working on the most important problems in the world with the best people then probably you end up with a good Financial return because you're in the middle of the stuff that matters right um but that doesn't have to be the motivating goal and that's why sometimes I don't know if you've ever sat at a dinner which is allc is it's like really boring because you're surrounded by at least a subset of people who are very money-driven and the conversation I'll give you an example one time I was sitting at a friend's um wedding dinner and I just happened to get seated at a table where a lot of the other people were um his board which meant a lot of investors and I sat next to somebody from a wone firm and um I said hey what are you interested in these days and he said crypto and I said oh great we can talk about distribute consensus and trustless systems and censorship uh resilient products and all this stuff and I said that's that's great like what are you excited about in crypto and he looks me in the eyes and he says you can make a [ __ ] lot of money at it I was like H I thought he was joking right I started laughing I'm like oh that's so funny no seriously he's like no that's that's it that's not a really interesting conversation well one of the things I liked uh is that on your website you publish some ideas that you're interested in or you're working on right now or you want people to come help you pull off I'd love if we could rip through a couple of these uh let's start with one that caught my eye he said I want to do a new chain of K through 12 schools inspired by ancient Greece what's that all about yeah I mean I think uh fundamentally um anybody who has kids realizes that you know there may be certain as aspects of um the education system that are emphasized and deemphasized and it feels like there's four or five things that are really useful for kids to learn and I think it'd be great to um try and help establish something that could be used broadly um across you know uh cities or regions across the country that would really focus on some of those basic aspects of learning what did the ancient Greeks do what what do the ancient Greeks have to do with this uh it's just use as an example really what you need to find is what is the framework that you're going to use to apply so that you have some compass and consistency and there's a certain emphasis on reasoning and logic and thinking and discourse and debate that I think was was resident in that time there's an emphasis on mathematics there was an emphasis on writing there was an emphasis on trying basic forms of understanding you know that's when you had Archimedes and lovers and that's when you had early um interesting mathematics emerge and um that's when you had great philosophical treaties written so you know I think there's a lot of that's also when you focus a lot on beauty and art there's a lot of emphasis on the physical and being physically fit and resilient so there's there's a lot of stuff there now a lot I I remember when I I lived in SF from 12 to 20 and I think there was a a handful of schools that were started for elementary kids it was alt school one of them and was there a Wonder school is that does that ring a bell those were more kind of like Hey we're gonna use technology Etc I don't think there's any need for technology I think you just need a couple good teachers and like a reasonable curriculum and so again I I think it's not that that I'm not trying to reinvent the school system I just think you could go back to certain types of Basics it's interesting there's a school in San Francisco called proof school which I think is fascinating um I think their their line or motto is like for kids who love math and they have a very strong emphasis on mathematics and their curriculum and you know kids are doing machine learning in like 10th or 11th grade and um you know I I find things like that kind of inspiring where they're like okay we're going to take a different lens on it and our lens is just kids who love math and let's find out what's the right curriculum for those kids and maybe some of the early literature classes emphasize sci-fi because those are the types of books they like and maybe the the history we focus on is XYZ versus something else and so I just think um that's a good example of like a really smart approach to schooling um there's a variety of people who've done these differentiated approaches what's your plan with uh with this school thing is you're you're looking for kind of an entrepreneur to spearhead it what what are you looking for uh yeah I need somebody to spearhead it I think um you know traditionally there's this directly responsible individual or drri problem right it's really easy to come up with ideas and then usually you need um help executing them and so you know it's something that'd be happy to sponsor uh but I I really would need to find somebody who can drive that sort of thing dayto day you know my kids are very happy in the schools that they're currently in so it's more just something that I think would be societally useful to do more broadly um and then uh especially if you can do it as a chain then you end up with some sort of consistency and the ability to bring it to different populations that may not have access to this sort of schooling and other things and so I think there's a really interesting project to be had there what other ideas Sean did you have listed there uh there's one cool one you you said you I think got a PhD biology and you talked about longevity you've looked into a lot of longevity you funded clinical trials and you said something that um I was curious about you said there's some exciting things that are going on in longevity uh you mentioned a company called bioage and how they have a new drug for muscle okay you have my attention what is the new drug for muscle and generally what's exciting to you about that space yeah I mean biow is a company that just went public um and is in their quiet period so there probably isn't a 10 I should say about them I was an early investor there and a board Observer and um I think I was the first investor in that company actually it's a the the CEO is this really exceptional PhD and post talk I think she did her post talk at Stanford biocomputation of aging and you know they now have um different uh drugs in different phases of clinical trials or pre pre-clinical work and all that should be in their S1 and in their public Financial materials that I would encourage people to go look at but in general I think that aging is an area that's been dramatically underinvested in and part of that is because of the structure of big Pharma and you know that that industry tends to have very old companies right sort of driving the agenda which has its own implications then obviously it's it's highly regulated uh but also if you just look at for example the National Institutes for aging which is a very small budget relative to the NCI for cancer or other parts of the NIH and most of that budget just goes to Alzheimer's and so actual fundamental Research into aging is quite sparse we know that aging is a developmental program that can be perturbed right I actually worked on that for my PhD I worked at the intersection of Aging longevity in um excuse me longevity cancer and Insulin there's certain evolutionarily conserved Pathways that if you tweak them you end up with organisms that'll live a lot longer right you can knock out a gene and SE allans that lives two three times longer for example as a healthy adult and and we know that there's drugs that do that in mice Etc genes that do that in mice which means you can do drugs um I like how you're saying we know as if uh me or Sam know anything we don't know this you you you smart PhD people know this and uh can you explain in Lay from what you just said you said there's like we know that every He he'll say like a sentence and there's like five things and I'm like wait what yeah five tabs need to open in my browser okay seans they're living 2x longer uh you said that aging is a something driven thing a developmental program so basically there's a few different theories of Aging one of the theories of Aging is you just accumulate a bunch of damage over time and systems break because of that damage mechanical damage type of it's just mechanical damage you get hit by sunlight and UV and whatever um and then there's another view of Aging which is this more almost like a developmental program that's regulated by signals in your body just as you know when you go from a baby to a child to an adult or whatever that's just a developmental program and if you look at different organisms different organisms will have different clocks for aging right and so why why can turtles live so long or why why do certain animals die so young right and you're like it's just a developmental program they have a set lifespan that's genetically defined and why would that be the case like why would we have an off button uh you know there's all these theories and who knows I mean I don't I'm you know I don't know uh there there's theories but I don't know which theor is right um and uh the the other piece of information that we have is that we know that there's certain drugs that will extend lifespan in multiple organisms you take a drug and or you give a drug to something and it lives longer rra a mice in to be example where in mice um mice will live 10 to 30% longer based on actually their sex right so female mice I think will live longer than male mice on Rapa m and then there's Knockouts that you can do in genes and if you knock out a gene certain organisms will live a lot longer and that means that you can develop a drug for it right that's how the drug industry works you can do a drug that mimics a gene knockout or a gene up regulation and you end up with the same effect and so we know that you can make things live much longer and there is very little being done in people around that and so the question is why right and imagine if you had another 30 or 40 or 50 healthy years and when you say the question is why what's the answer is it that uh it's not funded enough it's not safe enough there's some other commercial disincentive for three things it's not funded enough uh for all sorts of reasons um second is from a regulatory framework perspective until very recently the FDA did not have like a a good definition of of what it means to build an aging drug right uh because in general this sort of three in the broader medical world aging is not considered a disease it's considered a natural state and so why would you develop a drug against a natural state and so uh there's a company called Loyal which is doing aging and dogs and they actually defined a series of like end points is that Kevin Rose is that the thing Kevin Rose invested in I think he talked to us about it I don't know that's like my favorite like longevity company he like yeah forget the humans let's save like I'm all about it let's save the dogs I think it's both uh going to have an easier regulatory pathway but also uh good for society like uh my dog living longer I I I support nothing more than than that um does that what have they found is that working I haven't kept up with the like actual science of the company yeah I I I I don't know I'm not an investor though I think the founder is quite good um I just haven't uh been involved there um you know as I mentioned one of the main things I've been involved with in that is a company called bioage which again just went public and there's all sorts of information there in the public domain now about them that is worth looking up you uh you know there what was that crazy quote it was like um what Silicon Valley nerdy people are doing for fun that's like what everyone else is going to do in the next like 10 or 15 years or something like that nerds do on the weekend I hope not because then there's going to be a lot of veganism which sounds awful well that's what I was going to ask you which is like you uh you kind of fit that stereotype you have a lot of resources and you're in the know with a lot of like interesting new things are you taking any like interesting Pharmaceuticals are you doing metformin what do you think is interesting uh right now that you think will be a little bit more popular in two three four five years yeah the honest answer is I don't know i' I've tried to stay away from taking anything chronically unless I think it would have a huge impact and so far there isn't anything in the market that would really map to that you know a lot of it honestly is like do exercise do sleep do eat well you know there's there's reasonably good data around rap ayon that people should work with their doctor on and sort of figure out if it but you're not no yeah I haven't done anything there so again I've I've tried to ask Let Me Wait until there's something that I feel is big enough impact some people for example in the Aging Community will take a certain subclass of statins um for heart disease and neuro and then they'll take um I think a subset was taking some baby aspirin similarly for heart disease so there's some people have done some things that um uh again you should talk to your doctor about if if you want to consider stuff like that I haven't done anything like that because I just don't want to take things every day when Sam says that quote about you know what the Nerds are are doing on the weekends and what they're tinkering with in their spare time is what we'll we'll all be doing you know 10 years from now I'm just going stra to hardcore gene therapy so I'm just gonna yeah I'm just kidding I'm gonna crisper my genome but are you kidding I mean it sounds pretty cool I'm kidding yeah yeah I think um a lot of that stuff feels very premature to me there are some people doing self-experimentation like that in the public domain I I just don't know that some of those things will work it's it's kind of interesting because I feel like when people talk about Gene delivery there's like three or four aspects of it that matter and everybody focuses now on sort of the crisper side of it which is can you modify a gene in a in a Cell versus can you target it to the right cells will your immune system Target those cells and turn it off like there's all this other stuff that H can you hit enough cells for it to matter there's all this other stuff that traditionally have been the real issues of gene therapy that are aren't being addressed as effectively as sort of the crisper Casta so you um you've been interested in longevity earlier than I would say like this current current kind of wave of interest you know I think you not not only did you study it in school you it's I saw on your site you said you personally identified a gene that's involved in a lifespan you funded your own clinical trial at Stanford it didn't work but you're like it's okay I'll try I I'm happy to try again um I'm curious what do you think of Brian Johnson and what he's doing you know I've I've never met him um I haven't looked deeply into what he's doing so I think it's great that people are raising awareness for this kind of stuff but I don't have any specific Insight or opinion like I just haven't looked into it I'm surprised how come you haven't looked into it that seems like it's right up your alley I've been busy in terms of just focusing on like hardcore biofarma for this stuff right like drug development that can benefit Society at large that's that's what I V so it's just a different area of Focus right what I want to know is are there any ideas on there that are just they're just cool but not necessarily like a world changing serious thing like do youever his monuments thing can he talk about The Monuments thing I think that's dope oh um so one thing again I need I need somebody to come work with me on this and I'd happily uh fund it is um if you look at every society is sort of its peak um they they would build large scale monuments towards progress and so it's like the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World honestly I don't know if you know the the origins of the Eiffel Tower but it was built in the late 1800s for a world fair in Paris to show off French steel making prowers right it was an O to technology and an O to steel making cuz steel was like modern tech and it was very controversial at the time people ugly and all this stuff right a lot of bridges were were built in America at that period you know with Andrew Carnegie they were built with that idea of like let's prove so like the eids bridge in St Louis it was the same thing where they would do these they would build these amazing Bridges and then they would do like all these funny things like they would get an elephant to walk across it to prove to prove that it works it's strong you know what I mean and uh but yeah but so like these like flexes uh like existed there's a there's a Flex side of it and there's an inspirational side of it like where are the large scale inspiring pieces of beauty and art in society anymore like where have they gone why aren't we doing those anymore Vegas sphere that's the last one no seriously the sphere I think I think that's a real example of large scale societal Beauty right well you know what another example that sounds silly is the Blue Angels and um I was having this debate with someone the other day about how much money the American government funds air shows uh and I was like that's totally worth it because whenever you go to one of these things you definitely feel a sense of patriotism and you're like this is awesome like this is like I'm in awe of this and and same way with going um going to the Moon um you know in the 60s and 70s we've we spent a significant amount of money on this uh a lot more than you would AR You could argue that we've spent on longevity which is actually a shame but we we you know there is a history in America of doing things just CA you know just to like Flex or just to like CBR us to but what was the last thing thought that we did it's been decades right it's been decades and I actually find it to be quite saddening and and that's actually sort of what you said is once you get to a point where you're financially secure uh on a human basis on a human level you do things uh for art for artistic reasons because it makes your soul feel good I I do wish we did that a little bit more as a country um but there was a period between like 1870 right post Civil War up to like 1960s or so right around when JFK passed like where there was this like Series in America America where we did a bunch of like interesting experiments where you could just say it was just C you know what I mean and I and I really appreciate that yeah I'm part of that is going to be regulation and then part of that is this odd post-modern cynical thinking right there's a very strong anti-progress movement in the US you know basically the idea is um you buy land and you construct giant monuments that are inspiring I don't know I mean it's pretty simple-minded but imagine if you walked out in San Francisco and you looked across you know to the The View with the the Golden Gate Bridge and Alcatraz and there's a giant statue that's kind of an ODed to the future why you have that how much of these things even cost you know the land it depends on where you do it and it depends on the regulatory framework um the land uh in in major metros tends to be the more expensive part of it actually versus the construction on a ratio basis and okay let's walk through an example what's one that you you fantasized about you're like okay what if we did this that would be cool I would be there was actually an island for sale in the bay um that ended up selling I can't remember for how much $29 or something just recently was that up by Stockton uh no it was in the bay it was actually in the in the in the water it was like a little island and um you know you you um it was on the market for a while I actually looked at it a couple times in terms of thinking H maybe this is a thing maybe this is an anchor thing but I just think it's going to be so hard to do anything in the Bay Area right I mean it's it's hard enough to construct a public toilet like are they really going to let you bu build a beautiful Monument uh right um on any reasonable time frame uh but there there's lots of other Metro areas that are much more amenable to this and there's a global version of this and there's a US version but often in in major metros it's the land and then the construction actually isn't that bad because really what you're building is a big statue and in some cases you're building out a base or Foundation under it that may be part of a building maybe you want to build an elevator up if you have a big view or Vista but you're not building a large commercial property with all the plumbing and electrical and you know all the extra stuff that goes into it right often these things are kind of like Hollow shells with and what would it be of like you know what's our equivalent of the Statue of Liberty or the Eiffel Tower that's like you know for just to demonstrate their their steel prowess like what do you think would be the modern equivalent that would have some meaning I think there's lots of stuff you can do I actually think um you know one of the things that the the intention around Monumental which is what we're calling the project uh is to also solicit ideas from people who live in locals and what do they want right what do they view as inspiring and what do they want to drive their children their children's optimism forward right this is in some sense an Ode to progress but more importantly it's a way to encourage the future how do you encourage inspiration and young people right how do you get people jazzed about the future and technology and optimism and doing things and Building Things and moving Society forward and I think part of this lack of ongoing societal Beauty and ongoing great works is a reflection of cynicism that to your point came in in the 60s and 70s and is really kind of spoiled the W well yeah I mean that's my that's one of my favorite erors to read about basically like in the mid-60s uh Malcolm X JFK RFK there's a b there's a series of assassinations and like one can argue that that was like the death of innocence in America and so it's like kind of like an interesting period to to to read about maybe I mean you look at all the stuff that happened in history before that a pretty awful stuff happened roughly every couple decades right I mean World War II was not a Happy Time World War I was not a happy time the Civil War was not you know there's a lot of [ __ ] that's gone down no doubt I feel like maybe the the Boomer self- internalized things in a different way because they were self-absorbed as a generation and so maybe for them it was a big moment but it just seems like there was just a shift there was some mindset shift and I maybe that is what it was attributed to I don't know what it's attributed to have you ever uh I don't know if you guys Sean you definitely have well maybe you have actually Sean driving to Duke do you guys ever remember seeing um all these crosses on the side of the highway in the South I bet Ari has but like you know there was this guy who was um he when he uh he was old and he had saved up roughly three or four million doar and he spent all of that money building crosses on the side of the highway now regardless if you like dig Christianity or not it doesn't matter but I always thought it was so interesting that like this guy dedicated that money to that if you you guys don't remember seeing this it was like a big deal in the South it would like you'd be driving to the South and every 50 or 100 miles you would just see this huge cross and that's all you saw or you would see these Billboards that says Jesus saves you you remember those yeah seen those I never understood what that is dude and it has a phone number that you could call and I would call that phone number every once in a while just to see what would happen and and at this point a lot of it goes to dead a dead phone number but it was basically a lot of it came down to this one man who had saved roughly $3 million and he spent it on that then other churches started following following it and started doing it and I always thought it was really interesting uh the idea of just spending money just for this cause and and your logical brain is like that's silly but then like your heart is like oh that's actually kind of an interesting idea how much of your own money would you spend on doing this Monument project um I don't know I mean I think it'd be good to try and get the first thing up and running and then you know do it as a joint effort with lots of people because again the hope is you actually feed the needs of local places um you know another example where I think there's this sort of craft craftsmanship applied uh there's a park in Oslo where um somebody spent I don't know was a decade two decades building statues in this one park it was an artist who went in and you just and you go in and it's all this consistent this consistent series of statues from one person right one artist who spent a big chunk of his life making them uh I think he made something like 200 sculptures over a few decades right and so there's other forms of this in terms of people people trying to contribute works and the question is why AR again why aren't we doing it like what happened what what happened to us Society to stop doing all this really inspiring amazing stuff yeah well I think the good news is it only takes one right like I think Elon showed that when when he started doing projects that none of the other entrepreneurs really wanted to do and no investors really wanted to fund and then it created this wave and it just kind of sparked inspiration where now a bunch of people do that right like I think the closest thing we have to that is like Tesla and SpaceX to be honest of of these like that's our moon mission right it's like wow this guy just poured his entire talent and net worth into these like super highrisk low probability you know useful for society hard but awesome projects and he pulled it off and you know that changed the wiring in every Founder's brain you know it doesn't even matter what you're doing you might be doing some boring insurance company but you still that example still lives in your brain right and I I think that's that's pretty powerful you're a pretty serious person you take serious like you you like you see problems and you're like I want to solve them is it what do you do just for shits and giggles like just to unwind before you have kids there's all sorts of things you do that the time goes away for once you have them but you know I used to do I don't to call it like intensive travel you know so I'd go to India for two months and do yoga for two months there with a guy who learned from a guy in a cave kind of thing or you know just just different forms of very immersive travel was one thing I used to do a lot lot of if somebody today had the freedom to do that what what would be your what's Gil's guide to uh to that intensive travel what would you tell what was really transformative for you or like what was your approach to that yeah I think it's basically um spend at least a month in one city and adopt decide to learn something there and so you know maybe you want to go learn how to draw or maybe you want to go to France and learn to to make pastries or maybe you want to you know in my case it was go to India and do this very int yoga experience or maybe you know and um especially if it's part of a community that you join you get really immersed in interesting ways and not just the topic but also the people around it and the local people right because then you're really forced to be part of something there's actually a a a person I know who was about to start a company and I convinced him to go do this because he had an extra month or two and he said it was like the best month he'd spent he went down to Brazil and um uh enrolled in some classes down the air and you just spent a month doing it and so I I personally think it's super interesting and how often in your life can you actually get a chance to do things like that but also it is a different form of travel than hey I'm going to um you know I went on a Chinese tour group of Italy once and on these Chinese tour groups they try to see as many cities as possible in as short a time as possible that's check the box right okay there's the Leaning Tower pza check we saw it it's like you stop for 10 minutes and then you run to the next thing you know that's very different from hey I'm just going to sit in one place for a month or two that's awesome uh yeah I've I've had great experiences doing that we used to go to Bren ireis for you know basically four to four to five weeks one live in one city live like a local and everywhere I would go I would do two things I would play basketball uh because that was like something I grew up doing so it was like a a native fluency I had even if I couldn't speak the language I could always kind of make my way in there but also I would go um if I ever travel with my brother-in-law he loves Jiu-Jitsu and I I'll never go with him to a Jiu-Jitsu class here in the States but Jiu-Jitsu has this like really intense camaraderie and openness and inclusiveness if you go to so we went to jiujitsu gyms in Spain and and you immediately feel like you're one of the people and you're learning from them and they have actually different techniques and again we don't even speak the language but man it's like an incredible fast way to bond or get actually feel like the jiujitsu community is one of the most vibrant ones right now along those lines yeah and to your point it's basically you go anywhere in the world and you plug in that's how this type of yoga I used to do was it was the same thing you just show up and you knew how it worked and everybody was kind of in the same uh they had the same Vibe and they were part of the same kind of crew like you were instantly adopted and my sense is that Jiu-Jitsu Community today is a good example of that where you just you show up you're instantly part of it they pull you in everybody has a common thing to talk about everybody has common interests in a really positive way even though it's a very diverse group around the world right um and there aren't that many communities like that and I think there's almost these interesting questions of like how did these form and why did they persist and and all the rest but this is back to my point on doing quote unquote a hobby or learning something that it's actually plugging into a community like that I think is important I love that I think of all the things we talked about today that was the most useful uh surprisingly right I wanted to learn about investing from you but I got a totally different Golden Nugget out of this where should people find you if they want more uh I guess they could find me on Twitter um you know I'm at a l Gill and then you know just uh hope more people go and build interesting things I think you know there's a lot to do we appreciate you great yeah thanks so much for the time all right well take care [Music]

Discord was one of those things that was probably overlooked cuz it was like mostly teenagers who play video games that were using this thing how is it going to make money it's not like slack where you can charge the company but the stat was people were spending like 7 hours a day on Discord just living in Discord it was their social life and so you're like well there's there's definitely something there and they were able to make a ton of money just even selling emojis at that point because if you have that much engagement you can't fake that

all right we are going to do an episode that uh people really liked before it was a trip report I did a a trip report when I went to Austin I just went to LA and I wrote down a bunch of notes so most people when they travel I don't think they really do this but I I call them micro memories where I just write down like one to three words that wouldn't make sense to anybody else but it there's a story behind it for me or there's something some insight some story some crazy thing that happen I write them down all trip and then what I did this time was I just published them on Twitter and I said uh hey here's all my notes ask me about any of these I wrote down 21 things why don't we try that Sam why don't why don't we take this list of 21 and you just pick numbers that you think are interesting and then I'll I'll kind of explain the thing the [Music] trick by the way when you take these notes where are you taking them like uh on your phone like you just have a running notepad on your phone so I have two I have notepad pen and paper that I take to everywhere I go and then I have also my phone in case I'm just like not there so Apple it just be Apple notes or that it's nothing fancy and you discard the notepad after it's done or you refer back to this like constantly most people come home and they unpack their bags I basically just unpack my notes my bag is actually still sitting over there it'll be there for three months but what I do is the very next day instead of saying oh I got to catch up on work and emails and slack and all this stuff the first two hours I basically just take my notes I I type them out and I try to squeeze you know 20 30 40% more juice out of the trip just by reflecting and being like okay what was that what was that story oh I should follow up with that person or what was the takeaway there and how am I going to implement that or um oh I need to sh this story I wanted to share with somebody let me write this and make sure I send it to that person um and so I take a couple hours first thing and I basically unpack my notes all right tell me about the low status technique for becoming a high status person at a conference all right so I went to reconvene which is a real estate conference and um met this guy there that I really lik this guy right away and then I just noticed that he was like probably the most popular guy there so there was maybe 200 people there 150 people there he was my favorite and I think it was everybody's favorite just based on the reaction I got and I was watching him and I was like what is this guy doing that has made him everybody's favorite person here I think that's what we all want we all want to be liked especially when we go to these you know big public events with strangers and he's a big fan of the Pod his uh his name is Will and he's got this Twitter account called student rent Pro I think is his name basically what this guy does is he owns a bunch of rental properties student housing like uh basically like houses for students in South Carolina so you know frat houses Roy houses just students living together he owns a bunch of properties there bootstrapped it no no outside investors that's what he does I'm talking to him he loves the pot as soon as I got there he makes a reference to the Pod from like he's like he he introduces me to somebody else he goes oh this is Sean he's real good friends with Orlando Bloom remembering this one or story said three years ago so I was like wow that was a that was a deep deep uh deep reference and he goes and so I'm watching him and I go how come everybody here loves you and he goes you know uh you said that thing when husten minhaj came on the podcast and he he shared this insight about comedy and this was before me and you were going to get on stage we were doing our first live show in Vancouver and I had texted hus in a picture of like 2,000 people in the audience and I was like dude give me some tips like how the [ __ ] are we supposed to entertain this crowd we're podcasters and he go and he said he goes start by talking about things you're see either you see there or you've seen in Vancouver just make a reference so that it's like I'm here you're not getting my Spiel you're getting me here right now presence he goes the second thing is uh comedy is a low status art form meaning self-deprecation make fun of yourself call yourself out poke fun at yourself that is how you connect with people and so this guy will goes he goes I stole that I stole that hard he goes I've been doing that you know once I heard that I really you know own that and so what he does at this event somebody would be like um so what do you do he'd be like oh man I have the um I do the hardest form of real estate that will pay you the least amount of money so you don't even want to talk to me you go talk to him he's he's awesome and then somebody's like what what does that mean he's like I do student housing but but tell me about and he's always making it about you or making it about somebody else and so he would make fun of himself if if anybody ever gave him a compl even when I called him you know the favorite guy there he was like oh thank you so much for saying that I'll be sure to disappoint you next time like he's just the master of this low status thing and he said he did this he's like uh he goes so I he when we're at the event he told me I stole that and he goes um I also use that on Twitter he goes everybody on here everybody in this conference at Twitter they just go on there brag about their returns and brag about how awesome they are brag about their method he goes I just did the exact opposite I'll go on there and I'll talk about how well today you know I'm I'm some 19y old's [ __ ] I gotta go I gotta go fix a toilet in a frat house right now you know wish me luck he's like I'm always talking about how bad my business is how hard it is how you know I don't envy any I don't envy myself like you know whatever he goes I just say it how it is and I'll say I'll actually shine a light on the worst parts of what it is and and the uncertainties of what I'm doing he goes but he goes I'll tell you what I think I can out he's like I've never raised any money but if I wanted to I think I could out raise everybody here because what I've been doing on Twitter has built a lot of connection and a lot of trust and I just think that goes a long way and then when I watched him at this conference he was doing something that Ben Le is a master of which is he realized that the way to build value at a conference is not to Puff your chest out and say oh hey come talk you know come look at me come talk to me about my great what he would do is any two people he would just connect them to each other and then he would basically get the Goodwill of having made that connection and he would just keep doing that and he'd be like oh this is Sean he'll never tell you this but his podcast is a huge deal this guy's a this guy's podcast is incredible you got to talk to him about this and Sean this guy he's we call him the multif family king of Dallas this guy's like the flavor flave of a conference he's just hyping people up he would just keep connecting people he would give you this like really hyperbole intro where he'd he'd be your hype man he'd make you feel good and he just kept doing that kept making connections kept giving people two ways to intersect oh you know you guys will get along because you're both really into X boom and what what that does is just creates this like enormous glue and Goodwill at a conference so you need people like this at a conference but also for him he actually ended up being the high status guy he's the guy that everybody loved he's the guy that everybody knew and he's the guy that everybody U sort of felt completely not on the defensive with and so because people felt they could be real with him they actually formed real connections to this thing I thought it was really awesome to see in person two things dinner with Millionaires and the Richer the guy the weirder the guyh okay the Richer the guy the weirder of the guy is a is an obvious one for me so what we do with these events is we kind of Stack meetings with a bunch of interesting people that live in that City so when we go to a city often Ben will say all right here's you know a bunch of our friends or a bunch of people we know or Loosely know you know who do we want to hang out with and how busy do we want to make this trip we we and we sort of Stack a schedule from there and one of the things that really stood out was the more successful the person the the Richer the guy the weirder the guy with really no exceptions during this trip and when I say weirder it would be that they have weird Hobbies it would have that they have weird marriages or relationship Dynamics it would be that they have just like really weird social skills and what I realized was that I always assumed by default that people are just normal chill just chill normal people right like I don't know like I just put that on people that was my default assumption and I realized like I really need to stop making that assumption because it is way way wrong when it comes to these kind of outlier successful people and I thought about that and I was like is it that like are they successful because they're weird or are they weird because they're successful and and I think there's a bit of both going on so like for example I think they are successful because they're weird and that they're willing to be unconventional like you know they didn't go get a job and they didn't they didn't look at some industry and assume it was like well run and they actually disrupted it and you know they grinded it out for 10 years taking no salary to try to get to that success so because they were willing to be unconventional in their career it really shouldn't surprise me that they're also unconventional in their marriage and unconventional in their Hobbies like what's an example well I don't want to say a specific story to make somebody feel weird right because these people listen to the podcast so it's not uh you know I I don't want to put them on blast like that but I mean you've you've seen this in San Francisco I have I think those particular people they tend to be on the coast in cities like La San Francisco and New York I know a bunch of people that are worth nine figures that live in Missouri where I'm from not a bunch handful and I think that they are shockingly actually normal I think it's if you've if you've gotten extremely wealthy at a young age and you live in one of these cities you're very you should assume that they're gonna be a freak you know what I mean yeah uh there's also just like rough edges so you know social norms are very weird right like we were at a breakfast and there was two people there and they didn't know each other and so we were like hey like you know um you know I could make an intro but it'd be easier you know you just tell your you you just intro yourself and like what I thought would happen if I say hey make an intro like Sam what are you going to say if I say just hey maybe you guys introduce yourselves you guys don't know each other two people I would say hey what's going on uh my name's Sam um I live on the east coast um I work in media the media industry and I work on a podcast I'm super into health and wellness great you said your name you say where you're from you say what you do and you say maybe something you're really into or kind of like a a hobby that's a big part of your life yeah totally normal chill thing to do at this breakfast one guy just starts with his name and literally he finished two minutes later with his company's eida and like the terms of their recent acquisition like the the and I was like what is going on I was like the I think rich people just like really really out of touch with what they are willing to share and overshare about their themselves but that happens I think that happens to you and I if they if they listen to the podcast and they realized that we talk about numbers a lot and what he was trying to do is to like either show off or impress you that yeah thought that this is just what you talk about all the time do you know what I mean yeah but you know and it wasn't bad like it was actually really fascinating it was interesting but I did note like wow that you know that's not a normal thing to do and I think that's you know what I enjoyed it in the moment but like and by the way the other person at the breakfast did the same thing I was like okay cool we all just went deep really fast which is weird but cool in in its own way so yeah the rich of the guy the weird of the guy all right so when I ran my company the hustle I think we had something like 2 million subscribers and we made money through advertising and we didn't actually make that much money per person reading the newsletter because advertising in general is kind of a crappy business model and so I remember sitting down and I'm like what are all the different ways that I can make money off the hustle that aren't advertising and so to make sure that you don't make this mistake Sean me and the hbot team we went and looked at a bunch of different ways to monetize your business and we put it all together in a really cool document Where We Lay It All Out along with our research and we we call it very appropriately we call it the business monetization Playbook go to the description of this episode and you're going to see a link to that uh business monetization Playbook it's completely free you just click the link and you can see it back to the episode what about um dressing well versus dressing comfortably okay this is right up your alley because I think you are on a a big dressing well kick not not not displayed today with your white T-shirt but you right this is like uh currently like a Fascination for you this is an $80 t-shirt Sean so is that an 80 t-shirt it's the t-shirt that the dude Jeremy wears in the bear so it's called fashion uh hello nothing like buying an $80 t-shirt and then have somebody else say is it an $80 t-shirt makees you feel great I apologize G fashion hello no like yeah you're speaking a language I don't even know that's the problem I I just can't even recognize I paid $80 this t-shirt so yeah I think I know thing or two about fashion all right so I mean obviously if you go to Los Angeles you're going to see a bunch of beautiful people and I started just like paying attention to it while I was there you know on the flight I was like man people really like dress beautifully for this flight like this is uh this is really cool and I remember that Paul Graham once wrote this essay called cities he says that every city is kind of whispering something in your ear all the major cities you know San Francisco is sort of whispering in your in your ear you're not ambitious enough you got to go bigger you know you you want to launch rockets or you know artificial intelligence whatever you're not ambitious enough and what does New York tell you they go uh you're not powerful enough they go uh you're poor yeah exactly you're not rich enough La basically Whispers you're not hot enough and this is why people are injecting all kinds of [ __ ] into their face and their lips and their butt and all all kinds of stuff and and to me that that part is a bit of a turnoff but I do appreciate the the dressing well component of you're not hot enough and the funniest part was I went and our buddy suly lives in LA right now and I saw suly a few months ago when he was living in San Francisco the guy transformed dude he went from like SF startup Scrappy style to cool guy La Chic and not even like in a try hard way just casual right like just very casual but well-dressed casual and I was so inspired by it I was like wow this is my same friend two different cities comes across two different ways just by you know a couple of choices and I literally was just like he was like explaining to me I was like shut up I just looked at his tag I took photos of his shirt while he was wearing it I was like I'm buying this exact outfit and that'll be my starting point and I realized okay you know I I've had this in my mind this Choice which was either dress comfortable or dress nice it's one of the other it's not but when I saw him I was like oh he's comfortable and R like duh that was a false Choice stupid story I was was telling myself that was dumb pretty easy to change this um and I remember 10 years ago I actually hired a stylist in San Francisco to come to my house and she threw away all of my clothes she took everything out of my closet and she took me shopping for one day and we bought a whole bunch of new stuff and it was like three grand to do it and it was great but that was 10 years ago and like you know since then I have like gone back to my old ways and I've copied many things from suie in life mostly business stuff but this is a something else I'm going to copy from him which is to uh you know do a very simple upgrade of style here do you know why you thought that dressing well is the opposite of comfortably it's just because your [ __ ] didn't fit right if you if you wear like you can wear really nice clothes like as much as a tie and a nice shirt if it fits well it's not uncomfortable I think that do you do you value art at all like does art talk to you ever like do you ever feel feel inspired by Beauty like or in what in what form does it do do you find like inspiration yeah not paintings but NE you know things if they're like beautifully simple designs right like a lot of like furniture or interior design like a space which is kind of like like interior design of a space to me is like it just really stands out if I walk into a space that's got a certain Vibe it's like I don't know it's just like I can't pay attention to really anything else in that moment because I know that that same space with just a different set of you know lights and furniture and plants and whatnot would feel completely different same shell you know know somebody has created this Vibe so I I agree I like architecture and I like energy of a room in furniture and for years I thought art just meant like paintings or like just like scures sculptures and I don't find inspiration from those things and I thought architecture or clothing that's not art that's a waste of time that's a waste of energy and then when I kind of like realized I'm like no it's actually like just as important as art it's not a waste and I started giving into that feeling I realized it this is this is what makes Like This Ss to my soul I should like give into this stuff and it's worth the effort this isn't you know it's not simply utility it could also be something that just is in inspires me or just sings to me a little bit and so once I realize that they're all it's all related to self expression and it's all art it kind of change my perspective do you know what I mean or instead of just saying instead music is like that right music music is probably the easiest one to appreciate yeah and it's and instead of saying well I'll just pay someone to do this I actually realize no I want to learn like the I want to learn like what are these things communicating or like what goes like it is in a weird way in art I don't want to just phone it in I want to actually figure out like what makes be beautiful art or what language do I want to speak when I'm communicating this do you know what I mean yeah I'm also probably the only sucker that bought two nfts because I was like oh that's beautiful art and I didn't mean it as like the cover your ass of like I'm just trying to get rich was that the holographic uh Kobe Bri thing the Kobe the Kobe uh the Kobe floating into heaven one and the there other one that's just a strawberry I was like wow this is beautiful and I bought this strawberry nft that uh you know is currently worth zero but in my heart it's still worth something um all right let's go to one or two more things I which one do you think is interesting okay I think the little luxuries in life uh is a good one I think Mike Posner is a good one and yeah I want to learn about him but that ruin the Pod no it won't ruin the Pod all right so you interviewed Mike poster I've KN I know Mike poster because of his song like I took a pill and AA was like the biggest hit I think but then I also know him because he's kind of like a hippie mellow guy I read about him or watched a YouTube video about him walking across America and so like he's actually a little bit more gury not that he's a self describe that but I am looking to him as like an energy Guru a little bit is that right yeah I wouldn't call him energy Guru but I know exactly what you mean which is that he's an inspiring guy so the the backstory here is um I went to Duke and in my freshman year I heard that there's a guy in the dorm next door who's like some white guy rapper from Detroit and I was like okay cliche um and it turns out that that was Mike poster he's in the same year as I was and he lived you know one building over and I remember hearing his songs before they ever went public and you know for example um cooler than me which was his first kind of hit song I remember hearing that and being like okay this is actually kind of catchy but at the time it just seemed far-fetched to me like yeah just guy's really going to make it and he wasn't the best rapper and he wasn't the best singer and all that stuff so you know at the time we just sort of wrote him off and then while we were at Duke he blew up I think the second or third year Cooler Than Me took off and we used to hear that this guy was traveling like every weekend he would just go do shows concerts at other campuses and he' fly back he' fly out on Thursday he fly back Sunday night and he's there on Monday for classes and I remember being like what the hell and like he had a meeting with Jay-Z's record label and I was like wow this is crazy what's going on so anyways that was how I initially heard of Mike poster and over the next I don't know 10 15 years he went on this journey where it was like a perfect threea story which is kind of ironic because when I did the podcast I didn't cover any of the story as you normally would so he is like a podcaster dream he's got a perfect three-act story it's the rise you know the unlikely rise of this college you know musician in his dorm room who you know becomes international pop star then he's got act two the fall which is he's a one hit wonder his next song goes triple platinum but it's still not enough CU it's smaller than the first song then the next song goes double Platinum which is even worse and then his record label shelves him and he doesn't get even get to make music anymore they won't release his music anymore for years and he like a does he also get into drugs and alcohol or no he gets depressed he's like I live this lifestyle you know I was on the road I'm taking my shirt off on stage I'm the man now I'm not the man anymore and he's kind of bummed out and he hits Rock Bottom when he goes to a concert with his friend aichi the kind of the one friend of the music industry who didn't write him off as like it has been and he's now in general admission he's in the crowd and he's like I'm watching my friend on stage doing the thing I used to do the thing that I want to do which is you know like do this concert in front of thousands of of fans who love him I'm sit I'm standing in the crowd just like a normal civilian and he's like I'm hoping that somebody recognizes me and then if somebody does they come up to me they go hey are you Mike Posner he's like then I realized that was my worst nightmare cuz they're like what are you doing here like why are you in the crowd he's like and then I take a like this guy offers me a pill and I take it and that becomes That Rock Bottom is the the Genesis of the song I took a pill and ABA to show aichi I was cool the first line of that song yeah that becomes the new hit so hits Rock Bottom ends up making a hit even bigger than the first one two billion streams on Spotify and then again feels a bit depressed cuz like is this what I want out of life and is I'm just chasing this high this Fame high and that's when his dad dies and he now act three the rebirth and this is where he ends up doing a bunch of things he climbs Everest and he with his friend he actually climbed 71 mountains to prep for Everest and he has this quote you know you train for climbing a mountain by climbing mountains and he go climbs 70 mountains he ends up climbing Everest he then decides to walk across America after his dad dies he walks across two-thirds of the way he gets bit by a rattlesnake almost dies has to relearn how to walk after he months of therapy where he relearns how to walk goes back to the spot where he got bit and resumes the walk and finishes it and anyways he's become this very happy positive upbe guy now he's he's sober he doesn't do drugs he doesn't drink um he doesn't watch porn he like sings about songs that he he just wants to make art that inspires people cool so he's got this like amazing story I do this podcast where I talk about almost none of it and the reason why was he's told that story before and I'm in the season of sort of indulging my actual Curiosities it's like let me have the the conversation actually want to have and so I talked to him about you know how do you actually make the songs that you make like what is the creative process for you like where does a pit song come from how do you do that and a lot of his mindset mentality stuff so I think the podcast is going to be great but it's different than than probably what people expect which is just kind of beginning middle and end of his story with someone like him who is famous but maybe doesn't regularly have hits or a tour does how does he just have super lumpy income I mean how does he like survive between well so what he told me he was like um I was like how did you do that and he's like well part of it is like I got Financial Freedom like he's like my like wealth manager guy sat me down and was like hey we ran Monte caros simulations and like look like you're good you're good you're good and so like you of course you can always make more and of course like you know anything could happen but like by and large you're good if you don't let your lifestyle get [ __ ] crazy you're you're all right he's like so then that gave me the freedom of like I don't even need need to have another hit right which fre which is like all of his hits have come from a place where he wasn't trying to make a hit and every time he's tried to make a hit he didn't make a hit right it's like that irony of of the whole thing and so um I go to his house and by the way the best thing to do with these podcast is to go to people's house to film it was it nice well we filmed it in his Studio which is like a side house that he has like we didn't go to the main house but it's cool it's at the top of this mountain so you have to like basically make a trek up this like windy road up to his mountain and I was like cool I'll you know I'll pass on this windy road every day but but the house itself was cool it was at the top of this mountain and I'm standing there at the studio he's he's like oh his guy was like oh he's got he's got a meeting right now he he'll be out in a second so he comes out and I just hear from the other side like woohoo like he's just so happy that he's like outside enjoying his day he doesn't even realize that we're already there and he's just like oh you're here and then he comes in and he's just like a ball of Good Vibes it's like energy was really like off the charts and you could people don't know this but uh already we've talked about this which is we get to see the guest before the lights turn on and after the recording is over and it's very striking what people are like some people have a very stark contrast of the before pod and after F pod versus when they're recorded and some people are just like the same or even better when they're off camera I would say Mike was a great example of somebody who off camera like his energy was just very very contagious extremely positive person very nice to everybody in the room room took the time to do that even afterwards when he had to go like his manager was there was like Hey we got to go Mike we're late you we got to go somewhere he like stopped and was like hey um he's like I gotta go do this real quick but I don't leave I want to come back and say bye which like most musician pop stars don't give a [ __ ] right they don't need to come back and say goodbye they they're just like yeah thanks everybody by like see I'm on to my next important thing because remember I'm a very important person and instead he was like made you feel important which I thought was did he remember you from Duke well we didn't actually ever really cross paths like we didn't know each other when we were there we just knew I knew of him he didn't know anything about me all right let's do uh one or two more what's the little luxuries so this stood out we like again we meet a bunch of people one of the things we noticed was we would have a like a meeting or lunch or something or hang out go to someone's house who was like super wealthy and what we notic was like man even if this person has like let's say 10 times the net worth that we have they don't have like 10 times the better life they don't even have maybe two times the better life I actually don't think that there's really like any link and I don't mean better life as in like let's say their health or their family like forget those things I'm talking about even just material life like there's not that much that they can spend on that we really need um or would want so we you know and I'm on the lookout for it like what are ways that people use money either spend money invest money whatever that is interesting to me and what I noticed was that there were very few luxuries that I actually wanted that other people people had and instead well we we we flipped it and there was actually some really small little luxuries of life so like when we were I was talking to Ben and Ben's like dude there's this little luxury of life I I I miss at this Airbnb he's like the Airbnb had really cheap towels he's like yeah he's like I just recently splurged on like having amazing bath towels he's like and then I use two every time he's like it drives my wife nuts I'll use two towels every time I had a shower and like I bought the like $40 towel or the $50 towel instead of the like $5 towel he's like but it's the little luxuries man and I was like dude that's me with socks like I will like I hate having mismatched socks so I threw all my socks away when we got acquired the only thing I bought was I threw all my socks away and I asked I said what is the highest quality sock and I just that you can find what's the answer by the way well the answer I got at that time was bomas socks and now I actually have like custom socks so I went to a manufacturer and I was like hey I I want a sock like this and uh so now I have like 100 100 200 pairs of custom manufactured socks over there Factory that I I found off Alibaba yeah because I like wearing crew socks like you know like the kind of calf like like socks whatever calf length socks midaf and um but like if you wear the Nike compression ones they're too tight all the time and if you just wear the H ones they're like kind of uh they're good but they're they're pretty basic and so I kind of made my own hybrid do you know that gen Z makes fun of Millennials for wearing ankle socks good I knew fascia would come back around and be on my side I've been a dork for a long time wearing non- ankle socks you've been winning you win this one uh young people don't like ankle socks they like socks that show so you're right you and like skinny jeans are not cool either right like you got to wear like big jeans or something high-waist jeans yeah uh baggie and high-waisted pants are in thank God because they're way more comfortable by the way way more comfortable but they call it uh the word is called Choy so when you are like uh a 35-year-old that you wear skinny pants or skinny jeans it's called you're being Choy that's like the the phrase how do you use it in a sentence like you're being Choy or he is yeah you could do that yeah you could use it that way or you could say like I don't want to wear skinny jeans that's that's pretty Chuky uh you could use it that way but yeah Choy means like uh like for examp yeah so uh tight jeans ankle socks it's super Choy you don't want to be Choy man all right well that's that's it that was my La trip report I had 21 things we talked about a few of them all right that's the pod [Music]

double or nothing coffee it's a coffee shop where instead of at the end where it's like do you want to tip 20% 30% whatever it just says double or nothing and it's basically you flip a coin and it's either going to be a free coffee or you're going to pay double for it and the double goes to the Baristas why is this a great idea a coffee really only costs a coffee shop like 40 cents or something let's say the price of the coffee was 4 bucks if they can get eight bucks out of every other customer here on this coin flip that's a lot of extra dollars coming through the till and worst case scenario you're just giving up a free coffee it's only cost you 40 cents in the downside so it's double or nothing but I didn't say it's 5050 it's actually going to be more like a 7030 chance of upang double

all right Sam I got to tell you about this there is a guy in Japan who I read about who is making $80,000 a year for doing [Music] nothing they called him the do nothing man have you ever heard of this guy no where'd you read about this well I originally saw it I don't even know where I saw it somewhere and I was fascinated because what happened is this guy was at work and his boss called him a do nothing man and he like was insulting him as like dude you you just do nothing you don't really add anything you don't provide any value and he says that he thought to himself and he goes H is there value in society for a man who does nothing and he went online and he posted a tweet saying I'm I'm starting a new service it's called rental people who do nothing and it's basically was like I will be a companion a friend who will do nothing so what this guy does is you rent him out and he'll go hang out with you and he says nothing it's pretty much a silent companion completely non-physical nonsexual basically an introvert for hire and so what people do is they will either they have a task they need to go do like an errand they need to run or they just feel really lonely and they just want somebody to have some tea with them and he'll come and he'll sit he won't really say anything and if you ask what question he'll give you a simple answer but it's really just the presence of another human body and this guy made $80,000 in a year renting himself out and he then he wrote a book A Memoir called rental people who do the man who didn't did nothing or rental people who do nothing and he's continued to do this now for years so he did it before covid then Co hit so he couldn't do it and then he started it back up again and now he doesn't even charge for the hangout he used to charge $68 for a session and now he just says just cover the food and travel and then I'll hang out with you for free and so he travels around and he gets paid to go he gets paid for his food and his his his event tickets and all all the things that people want to do with him and uh this is what this guy does isn't this fascinating what I'm I'm reading the uh comments on his Goodreads account for his book what were the reasons why people wanted to hang out with him well so this was pretty fascinating so I was wondering this too I was like why is there a need for this and I guess in Japan there's a loneliness epidemic it's kind of crazy they have words for this that we don't even have words for so have you ever heard this term like hikori you know I haven't I have not heard that term has it come up in Connecticut no I've not heard that word before that's a new word for me so it's a word that they have for severe social withdrawal it's total withdrawal from society so typically it's kind of like incel in the states so typically it'll be a it's mostly men who are living at home still in their parents' home but they are completely reclus they don't work they don't socialize and there are like estimated two million men in Japan that are in this category for six months they basically have not engaged with anybody in society so that's like kind of one problem is this growing trend of hikori and then there's another word I think it's kodokushi which is uh it's basically death without being cared for so it's like older people who are dying and then they find their bodies like five months later because they were so socially isolated that nobody knew that they passed away and this is like a number that the last 10 years has doubled like I think 70,000 people died this way where they're found weeks or months later and these Trends are all like very concerning so like in Japan single person household so you know no no wife no no family members no friends just living alone by yourself is now 38% of the population which is it was that's like triple where it was I know five or seven years ago they appointed a minister of loneliness in Japan because this has become such a big problem and so this guy doing this is almost like a an art statement in a way about this to bring awareness to this huge problem that people are just really freaking lonely in Japan everywhere but really in Japan it's even more heightened dude let me explain something to you that's very similar to this and I'm GNA I want to hear your opinion of this premise that I have and I also I think it's a good premise I think a lot of people can learn from so I I don't live in Austin anymore I went and visited it again for a wedding and I realized how lucky I was to have a community there of just the the best people on earth I consider them family dude I saw your live laugh love post where you posted a picture with your friends and you said this is wealth and I thought he's not wrong he's not wrong but he's also not Sam par what is going on this is wealth what new era have you entered I've I've entered a very special and let me listen it's weird ever since having a kid the things that I thought I cared about I don't care about as much and so I real I'm kind of like going all into this like emotional side of like caring about others whatever all that stupid [ __ ] yeah uh but listen so we like can't even say it it's like hurts to say the sentence but we believe it yeah so before uh so I basically lived in San Francisco and I moved from San Francisco to Austin my best friend at the time Neville madora he lived there and I had this conversation with him before I moved I go Neville I'm thinking about moving to Austin one of the big Reasons I'm moving is because of you I want to be with you I want to be near you would you be willing to I want to be in you I want to be in you you could say you could say I know you going with that one yeah it goes a better way than than that one way uh and so uh if I do this would you like commit to like us like living a life together like with our families and like and that sounds weird but I did that and it worked wonderfully so we had there was about four other couples where we had this conversation where we're like let's live life together like you can count on me I'll count on you whatever and when you think about that that's strange but if you really dive deep it's actually not that weird because that's what you did with your girlfriend probably like you're like Hey so uh should we put a label on this you know what I mean and you do a girlfriend a boyfriend and then you make a huge ordeal to where you uh get engaged you get down on one knees and there's like a a there's like a big like epic thing where like were boyfriend and girlfriend now you are officially a fiance and then you get married where you basically you know talk about you take a vow in front of people who have flown from around the world to witness this vow and that's normal but we don't really do that with friends and so I've recently moved in order to be closer to family and so now I'm trying to like develop friends in a new town and I'm starting to go to them and I'm having this formal conversation and it it it really weirds people out uh right away by the way obviously but after a few minutes the men in in particular they're like oh I kind of get this and kind of feels nice it kind of feels nice to like talk about how we're going to do life together how we can counter on each other or like to set uh you know to define the relationship you're saying let's let's let's make this real so what are you actually saying so here's what I'm saying what I'm saying is what this guy about uh in in Japan is experiencing is this lonely thing and you're talking about people living by themselves uh 38% of the time talk about people dying and for weeks not being Found What I'm saying is I think a lot of people experience loneliness and I think one key way to uh get over it particularly men men in particular once they approach their 50s and 60s you basically never make a new friend again uh just like you never go to the doctor you don't go to the dentist and you don't make new friends but I think there are ways around this and it's around having these formal conversations and in particular one extreme example is to move places just for for the sole reason of like this friend being there do you know what I mean I know exactly what you mean uh but I guess what I'm saying is what is the conversation you're having with people especially new people so I get the the Neville one because he was already a really close friend from s you guys he was in San Francisco right that's where you guys originally became friends no he would spend his summers in San Francisco uh and we would like hang out and then he would go back to Austin because Austin was unbe you guys were already really close and you're like hey I want to move there and I really like I'm kind of moving there for you or I want to move right really close to you and like let's do life together and I'm a big fan of this I've said this before one of the most impactful things that's come out of this podcast was a guy named Mike Brown came on the Pod and he said um I was asking about going into business with his brothers and he goes That's to me that's the point of life you find the people you love and you do life with them and that became like a a very simple operating Philosophy for me so I I'm a definit Believer in that what are you doing now with new people because I'm curious how that conversation goes when it's not somebody you've already been friends with for for five or 10 years I've only done it once so far far and I just kind of like I hope they're listening dude it's weird like it's definitely like it's definitely weird but i' like hey so um you know I'm looking to like have like close friends who I can rely on and I want to let you know that like you are that to me right now where uh I hope I can rely on you for important things and I want let you know that you can rely on me for stuff and like whatever I have it's you can use whatever I have I got your back no matter what and I know this sounds weird and everything but I'm looking to do like with someone and it seems like you and your wife might be that person for me and my wife and I make jokes about it and I realize how silly this sounds but it was actually really great it did me feel really good this is like how swinging starts um so so actually I have a a sort of related story one time I was doing a a a angel investment a deal by the way we need we need a word for this you were saying in Japan they have a word for we need a Japanese word for it we need a Japanese word for this because when you don't have words to label these things we need to define this word it's got to be explicitly heterosexual explicitly not involving swinging it's got to be like some type of reciprocity or like I'm willing to give more than 50% to this relationship do you know what I mean like this idea of like a good relationship you had be willing to overg give so I just went into Google translate I wrote male friends that don't have sex and it says sukusu noo Tomodachi so I think that's the current phrase for it Tomodachi for short um [Music] all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think all right what we saying about Angel Investing so I was I was trying to do an angel investment this was maybe I don't know 12 years ago or something and I had no money and I wanted to invest in this company and I'd finally realized like oh I have friends who have money and I could probably go to them and I could probably pitch them a deal and if they do the deal they'll probably give me a little piece of the of the of the upside if it works out and so I go to a friend I go to my buddy suie and I say um hey I want to invest in this company he's like all right great let's do it and he's like cool so for the economics of this like how do you want to do this and I was like I I don't really know what's the norm he's like well the norm is probably this where you would get you know like 10 15% of my carry but you know we could do whatever you want and I was like well you know I just want to make sure you're you know it's fair I was kind of thinking transaction I was like I just want to make sure this is fair like I don't want to I don't want this to be you know one sided or the other and he goes let's make it one-sided in your favor and he goes I don't care what happens on this deal what I care about is us doing deals together for the next 20 years and first of all it was not just Hollow words cuz he was giving more action on the deal to me he did not need to uh I wasn't asking for it he just per you know did that on on on his own the second was the way he signaled that like hey I'm looking for 20 years of doing stuff together was kind of intentional and new in a way that I hadn't really uh heard and then I started doing that with other people so when I met up with Ben and I was like Ben hey you want to do this project together he's like yeah we did a project together it went great want to do another project together we did another project together it went great and I was like hey let's start a business together but I what I told him was I was like I think you're awesome and I think we work really well together I want to like I want to be in business with you for 20 years so let's basically only make decisions that will increase the likelihood of us doing this together for 20 years and that really changed the game so that one little way of being intentional that this I want this relationship to go beyond this transaction this this moment in time and saying like I think you're awesome and I want to be doing stuff with you for a long time that has really uh helped me or changed the way that I viewed things but also the way that other people receive it because then they know they they know that I'm putting my foot forward and saying yes I think you're awesome and I could see us doing plenty of things together let's do this for the Long Haul which I think settles everybody down and gets everybody out of a sort of selfish or short-term uh mindset just bu of guys being dudes you know that's what it comes down to we just it's just much of us guys we want to be dudes you know baby tomoi okay let us be Bros celebrating that um okay so here's some I guess like related things to this so uh so back to this guy by the way this show G moroto so this guy 39 years old look at his Twitter his Twitter has 420,000 followers he's gotten like very famous off of this he said that before Co he was making $300 a day so he's doing this $68 a session what whatever and he was just going to coffee shops and playing video games and doing you know random stuff with each other dude he's hard it's Twitter's it's hard to these Japanese I tell you what they got a different word for [Laughter] everything okay so uh his service is called rental people who do nothing so I started thinking do we have this here because loneliness is not a only in only a Japan thing obviously it's everywhere and actually there are some things like this so go to rentafriend.com I don't know if you've ever seen this no you know what Sean I'm proud to say I haven't actually been on this website yet friend seeking friend okay so now type in like just type in San Francisco and click search and then you're going to see just like a huge list of totally platonic friends who are down to hang out and just have a day together it's pretty wild that there's this whole I didn't even know this existed it's Craigslist for friends it's pretty pretty cool right and it actually has a lot of traffic you know this is a little sus there's a lot of pretty women with full body shots on here yeah this might be like I found laundromat and I'm like this place is doing a huge amount of business and it's like well it's not just a laundromat right like they're laundering other things besides clothes here so I I don't know exactly the the social norms here but I'm going to take it at face value that this is rent a friend that this is truly for for friendship and I've read some articles of people doing this and what they said was they were like you know it was actually in some ways kind of nice to have just someone on demand that I could go do this thing with maybe a plus one for an event or to go to a concert together or whatever it is didn't want to go by myself but I still wanted to go they were like but the other side of it was it had this like weird dynamic was like wait by the way does rent a friend mean I pay them money yeah you pay the money to hang out Sean this is like where you get a hooker this is like there's Valerie on here is like in a bikini and she's 20 and like really good-looking it might be but I read this article on like whatever Vox or whatever Somebody went went and they did this so they rented a friend on this site and so they what they said was they were like yeah it was uh you know I paid for this person to come hang out with me they're like you know one of the things and they talk to them about like the other jobs that they've done they're like yeah it's a lot sometimes for older people or it's for you know somebody who's you know just sort of been very busy with work hasn't really developed their social life and one of the things that they talked about was like it made me a more rude person because they're like oh if I'm paying you then this is all on my terms I'm gonna we're going to do what I want we're gonna and they're like there was some downsides to like there's upsides of wow this companionship on demand and on the other side there was some downsides which was like the power dynamic was off you know I was too aware at least the journalist was like I was too aware of the the the the differentiation so that's one one business there's another one that you've probably heard of called Papa you know papa no it's Papa this is for your grandparents so it's basically a lot of people have you know grandparents who are alone both they're both lonely but also kind of need help like maybe little errands that they can run or somebody to help them when they're going to the store just in case anything happens or to make you know a little easier to move around and this was a Silicon Valley startup that was basically like you pay for you pay for basically like a task rabbit specifically to help older people and it's something less than kind of like a live-in live-in Care but it's more than you know me once a month calling my grandparents and so that's uh this company was I remember when this came out it was sort of this crazy idea and it was backed by some investors I remember Alexis aan the guy who created Reddit he backed it he said something like uh you know there's 11,000 you know Boomers that are are retiring like every day or something crazy like that some some huge number and he's like that you know our our aging population is growing very fast and we're going to need services that are going to help them and this company's valued over a billion dollars holy I'm looking at their funding they've raised hundreds of millions uh$ 250 million 250 million yeah soft Bank put a bunch of money into them and they were valued at 1.4 billion and it's literally a sort of like OnDemand companionship for older people dude have you ever met a sugar baby have I ever met a sugar baby I think I have but I I don't know if it was like official or if it was just like a uh like you know there's like this the website where it's like this is an official Arrangement and then there's like you know just the they just happening in the wild so I I think I just met someone who is happening in the wild so there's sugar daddy.com where you like go and you meet someone and it gets a lot of traffic and I was talking got to go Incognito for this one let me just make sure I don't get targeted for ads for the rest of my life I was talking to my wife about this the other day cuz she uh uh somehow knew someone who was a sugar baby or or and I think there's like reality TV shows about it too which yeah you definitely have seen because you guys have like the same TV taste uh but but I actually think that this is like a fairly fair trade uh as long as it's consensual obviously but I'm I'm shockingly on board with having a sugar baby like if you're if you're an old guy and you just want to and like a lot of these guys they literally just want a companion they just want someone to be there for them and things like that and it's not always like you know as weird as it sounds it's no different than wanting to rent this Japanese guy to come hang out with you yeah and you know I don't really have any judgments on this like I don't I've never experienced this I don't really know the lifestyle I try not to be you know too judgmental things I don't really understand what I'm fascinated by is just this phenomenon and again like uh I remember when first moved to Silicon Valley I met the guy who was the first pm at Twitter um and I asked him I was like man that that's amazing you picked Twitter really early on there was only 14 people there or something like that at the time how' you know like was was it obvious that Twitter was going to be a big deal he goes no everybody thought Twitter was weird stupid useless just like a strange thing to do and he goes well I remember when I joined somebody asked me why did you join he goes because you can't deny the phenomenon meaning When You observe people doing a behavior that kind of makes no sense or seems odd seems strange seems weird to you the natural in inclination is to push that away and be like oh that's that's stupid that's weird and you sort of resist it and he goes as an investor or somebody you know in in where where we worked in the technology space you want to lean into the phenomenon you want to understand wow why is it that people are watching other people play video games twitch right why is the people are just texting out to a random group group of strangers what they're having for lunch Twitter why is it that people are getting into strangers cars instead of taxis Uber right like why are people are sleeping on other people's couches instead of hotels Airbnb all of the biggest winners tended to be these weird behaviors things that's you know either broke a social Norm or sounded a little sketch and once you sort of wrap that into you know a more uh safe and acceptable behavior it unlocked a pretty big market and so I've always tried to have I've tried to learn to have a more open mind about this stuff and so would I be surprised if the way that getting into people's you know sleeping on couches or getting into stranger cars like would I be surprised if companionship as a service like totally nonsexual companionship as a service was a big deal I would absolutely not be surprised because I think that probably by default most people are are lonier than they want yeah and I actually think that this is not a new phenomenon I think that that it's a phenomenon it's a thing that's always existed now let me get let me get biblical on your ass I was I was uh raised Catholic so I went to Catholic School my whole life so I had to read the Bible all the time did you ever read the the story about Jesus and he was like carrying the cross up like the hill or something to like you know to be executed no I didn't read that one well yeah yeah I don't know it's like part of culture a little bit uh but like there's a at one point there's like a line where like these professional women or these women who are professional uh I think they call them Whalers but basically these women who are hired to come cry at a funeral to grieve to make you feel like you're not the only uh one there to grieve for this person um and like he like dismisses them and he's like you know don't don't give me get this out of here uh get his direct quote was like get that nonsense out of this out of here something like that no but I actually think that is a thing at funeral home by the way uh funeral homes where like you have like a griver who will come and and make and fill the room you know what I'm saying but these types of things have been around forever and so I don't actually think it's particularly a new phenomenon I think we've always felt this way now there's just interesting platforms to help solve the problem right right it's like those uh there's like these marketplaces now online to rent a crowd it's like oh you need a a crowd people who either love you or protesting you push this button you'll I'll get you 30 30 people in a crowd today right and you know politicians use this and brands use this like it's a it's a it's a easy technology made it easier to coordinate um by the way there's a great tweet have you seen it where he's like uh hey I'm willing to show up looking like a mob boss at anyone's funeral just so your friends of family feel like man you really had some [ __ ] going on that they didn't know about dude I bet you the uh Renta friend CEO or like company they're listening to this podcasts and they're like oh that's so cute Sean thought that we were just so you could meet friends and not for prostitutes friends is in air quotes a yeah by the way if it's not friends that's just me being me naive old me just sucker for for for uh for whatever you tell me okay I believe in humanity there's hundreds of thousands of people right now collectively saying a can I um can I tell you about another thing that I saw that I think you might have seen as well because it happened at a UFC event a few weeks ago and I've been meaning to talk to you about this yeah what did you see at the recent I think it was at the sphere event did you see a very interesting advertisement on one of the on the post during the UFC are you familiar with what I'm talking about I saw what you were talking about but I don't know enough to like Riff on it I mean explain it and then maybe I'll remember I'm watching the UFC pay-per-view and it's their first event at the sphere uh in Las Vegas and I heard you bought tickets for it yeah that's another story how I uh I actually ended up paying $115,000 to not go to the sphere of which is a a big L for me wait you paid 15 grand for tickets so speaking of friends uh I was like hey let me buy tickets for the sphere event I heard Dana White talking about it and I was like oh wow he says this is a one andone it's going to be something like you've never seen before blah blah blah so months ago I just go online and I buy six tickets to the sphere I think it was like after The Ticket Master Fe was like 25 27 Grand or something like that oh my God all right and then I emailed a bunch of people who I haven't hung out with uh either ever or recently and I was like hey uh do you want to come to this event and they were like yeah this is awesome and so some some of them said yeah some of them said I I'll try let me let me see if I can make it work because it was still months out and then a bunch of things happened two of the people couldn't make it for like medical reasons um the card for the sphere got way worse than it was supposed to be it got way worse I myself had just gotten sick like the two weeks prior to it and so like had just come off of like not being helpful at home to like oh wait now I'm going to go on a trip to Las Vegas after this not really the best game plan for me and the ticket prices dropped like crazy so we ended up selling the tickets for like you know a third or something of whatever I paid for them so yeah not not a good win for me but uh a great story that I got to tell here so that was that anyway so then I'm watching it on TV and I see on the post behind one of the fighters that says invest like a politician and invest like a politician like what is that that is a kind of an amazing hook and I realized oh this is that app that um I've been following for a little while this guy Chris he's behind this app called autopilot and he came and he he went on Twitter and he explained this thing that they were doing this stunt that they did around the UFC so they they sponsored the invest like a politician but they did a lot more than that I just think it a badass marketing stunt that I want yeah he did like the the Tesla the cybertruck uh stuff check out this thread so uh look at the photos in this and if you're listening on audio go to YouTube and watch this thing because you got to see the clips of this all right so what they did was they hired so I guess the premise of autopilot I should say is it's a investing app but it's kind of like you basically pick who you want to follow their portfolio and you will invest it's like let's say I wanted to just mimic Warren Buffett's portfolio or I want to mimic you know some famous Traders portfolio I could do that one of the traders that they is Nancy Pelosi who everybody kind of knows is uh you know a legend a legendary traitor in her own right and so what they did was for the sphere event they found a fake Pelosi impersonator do you see her there uh they find her on Tik Tok and they hire her and they put her through hair and makeup and then she she goes to they fly her to Vegas and she goes to the event and before the event she starts interacting with all these influencers so they go get Mike from uh you know the impulsive podcast yeah and she's hanging out she's playing blackjack with Mike and then she meets up with the nek boys and the NK boys are like holy [ __ ] it's Pelosi they're playing blackjack with her and then she gets um then she's in the crowd when sugar shano Ali walks out and she's in this hot pink pants suit power power pant suit like Pelosi and it gets freeze framed and everybody's like holy [ __ ] is Nancy Pelosi at the UFC and all these people are tweeting about this and she doesn't look like her at all this model or actress is way better looking it's like hot PL it's actually kind of like Sarah Palin and Pelosi together what they got CU n pel is like 80 years old or something so yeah this woman looks is like legitimately a model but go ahead so then they got a truck a cyber truck and they wrapped it and it says Pelosi 2024 and it says invest like a politician autopilot and they drove this around Las Vegas getting just honked at and there's all these like Tik toks of people taking videos of this Pelosi 2024 thing and if you look at Google Trends they go from like nobody searching for them to like you know it spiked and hit 100% interest on that day of the event and basically they were like yeah we just took a risk spent a bunch of money on this and uh let's give it a go and I just thought it was a amazingly wellone marketing stunt did he say how much he spent on it uh I didn't ask him that so I did talk to him he goes he said we pulled it together in three weeks we had the Pelosi idea we came up with a bunch of research they searched through Tik talk for impersonators went through agents found an actress they hustled their way into you know getting kind of like collabing with the nek boys and Mike during that event because they knew where they like to gamble so they kind of arranged for them to bump into each other and they're like we got a bunch of downloads it's more what he said was he goes it was more expensive than just if we had just run you know Facebook ads but um you know our view is that we're trying to like build the brand and make a statement about what are we all about and that we believe that over time this is going to pay off and if you've seen they've done this actually in a bunch bunch of interesting marketing anything so they did the Pelosi tracker on Twitter which has I don't know hundreds of thousands of followers they have a Instagram account called politicians politician trade tracker which has 730,000 followers and they'll post so like you know like the last post was they had called out weeks ago that Debbie Schultz who is a politician had made a $155,000 trade in her son's name of one random small Mining stock a silver Mining stock and they had flagged it as like hm here's a politician trade that you want to be aware of you know they don't give Financial advice but they just tell you what the politicians are doing and sure enough in a month it's gone up 30% this like random small Mining stock hel mining company so you know called it and and so they they follow these politicians and that's what the whole account is and I think they they tapped into some feeling of like outrage or wrong that people have about what's going on like why why Nancy Pelosi you know outperforms hedge funds and Warren Buffett and her you know her trading track record um they tapped into this feeling that like this is wrong and they should not be allowed and they're using it for their own growth which I think is great dude have you um uh AOC and uh what's Parker or Palmer Lucky's brother-in-law do you know who Palmer luy's brother-in-law is Matt Gates yeah him and AOC have like joined hands for this for like the one thing that they've come together on is the fact that they want uh politicians to not be able to trade or at least have all of their money in like a political ETF or something like that and uh it reminds me of um have you seen that uh video go viral of AOC and Elon Musk flirting yeah so good we gotta play that we should play that right now on YouTube just play that clip it is whoever made this you're an absolute genius I've tried to look up who made this this is like some Anonymous account I watch that video like I've seen it a bunch of times and I rewatch it all the time and it's so funny it's one of the funniest things and they need to they need to do one with AOC and this guy Matt uh of them like fake flirting because this the one thing because I think he's pretty far right she's pretty far left and they've come together on this one like idea that politicians should not be able to trade uh from Individual accounts and I think it's pretty funny yeah that's uh that's pretty wild do you want to do uh one more thing what's this blue collar side hustle all right so I'm bringing it back an old segment we used to have called the Blue Collar side hustle of the month and this is the goal here is these aren't the biggest businesses but they're straightforward businesses that anybody could do if you were just willing to work hard and so the bluecollar side hustle is I saw I forgot who it was Chris corner or somebody like that they were talking about this woman in Dallas who has this awesome porch pumpkins have you seen this the best the best wow you're really into this tell tell me more all right so so the the business idea here is uh every fall for you know sort of Halloween and Thanksgiving people like to decorate their front porch uh with a bunch of pumpkins um and what she does is she will do that as a service so she'll bring to your house a package and you can go to her website and you can see she's it's popped up currently sold out but you can see like three or four packages there's like the luxury package which is $ 1350 so you know $1,300 there's like kind of the medium one $750 and there's a smaller one for like 300 bucks and what she'll do is she'll come and she'll decorate your front front porch the doorstep all that with a bunch of really cool variety of of you know fall you know Harvest type pumpkins and this is all she does and the the numbers that came out was that basically she's done 900 jobs that range you know from this 300 bucks to you know, 1500 bucks and the estimate was that she might have done a million dollars in Revenue in a year off of uh off of those 900 jobs and how cool is this just a you know a mom in Dallas who is going to people's porches and just putting out pumpkins and wow you can kind of hustle your way into a pretty cool business for a very small window of time I think that's the other cool part about this is that um it's only going to take place a few months out of the year and then she posted on Instagram and that kind of drives the flywheel and then people like us talk about this and it gets on the local news and then she's built a kind of a cool business here and we talked about this last year I think one of my blue color side hustles last year was the guy who came and did Christmas lights at my house and he did it for you know half the houses in our neighborhood and I realized like wow in kind of a six to 10 week period you know this guy probably pulled in you know 60 to 100 Grand of side income just by putting up lights him and and he had one one guy working with him and I think this is the extension of that it turns out that it was just Christmas lights you could also do it with fall pumpkins and I'm sure you could do it with Halloween decorations as well if you wanted to expand into that so to me this is an example of a blue collar side hustle now to be clear I don't think she made a million dollars I think she might have generated a million dollars Revenue apparently she's got like 15 delivery guys and like a bunch of other stuff yeah but even if she made $200,000 I would bet it's like you know 100 Grand is my my guess being conservative I would sort of assume that but that's still pretty great for what's probably a you work you know two months out of the year or three months out of the Year straightforward business that you could do that doesn't require you know any special skills and it's pretty fun you know for somebody who's got you know a little bit of design taste I think this is great or or like uh my wife's um not working right now you know she we had a kid and she's uh quit her job and like she's thinking of these things that she can do she's like you know I don't I can't commit to a 40 hour work week or 50 we 52 weeks out the year but I I I would love to have a project you know something that I can do and when I see projects like this I'm like that's awesome that could be perfect do you know what I mean uh and and so she's like looking for projects but you know you can't like you can't commit to a 9o5 or at least you can't commit to a 9o5 for the entire year but you could for little Sprints and so I love ideas like that that can satisfy that need yeah yeah exactly my wife works only on Wednesdays so she works one day out of the week she works kind of like an eight hour day on that day and it's a super creative kind of job I I can't go into all the details but it's very creative so it's fun um it's with somebody she really likes so a cooworker comes over they work together for eight hours a day she's no long then she doesn't have it doesn't spill over so like the next day and the next day after that she doesn't have to like follow through and all the deliverables from the meeting or anything like that and we didn't plan for that but that's we kind of stumbled into what what is basically the perfect amount of work for her because we got three little kids and she wants to be a stay-at home mom but also it's pretty easy to just go nuts you know like to just be it's Groundhog Day when you have three little kids you are doing the same routine every single day and as much as you love your kids like it is nice to have a small break some project you can put your creative energy into a person that's not your family member that you can get to talk to that day and you know not have to deal with the kids for you know eight hours is is a huge win for her dude after this P be like babe what are you what are you do about pumpkins open the trunk like I love the homepage everything it's a trunk full of like 65 pumpkins I love this [ __ ] dude I think this is fantastic and I'm sure that there's like some type of like Artful like aesthetic or you know like you got to have like some type of eye but uh and and it would be silly of me to like be like anyone could do this but it definitely seems learnable this seems very learnable anyone can do this not anyone will do this but but I do think this is not like above you know most people's means to be able to do to be able to pull this soft you know what I would do let's say I wanted to do this how would you how would you approach this you know I would not go into the pumpkin business right away what I would do is I would go door too and I would have basically like three photographs of what the front can look like uh what what packages you have and I would just go to Door go door to door and I would say I'm G to knock on a 100 Doors I'm knock on 100 doors in my neighborhood and I'm basically gonna say hey um just wanted to let you know I do this for families in the area I can make your porch look really great is this something you could be interested in um and then try to see does any is anybody interested basically if people interested that's your pre-order and then you basically go buy the inventory you need to go fulfill just that demand and then as soon as I get some I would take photos of that I would ask them can I uh you know would you mind if I use this for my website for my marketing they would say yes and if they say yes then I would go to I would now have better marketing material that I would go to the next door with and I would say um you know we did this there and I would try to have something if I could maybe one branded pumpkin that's kind of like this was done by the you know the local pumpkin queen or whatever it is right and like have my my my domain on one of them if I if I could to try to get people to be able to go find me from there and then go and upcharge them when they [ __ ] start to rot and you got to get rid of them well there is a there is a pickup or like a cleanup fee right that you do at the end uh same thing with the Christmas lights guy he's like yeah then you pay me you pay me to put them up and you pay me to put them take them down and so you get both sides of it I also think that this is one where you could if you ever go read like these PR books that were like local PR newsjacking so like local news is pretty much devoid of good stories and so you can see this if you ever turn on like your local news channel there this restaurant you know got flagged for this thing they're looking for you know good local feel-good stories and so as soon as you get a little bit going and then you could say whatever single mom who's making thousands of dollars decorating their you know their neighbors porches and so as soon as I get just enough momentum my goal would be to get to the new local news and I would go there i' make my pitch for the story and I would try to get it you know try to get my story on air for that local news and then what I would do is I would take that that news story right you're stacking the marketing chips and then you could even run ads on that local news story that article uh in your area dude I grew up um like with a big steep driveway and then at there was a small Street and then there was like a park and it was it was as if I was like the park was like a canyon and one month after Halloween it was a tradition at my house and my parents this was one of the more redneck things that my father has ever done which was we would take all 20 of our pumpkins and we would let them roll down our Hill the running of the bulls straight to the middle of the park and I up until like uh I was like 25 I thought it was okay to just if you have like a banana peel or something like you just like [ __ ] toss it in the street like it doesn't matter like we used to put our pumpkins like in the street like it it doesn't matter right that's not littering turns out that is littering by the way like you can't like there's like for all of like November or whatever there' be like the 20 rotting pumpkins in the middle of this in the middle of this park and like if you're gonna go play flag football that month like look out for the rotting pumpkins at the pars through in the middle of that [ __ ] Park yeah you needed the opposite of the news story it's like local family terrorizes park Runing pumpkins again dude I thought it was like acceptable like it's like oh just put it back to its home I'm just throwing this throwing this [ __ ] banana peel and all our garbage right in the middle of a park um where do we want to go from here uh I think we wrap this one so we got the do nothing man the loneliness epidemic we have uh the autopilot marketing stunt and then we got the blue collar side hustle that anybody could do door too all right let's do it that's it that's the pod [Music]

all right we're live with Steph Smith Steph Smith this is your eighth time on the podcast is that right I know it's wild yes you sent me a document in advance and it had a bunch of stuff but there was one topic that caught my eye it's called the silver tsunami which basically just means that we are living way longer than expected if it's cool with you I kind of just want to talk about that topic this entire time because like there was so many stats here that kind of shocked me [Music] give me the background tell tell The Liston in the background what's the silver tsunami and what's like the one sentence summary of this entire topic I mean the the simplest summary is just we're expected to live way way later and I think there's this kind of misconception that we've hit some sort of basically plateau in aging right so in the last I think several decades the staff is for every decade we've added two to three years to the average lifespan which means that you know we are expected to grow older compared to our parents compared to their parents etc etc right so you can just go to I mean the simplest way to look at it is if you just go to our W in data life expectancy you can see around 1900 something fundamentally changes and we're just growing way way older that has to do with child mortality but also just again extending that maybe like 50-year period and so so what that means is that you know you have this cohort of people you called it the silver tsunami who are just going to be around for a lot longer than maybe people expected and that impacts tons of things that impacts you know the pensions that people were expecting it impacts the kind of nursing homes you need it impacts the kind of Health Care people think about you know in that later age um it impacts like a lot of young people who then you know at least in theory have to support those old people and so this whole um silver tsunami is a little bit overlooked so all right so I want to go through the story so the story of what has changed and the story of what to expect in the next uh well I guess if you're listening to this you're probably at least 18 years old all the way up to 80 years old so for but let's just say the average let's just say the average is 25 to 35 years old if you're in that demographic what to expect and then after that will'll go through the different business opportunities or potential issues and other things like that that might exists if all this comes to fruition yeah so maybe let's start with a really simple stat um I got this from a book called Longevity imperative that I read recently um and he's from the UK so he uses UK data here but he says in in the UK in 1965 the most common age of death was the first year um that's perhaps not surprising but today the most common age to die is 87 so that's a really simple just encapsulation of how things have completely flipped on on their side but then let's move on to maybe cohort data so I'd like you to guess the chance of a newborn girl in Japan as of 2020 data what is their chance of living till 20 close to 100% 98 so 99.6% chance now guess the same for living to 40 to 40 uh 95 90% 99 and the chance of making it to 60 98 no no no that's too high 95 again 96% so if you think about it a woman in Japan uh born in 20120 or as of 2020 data has a 96% chance of making it to 60 that's like pretty close to 100% obviously that's not 100% but the point is your Calculus changes when you when you fundamentally expect to live to 60 so what whenever I think about my life it's kind of messed up so I actually think that like I'm only going to live to be 75 which means at the age of 35 I'm nearly halfway through my life but then when I like calculate so I do this weird thing with my net worth where I added in these calculators and I'm like all right at this if I have what I have now and it grows at 8% a year that means at the age of 40 I'll have this at the age of 50 I'll have this and I'll drag it out to like 110 and I'm like holy crap at at age of 110 I'm going to have this and like the numberers just like massive right and so in some ways I assume I'm going to live to be like 110 in other ways I assume I'm going to live to be 75 which is actually totally uh that range is problematic what ages do people like you and me so we we do a lot of stuff that is good for our health and we have resources what are we going to live to then well I think yeah the even just like the average uh lifespan in America is long longer than 75 but I mean in theory it's going to be a range but that's part of the complexity here where so Sam you're also thinking about this from the perspective of like you've sold a company you have a nest egg and so you can imagine how that Nest Egg grows over time but you imagine the flip side for like the average American who expects to retire at 65 well if you're only expecting to live to 75 then you can probably save up for 10 years of life but as soon as you're living to 85 maybe even 95 like then you are in theory having to save up for 30 years of life um and the way that again like our economics real estate all of that isn't really set up for people living substantially longer and by the way the last thing I'll say there is one thing that I was surprised by in the book is one so this isn't surprising America is falling behind some of the other like G7 Nations around longevity but I thought it was because generally people were dying earlier um but it's actually due to these things called diseases of Despair so just like alcoholism um drugs Etc but if you remove those Americans are living just as long as you know the comparable Nations and so what are some other crazy stats around this because you had some like ridiculous stuff so like for example you said something like um America was spending some absurd number for uh NASA in getting to the Moon which is awesome I'm in favor of that and then you compared it to how much they were spending for uh longevity or expanding life and it was like a fraction of the amount is that is that true well so I think there's a couple different stats there so America I think like healthcare is like 20% of GDP which is huge um but I think the stat specifically that you were looking at was shared on Twitter um and it was basically that 8% of the US budget is spent on kidney dialysis which was basically three times NASA so all these people need dialysis it's like I think Medicare spends over $50 billion annually on dialysis and other related treatments which is just wild um and it's I think an example of how you know like when Health goes Ary and all these people are living to old age the budget that's required for it is just blowing up and so what are the opportunities here let's start with one that maybe the MFM listener base won't be super stoked on maybe the four female listeners but one really interesting one is menopause so menopause is when women's ovaries stop working so it obviously impacts anyone with ovaries um once you get to a certain point and here's an interesting stat um again from that book below the age of 55 cardiovascular illness um is a more likely cause of mortality in men and then after 55 again around that menopause stage it basically reverses because what menopause is is like I'm obviously oversimplifying it's just like an a super super accelerated aging period for women what age is that typically happened 50 yeah around like 50 or 60 like in that that range I think sometimes even earlier sometimes in 40s but I haven't hit it yet so um not haven't experienced it firsthand but what happens because it's like kind of a fundamentally your hormones are changing one of your most significant organs is just no longer producing eggs your body ends up having all these symptoms people often refer to th 34 symptoms of menopause and just due to the nature of like you could say Tam 6,000 women in the US hit menopause every single day so if you think about people who all of a sudden are facing this thing that they've never faced before kind of like pregnancy and interestingly there's all these companies that are oriented around people getting pregnant and having that done successfully there's apps like Flo there's um dude Flo is a massive business isn't it yeah I mean at least even publicly on their site they say over 380 million people use it and what's flow do so flow is a period tracking app or at least that's how they started but also I think they've expanded and um like even when you track your period I use it right it'll give you suggestions on like are you bloated or like you should you be eating this this or this um it's actually pretty simplistic but 380 million people use it because it's just like again the dam is so big of people who care about this thing all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think and so where are the different opportunities you think in with that I mean there are some companies that have uh sprung up already one of them is called Bonafide or bonafed another called genev but basically like all of the symptoms the 34 of them that women start to face like hot flashes but that's just an example of where I think even just fundamentally it's there are less female entrepreneurs there are less entrepreneurs over the age of 50 right who are starting companies and so I think it's a completely overlooked space because once people hit this age they're not really trying to start a company and then all the other people aren't really aware of how significant this transformation is for all of these women for literally billions of women around the around the world and so I feel like it's just totally overlooked there they're uh you know we use this phrase one chart businesses because you just see this chart and it like you said well there that thing's obvious just get into that industry you have one here you said in the uh in United States um the uh the US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that nursing will be the fastest growing occupation between 2020 and 2030 growing in number by 275,000 uh jobs that's insane that's insane talk to me about this nursing thing yeah well I mean again it's like a pretty clear Trend that comes with a bunch of people getting getting older like everyone's talking about Ai and that's great um but what about the billions of people around the globe that are you know 65 plus that are just going to need physical human support so nursing's one area also the the rest of that stat talks about in Japan the number of nursing homes has risen nearly 50% over the last decade and Japan is interesting because it's kind of like this early case study um where they've hit this silver tsunami a little earlier than uh a lot of other countries why has Japan hit this first like all these stats are like Japanese stuff is always reference when it comes to getting old why Japan I think they just hit the declining birth rate earlier than many other countries and so you know another interesting you could say it opportunity maybe just an interesting thing for individuals to explore but because Japan hit the like silver tsunami a little earlier they have this interesting thing where they're giving away free houses or super cheap houses sometimes free um they're called aias a k i y a um I was in Japan this summer and we did a walking tour and they took us around and they were showing us these houses and they're like see this house and it was like in the middle of Osaka it was a little run down for sure um but they were like this this house is free and we were like what do you what do you mean but because there's so many of these people who have grown old unfortunately passed away and then there also some social aspects of the aias where in some cases not all um because Japanese people really care about status if let's say they grew up in a poor neighborhood their parents passed away and then they've moved into you know a different social strata um they don't want to claim the house because they're like I don't want to be associated with that neighborhood and there's over there's tons of articles on this over 8 million aias that are being given away by the government um or again sometimes for very cheap so well have you heard the uh the theory about Osaka and how a lot of people are lying about their R oh yeah the blue zones and to yeah there's a book called The Blue zones and basically like I read it 10 years ago or something and I was like this is my Bible for like living a long healthy life turns out uh now this is a I believe a hypothesis I don't know like what the it's I'm kind of regurgitating like a headline a little bit so I would have to like actually research it to to definitive say but the idea is that someone studied Osaka's population and they found that too many people claim to have the same birth date in Osaka yeah to the point where the only way that this could be possibly true is if many of them committed fraud in order to say that they are of a certain age so they can start receiving Social Security and other like benefits that you get when you hit a certain age and so it potentially puts a lot of like this idea of we study this particular population for old health or you know old people and like looking at like wow they're so healthy when they're just liars and they're actually a lot younger they're a lot younger potentially than they've said they are what are some other stats about those I love I love talking to you because you just have like you actually have the data and the stats instead of just like guessing um okay so we didn't really drill down as much on the I mean you talked about nursing homes and assisted living so let me give you one more from um numlock which by the way is a great newsletter Walt hickey runs it and um people I feel like MFM listeners would love it it's great because you talk about these one chart businesses I've done a thread on something similar and I call them digits but he calls them just numbers right so basically every single day actually he sends a newsletter of maybe five or so different just small paragraphs and each paragraph has just like one statistic and I like his because some of them are really important like you know this silver tsunami and how that's going to impact things much greater than ourselves but then sometimes it's like there's this random deral that it has infested homes in South Carolina or something like that this is awesome yeah um he sent this paragraph about Assisted Living so let me just read this out this is directly from numlock from 2004 to 2021 the median annual price of Assisted Living increased 31% faster than inflation and has hit $54,000 per year this is the crazy stat to me there are 31,000 assisted living facilities in the United States four out of every five are run as for-profits and half of all the operators in the industry are clearing annual returns of 20% or more than it costs to operate with 850,000 older Americans living within assisted living the rents are getting jacked up so I don't actually know how Assisted Living businesses are valued like is it considered like a real estate valuation where it's just like a a way to finance or pay for Real Estate or is it considered like a proper operating business like I guess you know how like hotels are classified as real estate you know what I mean so I I would assume that's that's the case of which 20% is is fantastic if 20% were operating profit on a on a proper like uh like internet business that's not that great but if it's on real estate that's really great however when I read this I think yeah that's lucrative I don't want to no I don't either I don't sound like the worst thing ever you'd have a funeral a day you know what I mean well I think people are in this for quite some time so you could say again purely from the business perspective that you have this recurring revenue for years you know before obviously some eventual very unfortunate form I would love to invest in a nursing home fund but I would not want to operate a nursing home well what I'll say is I mean my I have parents that are getting older and there's also tons of assisted living for not just elderly right people with mental illness or who need other support um mental or physical and I think what I've seen from like exploring this space anecdotally is that most of the options really suck as in like you you don't really feel great about sending your parent or loved one to these places and so I I haven't explored this deeply enough this might exist so if if folks are listening and and they know of this I would love to hear about it but like imagine the the premium version of Assisted Living where you feel really really good about sending your grandparent your mom your sister whatever it is to one of these places and obviously the the you know the price would have to go way up um but people are already like this stat is saying they're spending $54,000 per year as the average um and so you know for the wealthy like wouldn't you pay five times that to send your loved one to something a lot better yeah and I think people do like I I know people who have people in nursing homes and they spend 20 or $30,000 a month it's insane it it's absolutely insane why haven't there been any uh new startups in the space like for example um what I got sick uh a few years ago and I had a IV in my arm for I think 35 days and I used to have a nurse have to come to my house every three or four days to to change out the IV and typically these nurses that did this they I was an I wasn't normal it's mostly older people who they work with and finding these nurses was a nightmare like finding them via my healthcare provider nightmare shockingly a large percentage of the people and this was when I was in New York uh I got sick over summertime and I had I get this and shockingly a large percentage of these businesses were mom and pop businesses and so it was actually quite hard to operate like they didn't have like a web portal that I could interact with I had to like call them all the time to schedule them why hasn't there been interesting Technology based startups in this space I mean I'm sure there are some that exist but I I'll kind of revert back to what I said about even menopause like this is not a sexy space right the the problems that people face at this point in their life um most entrepreneurs have not experienced right so like they are not thinking about what an 80-year-old might need because they've never been 80 right and and so I think it's a little different where if I'm you know in gen Z I'm very I'm not but if I were I'd be very much uh I'd be more likely to want to create a business for people that I understand and so for that reason I think this this these industries haven't really been tackled as much but here's an example of where I think you could merge Knowledge from a younger base with you know the assisted living facilities I don't know if this would work um but there's this idea I also read outlive by Peter AA and he talks about this Centenary into cathlon right um and he talks about how he works with people and he tries to get them to basically the fitness level of people two decades younger and actually what he tries to do is to get them at the fitness level at the elite top 2% of people two decades younger and he talks about in his book how you know when people first hear that he's like you know most people think it's impossible right like I can't even get in the top 2% of my age let alone two decades younger but he gives all these examples and the one that all site is have you heard of Robert Marshon no what's that so he's unfortunately passed away he passed away at 109 but he at um 101 was still cycling and he he broke some records at 101 and he decided that wasn't enough so he then worked with a bunch of trainers and tried to break his existing record at 103 he hit 27 kilometers an hour on a bike um and he continued competing until he was 105 if you look him up on YouTube there's all these videos of him like getting past the finish line and there's all these reporters like coming in trying to film him because he's just like he shouldn't be doing the things that he's doing at 101 three or five and so he gives several examples as in Peter does in his book of these people who at 80 90 even over a hundred like Robert who have kind of not just um competed throughout their life but in some cases like didn't take care of themselves and then got on this regimen and completely like shaped reshaped their Fitness and so you could imagine what if you could send your loved one or they opt into this hopefully to a place where it's not just this idea of Assisted Living where you kind of go there to die what if you go there for like a Revival um what if you go there with a V2 Max of 15 and all of a sudden you leave with it at 25 and you're 80 like that is really cool um and it kind of merges some of the trends that we're seeing in like the kind of more new age Fitness and Longevity with this massive business around Assisted Living so when I lived in Austin I would say uh Austin is probably the most fit place I've ever been in if you like go along the trail on like ladyb Lake like everyone is jacked and like muscular and like women there tend to like lifting weights more than I've ever seen in different like cities like it's pretty wild like everyone's into it uh and so amongst my friends like being healthy is part is definitely a lifestyle that we're all bought into when you're doing this research is there something where it's just like so like in order to do what you're saying you you need I think there needs to be like a it needs to be part of like the fabric of society whereas right now it's not so for example I love watching prison TV shows it's a confession I'm s power I like watching pris TV shows and one of my favorite things to watch are in different European countries as well as in China and parts a few other countries in Asia they make the inmates do exercise hour where like you have to like get out of the cell and you must do a routine and the idea is like if you care about your body and exercise you're going to start caring about other things and hopefully you'll be a better person another example is I've got this friend named an an started this company called soree which is like um a Pilates business that she sold for hundreds millions of dollars her first company was a nonprofit that taught homeless men how to run and the reason she taught homeless men how to run is because if you learn how to get up at 5:00 a.m. and care about Fitness you're likely to care about other things and thus hopefully get clean and sober and get a stable job whatever and so anyway I'm on board with what you're saying but I don't think any of this will actually happen at least in America not for a while and a lot of people listening to this podcast are coastal people they're basically like Coastal Elites you know they they live in New York they live in San Francisco like you or me they live in LA where they're used to like seeing the fit stuff but if you go to Missouri where I'm from or you go to other parts in the midwest this whole Fitness stuff ain't exactly a thing like for example I had a family member who got diabetes and when the when he saw the doctor like he was like uh like I got really sick and hospitalized and like the doctor's like yeah you have diabetes and the person was like well what do I do and the doctor was like ah just like uh just eat healthy like you know what me it was just like like like just it was like I don't know man like figured out like and the doctor was fat so anyway my my point being is like is this realistic that any of this can actually happen or that any of this or or that like if you started some of these businesses that people would actually take to it yeah so I think this is actually uh an opportunity in the sense that if you think about yeah like you said we're Coastal Elites um we're also highly competitive like I think the people who listen to this podcast are the same so what do we gravit itate towards 75 hard you gravitate towards like hitting new PBS on straa um you go to doctors like Peter AA who only sees like you know a few dozen patients a year and it's a quarter of a million dollars exactly exactly so I agree um but I actually tweeted this the other day I was like how much better would a lot of people's lives be if they just moved for three miles a day I know that sounds like a lot to some people you could even break it bring it down to one or two um but like we don't need 75 hard and nothing against it but like we need someone someone commented we need 30 moderate because if you actually it takes a little bit of time for people if they're really out of shape to get here but if you get into even moderate shape you can run three miles in 30 minutes right and if you think about that's half the length of a yoga class right like it doesn't take that much of your day you don't need the hour plus morning routine you just need something really really moderate right um and that's obviously like you said it's um what do James Clear talk about like Keystone habits you do that and everything else unlocks and so I think there there's some sort of very very average and I mean average in a good way program that should be out there that is not 75 hard like that is something way way more approachable um that the average American can do and maybe it's not even three miles at this point maybe it's one and then the second year you go to two and then the third year you go to three um but I say that because like I used to hate running and there's all these you said something do you do you even exercise I'm I'm probably going to hit around 500 Miles this year um in running and then soccer spin Etc but it took me here's here's the real takeaway for like the average person who hates running it took me probably a year and a half to like running um which was way longer than I thought right people talk about the runner's high and like if you just do it enough like it'll it'll kick in took me a year and a half of pretty consistent running for some switch to flip where all of a sudden was enjoyable tell me some let's keep keep just rattling off some of these interesting stats and it's okay if it's not related to longevity well let's talk about one thing real quick on the longevity side and I think one of the reasons that I got into running was because I started using Strava and I had data so another example of people getting data um you used a CGM before right a continu yeah I'm an investor of levels so I used one of those for a long time I've also done um a lot of um Tere length I think it's tell them me your anyway like measuring those cells I do a lot of blood work I do a ton of I do a ton of blood work actually probably quarterly um I track my weight every day for the last four years I think or three years I've tracked almost everything I've eaten on my body or uh I use my body tutor which is like nutritional service but I track all of my food on my fitness pal but yeah I track a lot of stuff you do a lot more than the average human um but C jams in particular by the way what I just said sounds like a lot it adds up to roughly 10 minutes a week wow like it's not that hard well let me just quickly share this one thing on the cgms which is Dexcom which is one of the companies that manufactures them I think they have like 40% market share or something in that range their new product Stell is the first over-the-counter FDA approved CGM this was just as of like last month um end of August and to me this is really interesting because I think before I can't I don't know exactly how you got one I think you needed a prescription but you could get that if you're overweight or you had diabetes most people didn't seek it out um I've been testing one for the last two weeks and I love it like I I'm obviously not affiliated at all um and by the way uh CGM that stands for continuous glucose monitor which basically you put this little like quarter size got mine a little dirty from my sweater but yeah you like you basically inject that into your arm and it measures your blood glucose levels uh and so you can just like put your app to it at any given point right and it will tell you what your blood glucose monitor is or your blood glucose level sry yeah exactly so each one lasts around two weeks I think a lot of people just do it for two to four weeks and they get a lot of data around you know like what's your resting or fasting uh glucose level and it basically does the same same thing that uh dexa does which is a lot of people will say oh I'm 15% body fat and they go do a dexa and they're really like 22 it's like a very like harsh thing dexas are very harsh and uh cgms are very harsh too you'll think uh oh I'm going to eat healthy I'm going to eat a salad and then you eat just a little bit of cranberries in your salad or a little bit of like dressing uh like some type of sugary dressing in your salad and your blood glucose spikes or you're like I'm just going to eat steak and a potato or like something that you view as like a whole food and your blood glucose monitor like starts going off like an alarm because it's shocking how some of this stuff Peaks your your blood yeah I the reason I love it is because of what you're saying so we are a family at home with an eight sleep I've got an Apple Watch my husband's bought like four aura rings like we are similar to you and that he put all his or ring just like get a new version he's like I need the new version It's I I don't know um but point is like we we've used a lot of this technology and my problem with some of it is that it is so broad that you're like okay I slept bad last night how do I fix it and I think the the most major thing people talk about is alcohol but you know on a more granular level like what changes should I make um this like you said it's so reactive where you can see exactly what spikes you and sometimes it's not very um reassuring where you're like okay like you know I can't hide basically is the idea and so I've I've really been enjoying it and I think the fact that it now is over the counter I think there's what levels is the company already kind of doing this but by the way I uh I did invest in levels so I I will promote it uh level.com I think you can you can go to their website right now and you can get one of these things that that's that is my plug and I'm letting people know so we we both have a stake here just let everyone know but go ahead well I was going to say so Dexcom the company that uh that sells these stellos and they have a few other more expensive cgms um they have an API I don't think it's fully open but I think you know you can apply to use it and very simple idea I hate to even use this like comparable but I think there should be a Strava for cgms now that more people are using it even during just that trial period of a month of learning like I think um being able to kind of socialize what you're learning but also compete in a way um that's what straa is like you're congratulating each other but you're also seeing other people's PBS seeing in the equivalent version with the CGM you see like are you spending your day in range like how big are your spikes what's your Dawn effect which is when it's basically your Rising glucose after you wake up I think that there's going to be some sort of socialization of this I don't know exactly what it looks like and maybe just one example of where you can already see this before Stell existed is have you heard of the glucose goddess no what is this it's this just this woman she's got 5 million followers on Instagram 1 million on YouTube um she got she has a recipe Club where she charges $5 a month and she recently released I think it was just as of the last few months a product called anti- Spike um dude her website is awesome I love this woman is that her in the main photo she looks like a 1970s this woman is haircut yeah I know she's like cool to look at this lady is cool all right so go ahead who is this lady she calls of the glucose goddess and she basically is an educator on on glucose and I think or as in specifically like your how your body reacts and is this a big business well so again she's got um so she just released anti Spike which was her first product I have no idea if it's good or not I think she said it's it's four ingredients it's like cinnamon malberry leaves and two other things and um that website which is separate from her maid one is already doing over 100,000 views a month um so I don't know what her sales are but she's definitely getting traffic there and I think you know that's just like one example where people are like really engaged in this Channel's what's the point of this why is keeping my blood glucose from spiking good for me when your blood glucose is high it's basically doing damage to your organs I think like basically the granules impact your artery walls they they also like if you over time have too much blood glucose when your body is um secreting insulin to bring it down your insulin resistance goes up and basically like I think a lot of people are aware of type two diabetes like that is one um way that your body breaks down with high glucose but again like just having a an elevated glucose level over time just impacts like your cell specifically and and how they operate so there's a few things that you want to pay attention to it's like how high the spike is but also I think the more important part is the area under the curve of your Spike um so how long does it take for it to bring uh for you to bring your glucose down but the point is that like I've started to do this for two weeks and similar to you it's like an endless stream of questions around like how high is too high and like what does it mean if I have like a double hump and what does it mean if my glucose is higher the next day and so I think there's like a community aspect um and I also think like if we think about the marketing side of this I think there's probably some genius business where you actually use something like a Stell as a loss leader so it's around 50 bucks for one for two weeks um and you could imagine a business where you you'd have to M like get this really right but um you give them the Stell for free um you make sure like they have to use it for two weeks and jot down what they're eating and their lifestyle and at the end of that two weeks think of all of the information you have about that person's metabolic Health the way they eat the way they exercise um and there are so many different businesses that I mean you mentioned some of them like you have the health concierge that they sign up for after that you have someone who educates them on you know their nutrition and their exercise maybe they get a personal trainer um maybe you have some sort of referral with specific gyms in their area um maybe you have a deal with Dexcom directly for their next CGM because they're probably want going to want to keep going um I think there's there's something genius in that you know loss leader idea given the price point of it being around 50 bucks for two weeks you know what one of my friends did and I think you know I'm justtin mayor so he did it during Co I believe it was called wearable challenge.com and the way it worked was I venmoed him $900 M and EV and I would have to send him proof uh so basically I sent up $900 the goal of the challenge was to keep my blood glucose level below I forget the metric would something like5 makes sense um that roughly makes sense the range is like 80 to 140 healthy but a lot of like Health Geeks are like that's way too broad and they say like 120 so whatever the threshold is like 115 or 120 I forget like I anyway uh it was like 120 whatever and I had to send him proof that day that I did not go above 120 and every day that I sent him proof I got $30 back and so by the end of the challenge if I would had a 100% success rate I got my whole $900 back if I uh did it well or if I screwed up which I actually screwed up like four times I think uh it was like four times on accident where I was like uh like this particular fruit I'm able to have a little bit of that it is and and I like it was like or another time it was like a raspberry flavor dressing or something like that that totally made me Spike and it was pretty brilliant and I think Justin said that it was fairly successful I don't know why he shut it down and so anyway that was like a cool business built on the back of that um one last thing I wanted to ask you about what's this what is was all this posture stuff that you had uh and and by the way I think it's crazy that you're like all all of a sudden into all this health stuff because that's not the stuff that I knew because when I first started working with you you were naturally a very thin person and I think when you're natur thin you don't really give a about health because you're like I'm skinny therefore I'm healthy and so now I think it's cool that you're into all this stuff well that's exactly right I think there's this like misconception that if you're skinny you're healthy and as I've gone down this Rabbit Hole I was like oh I'm I was not healthy and um I think actually one of the things that triggered me was two years ago um I did qbio so you guys have talked about that before it's like one of the full uh body Health scans and my cholesterol was high and I was like why is my cholesterol High high and at first I was like oh it must be um genetics right like I must have a history of this and then I found out neither of my parents have high cholesterol and my dad is like not very healthy at all and I was like how do I have higher cholesterol than my father um and so it was like this I think that was uh the impetus but I think generally that's why I encourage people like I mean do your own research not affiliate or whatever but like doing something like a CGM like you said is like you just cannot hide um getting your blood work you can not hide you you get the data and no matter how skinny you are you you you see the results and by the way like I wasn't surprised in a way because I wasn't exercising properly like I wasn't eating as well as I could but on the posture side um it's just another one of these like spin-offs of of Health but I spend way too much time online I think a lot of people do too so I've got a bad case hopefully improving case of nerdneck some people call It Forward uh head posture um but basically it's just because we're we're punched over at a computer all day long um and I haven't done a ton here like I'm kind of on the like very early part of this curve but I have played around with I'm not using it right now hold up there's this thing I don't know if I'd vouch for it or not yet but this thing called better back I'm looking at it I think any anytime that you have to use one of these devices I tend to get nervous that it's legit but go ahead what is it well that's why I don't know so it has helped me sit up more basically like like it runs around your knees and your back and I like it better than some there's things you you can put on your back that like zap you and stuff and I feel like that's really unnatural but this actually just because it's like fixated around your knees you just sit up straighter um the whole time you're sitting so there's things like that so for for those listening it's basically like a strap that when you're sitting down it wraps around your back and then attaches to your knees and in doing that it kind of forces you to sit up yeah there's other um for the women the you're four female listeners there's a sports bra that I haven't tried yet called form which apparently like folks like Taylor Swift have used if you look at her posture a decade ago was way way worse so there like there's a small part of me that believes that something like that works can I use this you can like you're telling me just like this like shirt that I mean for me it would be a shirt that's going to make me have better posture what is this thing I haven't tried it but um it's it's a sports bra that people vouch helps your posture but I think generally as I've explored this a little bit it is a function of your muscle right like if you have strength in your abdomen and your back like you're going to sit up straighter but there's a video I shared we can include all this in the show notes um this is actually just like an email I sent or I'm going to send to the internet pipes crew this month but like it's um a video from Brian Johnson around his posture he worked with a posture coach for several months and then Tim Ferris has recommended something called the egos skew method which I have not tried um and what's this Brian Johnson video what how do I just make my posture better there's three different exercises that he does every single day and he shares them in this video um that improved his posture and what's this ego ego ESU it's a method that I think you need to like work with a practitioner for which is why again I'm not um I don't I don't think I'm vouching for this in any way but it's just something that came up dude there's this great uh it's t talk that you should watch it why sitting down destroys you I think it's by Roger uh Frampton I believe that's the one uh but it's a a TED Talk that has millions of views and he basically goes through this idea of how he worked I I think he worked in in the Amazon he worked with some like indigenous tribe where they didn't have a they didn't use like a lot of chairs or something like that and what he found was that basically the people who in in today's age we don't really do this but we used to where if you stand a lot you squeeze your ass like imagine you got a you got a little penny in your butt cheeks that you're trying to keep from falling down on the ground that's basically what you do you like squeeze your butt together when you're standing and there's a reason why our glutes typically tend to be our largest muscle it's because we were supposed to use them a lot and how we don't really use them too much any anymore and so instead when we stand we kind of uh lean forward and he was like no you should actually when you stand he was like a lot of babies actually if you watch like a kid you'll notice they they they do a good job of this but you squeeze your butt together and and and and you flex your abs as opposed to just falling forward and if you work on it you can actually hold that for like a fairly long time when you're standing and that's the proper way to stand and so it's not just sitting that will destroy you but standing uh incorrectly you know what I mean yeah totally well even in the video I did watch with Brian Johnson he was talking about how most people when they think they want good posture they like tilt their head back and that's bad as well like they're kind of like oh I have good posture like this um and you really want to be more like head your the back of your neck should be absolutely straight so um yeah dude Steph um are there are there any more of these stats or storylines that we should dive into let's do uh this idea of barbell Sports just because we're doing this whole like Fitness longevity stuff so all I want to do is share kind of a frame with folks which is like you know you've had a bunch of the you know you call tier one sports that everyone knows soccer basketball baseball that have existed for a long time um they're in every school but now you're seeing all of these more Niche Sports pop up pickle ball is the most famous example but there's also sports like Tech ball have you heard of tech ball what is Tech ball teq ball um so it's I don't know how to explain it um the best version I think is like it's a mix of soccer and pingpong so imagine like a big ping pong table and then you're using your body and it's like a large ball to basically lob you know the ball over the net there's crazy videos on YouTube of this this Tech ball I think Tech ball itself has four million followers on Facebook some of their videos on YouTube have millions of views because it really is just like freak of nature kind of stuff people are doing almost like flips to like uh to get the ball but the reason I mention it is because again this Frame is what did pickle ball do pickle ball basically took tennis or something like it and it made it more accessible right they changed um how bouncy the ball was they changed the size of the Court they changed the way that the paddle feels so that just about anyone could play right tennis is like pretty pretty hard to do well and there's a version of of people who want to do it but pickle ball basically open the aperture so more people could participate so I think like if you take an existing Sport and you make it more make it less agile so more people can participate that's One Direction and then Tech ball is the opposite the same way that in like fashion you have fast fashion and then you have the premium Brands and basically nothing in the middle succeeds I think it's like an interesting parallel where Tech ball is like you actually make it way harder right so that some people who just want to like prove that they're extremely agile and that they're competitors and their winners um gravitate to sports something like that because they just want to be the best and that's a much more Again sharable Sport because you're clipping this thing up and you're basically showing like look at this freak of nature what's padell all my friends keep talking about this thing called padel and I'm like is it paddle or padel I always thought it was padel before hearing people play here's what reminds me of one time I went to a conference in Europe and there was this like white Michigan lady who was like had been living in Germany or something like that for like two years and she was this influencer and she was talking about how she had this brand deal with Adidas and she's talking to me I'm like dude we're from we're both from the Midwest and I'm like what the hell is Adias she's like Adidas you don't know Adidas the the the shoe brand and I'm like do you mean Adidas and she's like no I mean Adidas that's called Adidas and I was like dude you just call it Adidas you know I don't know what that means and I always thought that padell it was someone like this fancy guy talking to me about padell I'm like are you trying to say the word paddle is that really what you mean what the hell does padel mean and I think it's actually called padel that's my long story I don't know what it's called like all the best players are in Spain and um I think I I don't know I I don't know if this is one of those cases where like you know how countries will have their own name and then other countries will be just be like actually we're not going to call you sparia which is what you call yourself we're just G to call you Sweden and just like imagine if I did that to you Sam I'm like I know you think you're Sam but like I'm just gonna call you Scott yeah I feel that it's weird so I don't know what I don't know if padell is correct um or it's just the Americanized version of paddle but um that is I played it while I was in New York it's like also kind of like 10 but there's a wall behind you and the wall is in play and it's blowing up it's totally blowing up I think that's another example of the latter example where you take something and you actually make it harder so that's just the frame and like maybe one other example of where you make something again you're attracting these like go hard people is everesting um have you heard of everesting yeah uh so one of the guys who started this company Mark is in Hampton and I've gotten to know him go ahead what's it called or explain what it is it's basically just um for the people who want to climb Everest but can't make it to Everest um it's just this competition where people like run up and down any Hill as many times as possible that equates to what it would be to climb Everest this is an interesting frame because it's it's actually what can you do with no equipment right like running you can do that with right and what can you do anywhere but running is boring for a lot of people just like pure Pure Play running so this is an example where you can do it anywhere you've got a hill I am going to do one of those this year the the it's called 29029 I'm doing one this year do you want to do it with me uh when is it uh he's sending me the list of uh he's letting me pick one and ATT 10 one for free uh which is like a big deal I think it's like five grand um but they um talk about a business it's expensive it's really expensive because they give you like a glamping tent setup like it's a kind of like a high-end camping thing I I could get the price wrong I think it's I think it's thousands of dollars I thought it was 5,000 uh but I could get I could have gotten it wrong but uh he's sending me the the the schedule and they have them in like Maine and Utah and all these places uh it looks pretty awesome I mean I'm down I don't think I I honestly don't think I'll be able to complete it so he told me when he was creating it you said that the rules are to make or you said that with a lot of these Sports you want it to be hard he said he said you wanted he's like we made it hard enough that only 25% of the participants will be able to finish Okay and like and it just sounds really hard yeah maybe I'm not down um I feel like I really care so even in setting my goal for the half marathon I'm like one of those people where I'm like I probably should set a more ambitious goal but like I really want to hit my goal I'm gonna feel really bad it's not even that that's what I mean it's it's 9 minute mile for for the half I think that's good I don't know who cares though really I mean I'm 53 so 53 female so what does have to do with anything well I mean it's I think it's just like you know it's my first half I'm like you're better if you're shorter by the way are you is that true yeah yeah so a lot of people I so I looked into this uh because I was always curious I believe stride length and height are not necessarily correlated oh so the length of your legs is not entirely no you'll have to look this up to verify that I'm right but the length of your legs is not necessarily correlated with the strength or the the length of your stride it's how much force you're exerting against the ground um and so you can have similar height or different height people have very similar stride length depending on how much force they put against the ground does that make sense it does but I had no idea I was using look at me I was this whole time I was like I'm no you're using that as a excuse yeah I know no and and in fact if you look at some of the fastest Mar thunders in the world so if you or even like uh the 5K 10K uh a lot of them particular you know these Ethiopian women are quite short and I would argue I I bet you if you looked up who won the 5K 10K Marathon this year in the Olympics I bet you the top 10 finishers of each on average was 53 uh height so that's a excuse okay I'm guting that excuse well even if it's not true but here's here's another thing that I was gonna ask you when we were talking about living forever I think a lot of people who live to be old I think they're smaller so if you look like there aren't a lot of old Giants um and so what always freaks me out is I'm 6'2 205 pounds or so so I think I'm maybe the 90th percentile of height uh I get nervous that there aren't a lot of examples of tall people who live a long time yeah but I think like so probably the references you're thinking of are people who are like 100 plus I think it's probably pretty common for people to live into their 90s um yeah but I I'm trying to be I'm trying to get to that 120 130 range come on uh what's the oldest of like oldest human who's lived probably 120 something so yeah 122 so like you're you're aiming for oldest human to have have ever lived I don't think that's going to be crazy uncommon for Our Generation to have a hand to so you have this stat in there you say that um you said that you are more likely to be a billionaire of which there are something like 3,000 you're more likely to be a billionaire than you are to be someone who lives to be 110 or above of which there's like 800 or 1,000 or something like that exactly um but I think that's going to be way more common um like we've had a lot of really smart people on this podcast and they were like I just and they they they just tell these stories where I'm not smart enough to understand the data but I talk to smart people and they say things like they don't think it's going to be particularly uncommon to have uh 110 115 120 in the next 50 or so years well there's actually like yeah in the book they kind of break down that basically the calculus around if you make it to 100 um there's a certain percent chance that you make it to 110 versus 120 Etc we don't know 130 because people haven't really made it there but if you just do the same math around like okay instead of having a thousand people make it to 100 if we then have a 100,00 people make it to 100 or a million people make it to 100 then like you just you take those same percentages and you're like oh actually yeah then we're for sure going to have like let's say instead of one person making it to 120 something you have let's say 50 right um and in that case it's like well then we're going to get some data on it likely you know not all of them are just going to drop at one is it 122 um some of them are going to make it dude all and all of this bums me out because it makes you realize how short life is um like a 100 years is not a long time it's not it's not a long time so at at 30 years old uh we you know you are you're you're a good chunk of the way through your life already even though I feel like a child still yeah it's just it's life is I think I I felt this particularly when I had a baby because I saw how fast she grew where we're at the stage now where every two weeks like there's like a a different brain like some some like just the other day she woke up and um she now knows how to high five or like little small things like oh wow now she knows how to mimic she really can mimic and then I'll look at photos of her just three months ago and I'm like she didn't even have really any hair uh or like the idea of like mimicking that wasn't even part of the equation and so you go through this thing of having a kid and you're like that's nothing like it's just like this it's going so fast 100 years is nothing or I do the math and I'm like at the age of 40 when she's 40 I'm going to be uh 75 which means if I continue having kids for the next six years I'm going to be in my 80s uh when they're in their 30s and 40s and that just seems insane to me that seems insane right by the way have you seen the smile curve around happiness no how older people just generally tend to be happy so people tend to be happy early in life and then in mid mid years there's this like they call it the smile curve because like generally they become a little less happy and then that curve goes like up and up and up um as people get older which is really interesting um I don't know exactly what to take away from that other than like well the takeaway is that you spend your 30s and 40s giving a about what other people think climbing the ladder yeah um and you want to flex on others and and then uh but when you're 10 and 15 you care about that a little bit less and then at the age of 1 40 you sacrifice your values in order to appease other people and to climb up this ladder and then at the age of 50 60 70 you have grandkids and you realize none of that matters that's what that's what I that's my assumption yeah I mean people can interpret a lot from that but I agree I think there's something around like you learn a lot about what to care about and what not to care about and then you're happy Steph Smith thank you very much for doing the Pod we appreciate you thank you by the way can I say something really quick um which is just the last time I was on just a shout out to the listeners like you we talked about so the product that I had launched a year ago internet pipes for like 30 seconds at the end of a an hour plus long podcast how much revenue did you make off that off that I'm pretty sure it's hard to tie directly like but for sure six figures which is crazy um so I just want to shout out to to the folks and all the people who listen who are in Internet pipes and all that um so Internet pipes.com it's like um it's a it kind of started as like a book but now it's a community right it's a community we run events that are kind of weird and quirky weird fruit tastings we did like electric shuffle board documentary screening so it's cool um we can do a code if do people pay for the events no no no no so it's a onetime thing and then you're in the community you get access to the events that um we do monthly emails so again I'm the one I'm sending is on longevity last month it was basically just took our idea from Trend and you uh did it on your own you said it I didn't say it um but actually the point was around internet pipes was meant to be a little different in the sense of Trends was like here are the trends internet pipes is meant to be here are the tools so that you can Surface your own Trends as well like you know behind the scenes how the sandwich is made this is this is awesome uh you owe me uh a dinner then oh totally a fair more than more than a dinner and we can set up that's all I'll take I'll accept a dinner uh that's a fair trade and if future people want to join they can um sign up we can set up a code why don't we just do Sam Sam I'm on your website right now Sam is a good code uh it looks like it hasn't been used um all right internet pipes.com use the code Sam Steph we're giving you all this plugs man congratulations you guys are the best um all right I'll talk to you a little bit all right see you [Music]

I watched this grenade come over the wall it's like I can see it for a second it disappeared I can see it for a second and it was like time absolutely Stood Still and when I was in this Blackness of not seeing and not hearing I knew absolutely that this is death I had mental issues I had emotional issues I had real physical issues I was a complete psychopath and when I got out I thought social media and content creation was just kind of fascinating how did you decide that was or the way to spend your life if you create the right thing at the right time it's like a lottery ticket and it goes viral and then it's your chance at that point to capitalize in whatever way you want to so I was obsessed with it so despite the many failures over the course of probably you know 6 months or so maybe a year of just like awful cringe videos that went nowhere on a whim I was like you know what I'm just going to shoot a quick video and I leave my phone in the room for a couple hours come back and I couldn't even open my phone and it had over 5 million views in a matter of a few hours so you built this Empire quickly I went into this feverish like constantly telling stories on Tik Tok uh 3 a day for 30 days and then was up to like 7 million subscribers on Tik Tok and then shifted to YouTube and here we are what's one thing you could teach me to make be a better Storyteller it's something that people love and hate if you're going to tell a [Music] story Sean uh have you have you ever uh seen the Mr Ballin channel before like I asked you if he should come on no when I found out you were coming on as a guest that's when the research started and I went to your Tik Tok first and then I went to YouTube and then I started watching some other stuff but I love the genre but I'm not like crazy about it my brother-in-law is nuts about these spooky stories he does something I don't even understand you you got to explain this to me there's apparently a YouTube channel that takes spooky stories from Reddit and then reads it like texting speech like robotic text to speech and he'll listen to this thing for like two hours straight I can't believe that he does this but when I saw that I was like oh that's like people who are far on the deep end of loving this type of content i' I've definitely have done like on a Saturday where I've got to do chores or something like that run errands I've done a six to eight hour marathon of Ballin of Mr Ballin what's your consumption rate on your Channel right now is it just through the roof that's a Nick question so Nick Nick does everything with the exception of telling the stories on camera uh I'm like completely out of the loop with virtually everything else I just I sit down and tell stories and Nick Nick is the guy for literally every other question in terms of like growth of the channel like metrics that's Nick that's Nick's wheelhouse dude that's Nirvana for Content where you can just sit down you just record and then you disappear and everything else happens magically that is the every content creator wants that I we'll get to this but he came in when I didn't know how to like grow my channel Beyond just me and like I was so burned out Nick came in when it was me and I think I had an editor and maybe like a topic finder and that was like overwhelming for me you know it's like I was deleting all emails that came in people trying to like do business with me I just delete everything so I had no idea how to like figure out if it was good or not and Nick came in and was like y d I'll help you and and he grew the business how big were you when that happened we were like significant on YouTube but I personally was at a place where I was I mean just jumping in I mean I was it took me about 26 hours give her take to make one video in the first six months I was on YouTube and I was doing anywhere from three to five videos a week and at the same time you know I I'm married I have three young kids I completely was negligent in all duties besides content my wife is a saint and picked up everything else but I was doing you know I mean do the math 20 said like over a hundred hours of just constant grinding like at all hours and so even though the channel was you know in the millions and we were you know by all accounts had like made it as as a YouTube channel I was so close to being like dude this ain't worth it like I'm in my 30s I got a family like I've done well for myself but this is like the worst thing ever and it was around that time that I'm like maybe all those people that are emailing me maybe they can offer something that will help me like grow because I I swear to God I was just Mass deleting emails because it was so stressful like people that were like trying to pitch me and I saw an email come through that was like you know fellow combat veteran here to help and and I had like I'm a a military guy and I'm immediately like okay this guy could talk to I don't know who he is I don't know what he means by help but I open his email and he's like yeah you know I I'm I'm a day-to-day manager with Mr Beast I I have experience in traditional Talent you know I'm not looking to sign you not looking to really do anything but I just saw you know your vet it's rare in the space and I'd be happy to help and so like I immediately hit him up and I'm like I don't know you but my life's falling apart here man like I got all all this great stuff happening with YouTube but I can't manage it like I'm losing my mind and so that that began what turned out to be the the reason the Mr Ballin thing did Not Fade Into Obscurity I mean I'm a great Storyteller but I'm I cannot I cannot grow a business I I couldn't have done this longer than like literally that month remember talking to my wife and being like I just don't know if this is worth it but Nick came in and and I handed the Reigns of virtually everything over to Nick and and he scaled the company we have like 50 plus employees now we got a slate of shows I show up to the studio and just somebody else hits record and I just tell stories and I leave because of Nick the thing too Johnny it's like every Creator on the planet it's like you start it all by yourself everything lives and dies on their shoulders and so even just letting someone in to tweak a title or or give advice on a thumbnail is just like the the highest level of of anxiety that creators can have too did he say that you were working with Mr Beast before that yeah yeah so I got hired for to be the right hand for the CEO over at night media and so Reed was Jimmy's you know main man manager and I got recruited to go be Jimmy's number two or Reed's number two and I was running day-to-day with Mr B so and before that I no no clue about anything on YouTube so I was like learning everything from Michael Jordan of YouTube and then I was applying it in real time in real practice and before that I was in law school became a lawyer in a military stint so Nick also when he got out of the military so he does 90 combat missions in Iraq as an open turret Gunner so I don't know if you're familiar with this nowadays when you're overseas you are in you're an enclosed bombproof like M wrap this huge up armored 60,000 ton vehicle with literally a remote controlled gun that has a screen in front of you that's how they do it now Nick was in a rock when it's an open turret like it's just you hanging it out there and the turret Gunners are the number one target like as you're rolling through on patrol so Nick is doing this Extremely Dangerous Mission set comes back from Iraq gets out of the military goes to law school which is a whole thing and then he ends up deciding he wants to get into entertainment law but he has no idea how so he just begins pestering WME one of the biggest talent agencies in the world to like let him work for them no one's taking his calls they're like he's showing up in his one raggedy suit that he's got like trying to make an impression he's fre yolked dude with tattoos all over him no one wants him he finally gets the attention of one of the partners who's like all right dude you come here all the time like you can work in the mail room pushing the mail cart and the dude quickly ascended and was like working with with with Talent like killing it so Nick is a highly persistent dude who just does what he wants it's pretty amazing we got to know Jimmy because we do we do an event with him every year we call it Camp MFM and uh I would say the the first year we met him his crew was a lot of like his friends or like his cousin and like and that's great because you get like high loyalty and like camaraderie and all that but the operations were obviously like bust busting at the seams because he's growing so fast and every single person there has never done anything like this before and for a lot of them never done anything before it's like you're you're all 23 you're all 24 everybody was so young we went back this year and his right-hand man Shawn is this guy who's like Sean Hendrick sounds like it reminds of you already Nick I think he is ex ex-military as well he uh was just like super operational just an adult in the room and just had this like grind mindset and like you isn't like enamored by the idea of Mr Beast it's not like isn't trying to be a part of the cool scene sees it as an operation that needs to be run well and I you could just tell his whole life got better by surrounding himself with more people like that Sam I don't know if I ever told you the story but we for one of our companies we hired a ex-military guy to be like our kind of like head of customer service or something like that it was like an at was a remote job he could do at home I think he had like a leg injury so this was like a good thing for him and this guy transformed our entire business like first he started in customer service but he would just notice everything is broken because you know it's a Sean company if everything is broken and so he would find that the next thing's broken and he would just be dming me in slack by the way the best part was he wouldn't make you feel bad about fixing stuff he would just give me these like military phrases he'd be like slow is smooth and smooth is fast he' just hit me like that in the morning and then I would be like I don't really know where that applies but I think it applies to everything in my life now and he was like my guiding uh you know Mentor basically from the customer service department it was amazing all right so a lot of people watch and listen to the show because they want to hear us just tell them exactly what to do when it comes to starting or growing a business and really a lot of people who are listening they have a full-time job and they want to start something on the side a side hustle now a lot of people message Sean and I and they say all right I want to start something on the side is this a good idea is that a good idea and again what they're really just saying is just give me the ideas well my friends you're in luck so my old company the hustle they put together a hundred different side hustle ideas and they have appropriately called it the side hustle idea database it's a list of 100 pretty good ideas frankly I went through them they're awesome and it gives you how to start them how to grow them things like that gives you a little bit of inspiration so check it out it's called the side hustle idea database it's in the description below you'll see the link click it check it out let me know in the comments what you think well I think John went on Chris Williamson's pod and he told the story where um I think a grenade exploded near you and you almost died and it was a really bad situation and you're like it was kind of cool though because I saw tens of millions of dollars worth of Elite Training go into play because when I got hurt my guys like did exactly what they were supposed to do and it was like uh it was like clockwork where you're like it's so cool I can actually see all of this actually happening and I guess I mean with a lot of the military guys it seems that goes into play with business particularly when they're like dude I'm used to grenades this shit's easy yeah it's true a grenade basically landed between myself and a few of my other teammates it detonates one of the things that happens in in my limited experience in combat is you can get shot several times you don't just immediately collapse to the ground unless it's like a head shot or something you can get shot and become a superhuman for like 30 seconds it's it's it's one of the most bizarre things and it's like we're engaging these guys and in this absolute chaos they lobed the grenades over the wall to our side and I remember I watched this grenade come over the wall it's like I can see it for a second it disappeared I can see it for a second and it was like time absolutely stood stood still it's not some I'm not making that up but that's that was my experience it's like I'm witnessing my death Here Comes This grenade I know it's a grenade it's like my my my my brain has become hyperfocused on what's Happening and I remember thinking as it came closer to my head this all happened in a fraction of a second I remember thinking boy if it detonates here it's going to blow my head off and I won't be my mom won't be able to identify me like I just hope this Falls below my head so even though it's going to kill me at least they can see my face I can have an open casket my family can see me but you know it reached my head and I'm just embra embracing for death and then you know it's lights out lights on lights out lights on it falls it hits my shoulder and it goes and begins to travel down to the ground I remember having this thought of when it was at my torso again in this fraction of a second thinking few my my face will be intact and now it's going to blow me in half but at least my mom will see her son's face but it makes it to the ground and now I'm thinking holy cow like it might just blow my legs off I might live through this uh it hits the ground and it detonates and I can only I can only compare it to um first of all I'm prepared to die at this point so I was just ready for whatever happened there was no pain involved but it felt like somebody took a handful of rocks and just threw them as hard as they could at my back and and my my hips and my legs and it was Zero pain like it wasn't even really shock even though we're we are all the seven of us in the lethal range of this grenade we just think that it was basically muffled or deadened slightly by being in sewage by the way I got ecoli as a result of this because sewage was shot into my body but yeah I collapsed to the ground and then my uh and then all hell broke loose I mean of the seven of us that were behind this wall six become incapacitated down to the ground like unconscious or badly hurt our medic who also is a seal he he's incredible his name is Kyle he he would tell us later on that everybody goes down he knows that there's multiple Enemy enemy combatants literally on the other side of the wall and he's like I just went into flow you know he he began rescuing us under a hail of gunfire and so rounds are coming in Rockets are being fired overhead I'm barely conscious and and our medic just began pulling people out under the Halo gunfire my memory which it would take years to learn what actually happened because my memory was not accurate was I felt like the the Rocks hitting me and then I kind of like looked up and was waiting for a combatant to come into the the alleyway we were in and finish me off and then like somehow or another I was pulled like 10 20 feet away and brought into this Alleyway and then Kyle the medic wound up putting tourniquet on my legs and saving my life but years after the fact Kyle and I we didn't speak following this this whole thing it was like so traumatic we we came back to the United States separately we didn't talk for four years uh it it effed with all of us but when I sat down with him he would tell me that after the impact after the the detonation he said I looked and I saw you on the ground and I thought at first you were on a sheet of ice and he was like that doesn't make any sense because there's it's not cold enough and he was like that's when I realized you were actually in a puddle of blood you were face down and I assumed you were dead and in terms of triaging the situation like I couldn't workot you you were the lowest chance of survival and he was like I left you to die you know I thought you were dead already and then after the others had basically been pulled out you know somebody came back and pulled me up and I remember like being sort of In and Out Of Consciousness and this this my memory of this I think was fairly accurate because I got brought basically here's the tea I got brought like to the stem of the tea if you will we're still getting shot at and I I have these they're called quick release tourniquets sitting on my kit they're they're they're literally on you so that you can quickly access them to stop the bleeding that you actually put them here to save your life and I didn't have the strength to break the rubber bands because I'd lost so much blood and so I'm sitting there no one's with me yet I've just been dragged here and left and you know rounds are coming into the alleyway and I uh I had this moment where I could see everything I could hear everything but then my vision completely went I went I couldn't see anything and I could only hear and then the hearing turned into what sounded like helicopter like then I went to nothing and I had this this point where it's I'm in a void can't see anything can't hear anything I know I'm alive still but it's I compare it to when I was seven years old and I I fell rollerblading and I I badly broke my collar bone and the second I hit the ground I stood up and I said to my dad I broke my collar bone and like I'm seven I don't think I ever I ever even thought about the fact that I had a collar bone or even knew that that was called a collarbone but it was like your brain is like yep that's what happened it's something traumatic and you know it immediately and when I was in this Blackness of not seeing and not hearing I knew absolutely that this is death like absolutely it was just matter of fact and I couldn't believe it like I just got married me and my wife had put off the idea of having kids until after this deployment and I'm like I can't believe that's what's going to happen I'm G to die here and my one of my final thoughts was I wonder if in the newspaper will it say John be Allen like killed an action or will it say Jonathan be Allen it was like just weird thoughts of like huh you know will will my will my obituary make a national newspaper or just a local paper like when are they're going to tell my wife it was just so weirdly matter of fact and it struck me that like just as much as you know how to live without thinking too hard about it it's the only thing we know you are ready to die you just don't know it yet when you face that I imagine you have some type of questioning of like like how do I want to spend my time life's short things like that does that mental Clarity kind of carry with you for for a decade honestly it has oddly enough even though I tried out and became a seal I actually felt like I was somebody that was constantly turning down opportunities in fear of failure and it was almost like overcompensation to go try out to be a seal to like internally write that or balance that out like I had shot down so many opportunities but after this near-death experience it's like anytime There's an opportunity no matter how big no matter how scary no matter the opportunity to fail I do actively think about the fact that like bro you're going to die and it's it's going to happen and it's going to be matter of fact and it's going to feel like holy [ __ ] I can't believe I'm dying and and that's it that's the end and and that is the thing that I think about just like not the fragility of life but the matter of fact of dying the same way we live every day and we don't think about it you don't wake up and think oh I better live today you just do it the same [ __ ] happens when you die and it's going to happen when you probably aren't even expecting it like there you go you're done and so I I carry that and just to close the loop there after I got uh metac and was safe they they debrief you after you're met when you're taken out of country for an injury and they asked me like so what are your takeaways now that you've survived this ordeal and I said to the the commanding officer I'm like you know what in real time I watched what Navy Seals do Under Fire not me I was completely worthless I'm like incapacity on the ground but I watched millions and millions and millions of dollars in training like in practice and it was beautiful it was like the training works and so that's actually used as a quote by that guy that he's said the training works this guy said so when you're deciding to build Mr Ballin Mr Ballin Studio first of all going into business going into content creation and then building a media company how did you decide that was worthy a worthy way to spend your life basically I fell backwards into this I mean I I got out of the military in 2017 it was a medical retirement that was due in large part to this injury I've just described I I wound up deploying one more time in the team but I had mental issues I had emotional issues I had real physical issues I was a complete psychopath by the time I was being effectively told it's time for you to to wrap it up here in the Navy and when I got out in an effort to get myself a civilian job I wound up connecting with this guy named Jordan celik who's this investment banker in New York turned entrepreneur and he's like man you got a network and so I started like going on LinkedIn and networking didn't even know what I was doing I was just like randomly messaging random people but before long I had like met enough people that there was this idea to have a networking event in New York and so I I I invited some people that were also leaving the SEAL Teams to come with me to meet some business people in New York it was like pretty open-ended and I I wound up giving a couple of you know I guess a speech if you will at this like weird event with like 50 people we called it Elite meet was the name of the event and it was meant to just be this onetime event I gave this talk about hey you know in the room right now we have these veterans and like here's what they bring to the table and Jordan who was there with me he talked about what the business people had and what what offered opportunities they were looking to fill and and it was great like a few people got hired as a result but ironically nobody was asking me about getting a job because the Assumption was this is your job you run this networking event and so I ended up making that my job and for a couple of years I I was the CEO of of elite meet but to to shorten the story the pandemic happened and our our our our charity was largely event-based you know we literally had these big networking events that we would you know cultivate over many months and we couldn't do events anymore because no one could do anything the world shut down uh and it was around that time that I was sort of looking at other Pathways to to I don't know to live my life and I thought social media and content creation was just kind of fascinating as I mean it's it's one of the few places where it's fairly obvious that you know unless you really buy into this idea that algorithms are like totally you know leaning one way or the other ultimately content creation is a big meritocracy you know ultimately you can create content with no platform no no no nothing and if if you create the right thing at the right time it's like a lottery ticket and it goes viral and then it's your chance at that point to capitalize in whatever way you want to and I tried uh I tried cashing that lottery ticket for a while doing some cringe like weird sketch comedy on on Instagram and and Linkedin and I was doing like dance videos I'm like a middle-aged dude doing dance videos on on Tik Tok getting made fun of it it was horrible it was like nothing work I was like boy I got this I'm GNA be a content creator but I I had this this document on my computer I had two documents there was like Tik Tok ideas or content ideas and on one document it was like I'm not kidding P like 50 pages of single space just bullets of ideas of types of content I could create and then I had this other document that had a single word on it or it was like a single bullet point and and it just said de laav of pass um so deav of pass is this very famous uh mystery about these hikers in the 1950s who go missing in the year old mountains and yeah they're very exper exped hikers and that wind up missing and then they're found and there's these photos of their campsite and it's been you know desecrated and their bodies are found and they're like wearing each other's clothes body parts are missing they're they're uh they're radioactive um there were there was one person that was like tucked up in a tree and there was all these scratch marks at the base of the tree this is like in the middle of like the EUR old mountains like it's just snow and ice everywhere and that same night like there was a a Soviet military movement happening and and one of the people who was in charge who had no idea about these missing hikers made a report that he had never made before that happened to coincide with the same time these hikers went missing where he said you know I I see these lights that are basically coming up and down and flashing over over this section of the mountain like pretty far away from our position and that this guy was trying to find out is there another military movement happening or is another country invading us and so it turns out there wasn't and no one knows what those lights were and no one knows what happened to these hikers and so it's this great mystery and I thought it was fascinating and that's the content that I like like when I go on the internet to look at video when I'm eating my lunch that's what I'm going to watch I'm going to watch videos like that and to date I had been trying to mimic other people's content style I was just copying stuff and trying to hit it big on social media and it was just not going well at all how many other videos do you think you made before you had that that kind of hit and you found your lane because I think this is really important a lot of people expect to just know their Lane up front or hit early on and even if intellectually they realize I probably will have to do trial and error even failing like seven eight nine time 11 times in a row is completely demoralizing for for for the average person so how many videos do you think you made before you popped off on Tik Tok specifically uh there's a slightly bigger version to the story because there was a time where in between 2017 when I got when I was medically retired and 2020 when I post this this video that goes viral we were using social media specifically LinkedIn to try to drum up support for elite me we would basically tell stories in in text format with a picture attached to it about veterans that were leaving the military and I would kind of like write stories about their experiences and like anecdotally how they connected to why they'd be a good fit in these types of Industries and it was it was very successful not viral but it raised we raised like half a million dollars on micro donations that stemmed from these posts that we were doing me and Jordan in particular my co-founder um and so I had gotten call it a taste of what social media can do nothing like you know what Mr Mr Ballin is but it was like using social media as a real tool and I remember sometime in like 2018 and 19 you know we're doing all this content that's really centered on Veterans and drawing you know donations for this charity uh and I decided to kind of selfishly in tandem begin posting very similar content like anecdotal military experience type of content but my own and with not the intention of drawing support to Elite meet necessarily although that was kind of like incidental it was more like building my own personal brand as like the Navy SEAL uh and I drew the eye of the entire uh Navy SEAL Community yeah dude seals hate that don't they which is like super unfair because uh you know I've read the book about the guy who killed Bin Laden I forget his name and then there's gogin and a lot of these guys my seal friends they talk [ __ ] about people who use Navy SEAL as a story and I understand their perspective their perspective is like it's us like we don't talk about this we all do this together but then I understand the other perspective of like yeah but like you just served your country and you almost died and like you're probably likely looking at like not that awesome of a life after you retire because you're you're bummed out about what you experience and there's a whole bunch of [ __ ] why like you know it doesn't look awesome once you once you get out and so I understand that perspective like dude take what you can get and get ahead so it's a CH you're in a tough spot yeah and and unfortunately you know it was a and a curse because in a way when I began posting you know text stories of you know how I was I wasn't intending to come off as like Mr Navy SEAL but that's entirely how it came off and once I made that shift I was like I'm going to delete all the seal content and start start a new and just try my hand at something that is completely divorced from being a seal I posted I I had probably hundreds of videos that were like I mean some did relatively well get a couple hundred or a thousand views but like I I it nothing was turning into anything and but I also I have this sort of obsessive quality when I want to do something and it's it's definitely what you know allowed me to become a seal it's like you if you want to be if you want to be really good at something you kind you kind of have to only do that and I had this idea that like I really want to do something with social media and so I was obsessed with it so despite the many failures over the course of probably you know six months or so maybe a year of just like awful cringe videos that went nowhere I had like reached a point where my wife was like dude you got to like figure something else out here this is not really going anywhere she was very diplomatic about it but we got three young kids or we had two at the time but I was at this water park in Pennsylvania This indoor water park with my wife and kids and on a whim I was like you know what I'm G just gonna shoot a quick video the 60c talk about the diaa pass and so I film it in my hotel room and I leave my phone in the room because we're going down to the water park and I didn't have a way to waterproof it leave my phone me me and my wife and kids we go down to the water park we're there for a couple hours come back and I couldn't even open my phone there was so many notifications pouring in for this one video on my Tik Tok account that had no following it was like this brand new account basically and it had over five million views in a matter of a few hours and I was like holy cow like as you guys have seen in this podcast I I love to talk love to tell stories maybe I can just keep doing this on Tik Tok and so I went into this feverish like constantly telling stories on Tik Tok uh three a day for 30 days and then was up to like 7 million subscrib was on Tik Tok and then shifted to YouTube and here we are well let me tell you one thing this is going to tell you a little bit about you and a lot about me you told two stories just now yeah you told a story of you representing our country nearly dying in war being saved by the Navy Seals facing a life or death experience and I was like I like this story then you talked about how you came home you got on LinkedIn you started uh using your your the easy but button to try to post you know content and then you admitted you were like I didn't want to be doing that but I was doing that and I didn't care I wanted to do it anyways and then people [ __ ] on me for it and it felt really bad and they were right yeah and I was like I ride with this guy I love this guy because uh there are so few people on Earth there are few people on Earth who have lived through war and and survived there might be even fewer people who can look at their actions and say yeah I don't think and not give themselves the benefit of the doubt right everybody gives themselves the benit everyone gives themselves the charitable interpretation I really love how honest you were about what you were doing and how that might have been like something you weren that that you're not proud of how you did it and how you you know ultimately where it landed you which was like through doing that you're like all right I want to do storytelling social media maybe you kind of had a taste of it but then you tried to make it by copying what others were doing on Tik Tock and only when you did the thing that was like the intersection of like you know what you're good at and what the world is interested in you found that authentic point where now you know there's nobody else doing what you were doing or very few people were doing what you were what you were doing there so I think there's a lot to learn from that how big um is your guys's company now I know you have 40 people and you're like just what do you have eight nine million on YouTube and then three million on Facebook and I don't even know how much on Tik Tok now uh a shitload with the Mr ball foundation and you know um 1099 contractors that end of rolling up into W2s we're almost around 55 and then I would say fanwise you know he's got 9 plus million on YouTube A Plus million on Tik Tok three and a half on Facebook Snapchat you name it so I think oh and then you have the podcast which does you know eight figures in downloads a month and so I mean I would say the the range is about 25 million in fans just for the strange dark mysterious God damn so so you built this Empire quickly and you know when I do these podcasts I wake up and I think all right what am I excited to talk about and learn about genuinely what am I actually selfishly interesting because that's what makes for the best podcast honestly because it's that's the conversation I really want to have and the one thing I wanted to learn from you was like you you've built this Media company and you do these kind of like strange dark and mysterious stories I don't do those stories I'm not necessarily trying to build media company but there was one thing you said that really stood out to me when I was kind of going down the rabbit hole and it's around what is the mindset that's helped you become successful that I could take even if I'm trying to do something completely different right how can I learn from you guys how can I learn from a seal and the mindset that that it took to be successful there that it took to be successful with your media company that I might use elsewhere and you said something that was great uh you were on our buddy Chris's podcast and you said he was asking you about you know being in a rut or how do you not get stuck and you said you know one thing I'm good at is if I find something you I have a basic outline of what I want to do as long as something something checks enough of the boxes I don't overthink it because you said most people or you know other people could sit there in question what you know you have something that that you think might work and you could sit there and question and say is there some alternative that's slightly better is there something that would check more boxes or or how would this work and get caught up in the details I really love that mindset because I think that is a every entrepreneur has been guilty of that once if not is stuck there can you talk a little bit about that mindset what what did you mean by that and um any maybe examples of how you approach that sure um so I mean to be clear definitely in terms of getting the business to 55 employees with a slate of shows that wasn't me I I might be the the the face of it but but Nick is is absolutely the architect and the guy who runs the business um but just relative to like you know my role in this company yeah I think that what I was getting at with Chris Williamson was this idea that you know we are inundated we like anybody online uh are inundated off times with like these pretty action but the idea is like there are so many things that anybody at any time could pursue whether it's career relationship hobby you name it like there's an infinite number of things in some ways that you could you could do and people are like well is it what's the ROI if I do this whatever it is and I don't think that I set out to be this way out of strategy I think it's just who I am which is like if it's good enough just start doing it and so for me like I had this idea and so I I have a baseline of things I care about I want something to be hard enough that if I do it I'll feel really proud of doing that thing like if it's easy it's not going to make me excited at the end like it needs to be a challenge so something that's hard something that comes with some level of like this is going to sound vain but I think we're all pretty human here some level of recognition for doing the thing it's not the reason you do it but you do want people to be aware that you struggled and built this thing you did this thing you owned this thing whatever it is so it's like has to be hard has to have some level of people being aware this is again my my Baseline people people being aware of me accomplishing it and then also I want to have some level of enjoyment doing it the Navy SEAL Teams are a good example of one of those things that checked those boxes for me like prior to trying out for the SEAL Teams I had sort of got my act together and managed to graduate college there was a time where I definitely was not on that path my my mom wrote my college essay to the college that accepted me my grades were so bad but the essay was so good she's a professional writer that the college actually contacted me and was like your grades are not enough but boy that essay you're in the door buddy and I immediately like got I got in all this trouble my first anyways I was on this path to like flunking out of college and being that guy that totally peaked in high school um but when I was back home in quinsey Massachusetts just south of Boston Mass I was like in my mom's basement after FL basically flunking out of school and getting in trouble I I wound up realizing that you know hey if you want to graduate college like you got to do it yourself you you need to own your [ __ ] up and and like go to school and do it and so I I managed to graduate I took some local local classes went back to the old University I graduated I get my degree but I had no idea what I wanted to do after college like none I majored in philosophy with a minor in English because there was no pre-law degree because I sort of convinced myself that maybe I'll be a lawyer I was like what am I going to do and I I just I I had feeling of like well man it was really cool to like pick myself up by the bootstraps and and like graduate On My Own Strength here and I began looking for opportunities to to kind of continue doing stuff like that and that's where I kind of developed this mindset of look for things that are hard look for things that come with some level of recognition and things that I might enjoy doing and I found the SEAL Teams it's like I had always been kind of enamored with the military uh a lot of my classmates in high school they After High School joined the Marines and went off to fight in the war and I actually always sort of felt a little bit guilty that I went to college on my mom's essay and pissed it all away and yeah I graduated but I always had the sort of like deep down guilt that I didn't you know volunteer at the time that many of my friends did and so I kind of idolized them I also looked at the SEAL Teams as being this thing that like just about anybody you know within reason can try out for the SEAL Teams it's not something that requires a whole lot to get in the door I'm I'm generalizing but it is relatively easy to try out but it is exceptionally hard to graduate and so perfect it's got this incredible Challenge and then if you become a seal well guess what no one's going to be like yeah but John screwed up in college and it just felt like wow like that checks every box for me and I went that way and I and I became a seal and then you know after after the military I I still had that kind of mindset of looking for things that I wanted to do that would be hard some level of recognition and enjoy and have some enjoyment and I thought social media was it it just felt like a big challenge you know to like get noticed by the world I know that like I I think your father is a is a big shot journalist from uh the the Boston Globe I think and your your mom and sister are as well were you motivated by like just creating cool [ __ ] or were you motivated At All by money because I haven't I mean there's this phrase like king or Rich so it's like do you want to be like famous do you want to be like famous or do you want to be rich um I mean to be honest like when for example when I was trying really hard post deleting all the seal stuff like when I was trying to like find something on Tik Tok between dancing and cringe stuff I was doing I I don't think I necessarily had an exact goal in mind because I truthfully didn't know where it was going to take me I I had low expectations I think that I looked at it because I was 30 at the time you I'm not like an 18yearold I'm not throwing shade on 18 year olds but when I was 18 if I was doing social media it was for fame like be cool like be the cool guy but when I was doing it I actually was mostly probably leaning towards money in terms of make this a livelihood I have kids I'm married like this would be a really fun way to make a living but I definitely did not have the thought that this will be an Empire worth millions of dollars I was thinking like boy wouldn't it be great if this supplemented my income you know and then only when you know this really frankly blew up I actually I was somewhere in between recognition and money in the sense that I clearly saw this is when Nick comes into the picture and I'm like about to give it all up and we end up kind of like sinking and we're like okay we're going to build this thing it was more like the fun of the challenge which includes if you're successful you can be famous if you're successful you can make lots of money you can have generational wealth but for me like more than anything it was this idea that like I want to do something that's really [ __ ] hard to do I would say of all the Baseline elements I gave you those are the things most drawn to often times and so that is the thing if it was easy at a certain point to be Mr balling and and grow in notoriety and make more money I wouldn't be interested in doing it those are byproducts of the challenge that I often seek Sean whenever I hang out with Guys Like These Guys these ex-military guys I feel inspired I also feel super [ __ ] soft do do feel that same way dude that's not just with military guys I feel that with the average guys this is of course yes I feel that way well I like what he said about like having a highest order bit know like the the orienting function like what is your true north and his true north is basically like it sounds like you're like looking for giant mountains to go climb like Summit you're like what's the what's the hard thing that I would feel proud of myself if I did and then I know other people would be proud and respect me too if they did it and as a byproduct of doing the hard thing I'm sure there's rewards yes John's always been like that yeah exactly and it sounds like the seals like that conquering social media although it sounds goofy like Tik Tok or whatever it's one of the most competitive Merit based things you could compete in what's a race that a billion people are competing in you know that that's one of the few and so like Sam what is your what's your version of that what's the highest order uh you know the orienting thing when you decide what are you gonna what are you going to devote your time and your talents to do you know I mean mine was mine's empty it's still empty which is it was just like money to provide for my family but once you get past that like it is quite you're empty when you don't have that and I still I'm still oftentimes I'm like I need this I need direction and so that's why when I hear these guys I'm like I feel a sense of Envy a bit that they have a Direction but I feel slightly directionless do you at the beginning it was like prove myself early 20s then like late 20s was like yo I'd like to have like a million dollars in the bank uh you know like some money became like the thing let me get to million 10 million and the the Richer person I met I would be like oh yeah I need that much money and then early 30s popping out kids I real I I went to Lifestyle I was like oh actually it's a certain amount of money but actually it's I don't want more money with more stress and time I want like the maximum amount of time least amount of stress but still be able to do whatever the hell I want so enough money to do that so that what I would call lifestyle and now I'm 36 and in the last year I've basically shifted that North again and by the way I don't think it's bad to shift your North I think you have seasons of life and chapters of life and you should they're all not all the same you know like having a lot of fun was really important in college for me that was the true north right now it's basically enjoyment so what I'm trying to do is figure out what is the most me thing I could do like you were saying these are the stories I'm interested in and you come from a background I think your parents are like storytellers and it's probably something you learn through osmosis I I think about it like this what what can I do that's just simply me pushed out to the world that is my most my highest orienting function and then the the filter is basically am I doing this because doing it is the reward or am I doing this for some future rewards and most of my life I did things for future rewards I went to college so I could get a good job and I got a good job so I can make some money I got some money so that I could buy this thing everything was this future payoff and now I'm like oh wait I don't need to do that trade that's a little silly why don't I just do things where the act of doing it is the reward if there happens to be other byproducts in the future great but I can't do things that I don't really want to do or kind of suck today because I think they might pay off in the future I don't do those anymore this podcast is the best thing I've ever done and when I started it I was basically like I'm going to lose I plan I wrote down in my plan this will this should lose about10 to $220,000 a year I'm com I'm comfortable with that was like the only like non not only just won't make me Rich I planned for it to make me slightly poorer every year doing it and ironically this is the thing that's done the best it's been the most successful of all the projects and I'm willing to do it forever this is the only thing I do that I'm not looking to exit right like I'm not looking to sell this and and like then I'll be able to relax and retire it's like no no I kind of want to keep doing the Pod you'd have to pay me to stop do you guys have uh for Mr ball in studios do you guys have this like North Star in terms of how many people you're going to reach or how big the company's going to get or is this a business that you're like man one day we could sell this for like $200 million yeah what do you what do you label the top of the mountain or like how do what what's the height of of of the mountain you're trying to climb here the North Star I would say for the company as far as you know being a manager it's always what's your client's North Star that's your North Star and then as CEO it's still that but it's what's you know what's John and I's north star from the studio his vision then I Implement and execute well that's the noble sounding thing John what's what's the dirty selfish ego driven goal you have yeah like surely you guys are sure surely you guys are sit down and you're like man I think at five years we could do 100 million in Revenue my New Year's resolution is to like you know build healthy habits but there's the dirty selfish goal of like I want to take my shirt off and see some ABS baby like come on I won't say that but like that's what that's part of it for sure so I will say that before all this happened before I was in college I always aspired to be I played baseball growing up not at a very high level I played through high school but I was like really good in my hometown you know at one point I uh I really believed that I could potentially play for the Boston Red Sox that's like my favorite team and I so now you want to own them there's I would think that is in terms of a selfish goal yeah like that would be the thing I would want to own a piece of the Red Sox but actually I was going to an analogy and then I was going to double back to that when that dream was shattered uh sometime I remember my senior year of high school I just like said it out loud I'm like yeah I'm probably not going to play for the B in Red Socks and I was like oh [ __ ] like that's true like I'm not like the dream is over but um I always just like thought about like that was the dream that that was my childhood dream like pitch for the Boston Red Sox that was it and so now like that we're at this place you know ball and Studios is at this place where you know when he's talking about recruiting the best storytellers in the world it's it's actually a little bit different than recruiting I look at us and this this is my take my shirt off show you the truth I look at us as like I'll put it this way if you if you're a baseball player you're an amateur baseball player like I was you don't aspire to be the best independent baseball player in the world that you're going to be by yourself just being the best you want to play for the [ __ ] Boston Red Sox or the Yankees or whatever it is you want to play for like that's that's the goal like that's the peak of baseball is playing for one of those teams for me the Red Sox and so I love this idea of like thinking about that dream I had and kind of angling it so it's applicable to storytellers where there really isn't like a really prominent like that's where the [ __ ] storytellers go like that's the place that's the stamp of approval that is the ultimate place if you're a Storyteller in some capacity if you are under the ball in studi umbrella boom you've made it like that's the equivalent I want us to be that I want to be the Boston Red Sox equivalent for storytellers and so I don't know how we're going to get there but I I want that level of prestige assigned to Ballin Studios relative to storytellers and then with that I want to own a [ __ ] piece of the Red Sox that's a great uh that's a great goal all right so give me give me something I can use today meaning you're a great Storyteller you're trying to build the team of the greatest storytellers tell me teach me something that will make me a better Storyteller today what's one thing you could teach me to make me a better better Storyteller um it's something that people love and hate that that tune into my content this is like it's kind of a polarizing thing but one of the things that I'll do when I'm telling a story like if it's not my own if it's somebody else's story which is like 99% of the stories I've done is I don't just resuscitate the facts of the story I and with a a very incredible team of people it's not just me anymore we will like inhabit that story it's I don't like I have scripts that sit next to me but like as my producer who's right over here will attest to I'm not reading the script it's a matter of producing a script that I can then like become a part of will begin espousing what people are thinking or what people could have been thinking or what could have been said in certain situations that I have no way of knowing but I am so committed to telling that story that I have learned it both outside as much as I can insid that when you're hearing it it would almost be like it was my story like the level of commitment if you're going to tell a story own the [ __ ] story like it enter the story and don't leave until it's done people that like tell you a story and it sounds like they're just telling something they heard that's not storytelling that's for regurgitating something you heard you want to be a [ __ ] Storyteller inhabit the story fou commitment to the point where you are literally acting out pieces of that story for your audience damn I'm hyped up S Sam you're the man Sam are you feeling what I'm feeling right now yeah John I once fell in love with this girl in Australia it's called love I fell in love with this girl in Australia and she was a dancer she wanted me to come out dancing with her I said no no no I'm not a dancer you're a dancer you do that I'll watch you over here on the side she said no get over here and um she was like okay okay hand on my hip and I put my hand on her hip and she goes let me stop you right there I was like oh man I already [ __ ] up this danc you haven't moved our feet yet and she goes if you ever touch someone touch them with intent and I feel like that's what you just told me if you're gon to tell a story tell the story with some intent you got to touch with intent I love that this woman sounds awesome she also told me she wanted to um never get married and have a man in every port and I was like I don't know if that's a figure of speech or this a lifestyle choice I don't know I don't really know what's going on but I think you're a little too um adventurous for me dude you guys are awesome uh your team's uh saying you got to wrap up and uh we appreciate y'all uh I've really admired you guys from afar come on yeah thank you for having us this is great all right that's the Pod we appreciate y'all [Music]

tell me about Bitcoin are you a fan of crypto if you put a gun to my head I would say it's going to end badly and why is that it's in the eye of the beholder there is no intrinsic value as I understand it to bitcoin you can argue that there isn't an intrinsic value to the dollar but it has the full faith and credit of the US government which is then backed by the hardworking American people I think for most people I would just say take a pass most people who have invested in Bitcoin couldn't really tell you what it's going to be worth and why it should be worth that

all right so Sean I wanted to have Isaac on because we talk a lot about making money on this podcast but I've been with Isaac at his home a bunch and I've got to know him and he's inspired me that to believe that like money isn't the only reason for business it's about like kind of craftsmanship it's about like creating like your little like corner of the universe and into your vision and I wanted to have him on the Pod because I think he's different than a lot of the guests that we've had on here but let me explain how I met Isaac I saw that he had this amazing uh website for his Airbnb and it said Isaac French owns this place he's a former accountant turn Real Estate Mogul but he's really most passionate about painting and being an artist and I was like this kid's the most interesting person I've ever read about uh what the hell and so I just called him and we became friends on the phone and then eventually met up in real life and he's kind of blown my mind as I've gotten to know [Music] him so when I met is I met him in a business context he had this Vibe where he was like oh like no the right way to do this business is doing this this and this when you say you met him in a business context what context did you meet him in so Sam can I tell a tiny story here about that yeah yeah so shout out Zach he's cool he introduced us um he introduced me to Sam at least I had no idea who Sam was but basically I started texting this guy named Sam and I was like I couldn't really give a rip I had just built live o which I'll get to in just a second and like here's this guy Sam who's some business mod go is what Zach told me and so I started texting him and he's like oh this is super cool you know whatever I told him all my numbers and then he was the next morning he was like Hey I'm about to make a post on Twitter you should join so I'll shout you out I was like I don't have Twitter I that's a total waste of time good luck basically and he's like no you should really make a post you should make an account and I was like no whatever so he made this post that kind of blew up it got like millions of views so halfway through that process I was like oh maybe I should go ahead and join this and the rest is history because like I actually and I'd love to talk about that but I absolutely Ely love the ability to connect with other people online and share what I'm all about but that was my introduction to Sam it was not as a fanboy was just like this random dude on the internet who started texting me about business and his number Sean they'll blow you away I'm ready to be blown away go ahead what is it can you can you what can you say the numbers yeah yeah so let me just tell you a quick story of Live Oak Lake if if that's all right because it's it's pretty cool so I was a bookkeeper and I had this dream I was 24 years old just gotten married I had this dream to create this like immersive cohesively designed Village of tiny homes in Texas I didn't really have terminology for it I just had it's it's really hard to articulate because I just had this vision for what it would feel like and I put an emphasis on feel because that's it was like a Vibe I wanted to create and people started laughing at me like you're crazy and I started looking for land for like three months one morning I wake up open up Zillow and there's this 5 acre like jungle down the road for me that I driven past probably 100 times but never thought anything of but it had this little cow pond in the middle so I was like hm I should check that out drove over and when I walked on the property I literally got goosebumps I was like this is the place to create to realize this dream met the realtor got it under contract I had $119,000 of savings to my name again 24 was not bankable by any standards um had experiencing construction so my dad was a plumber general contractor I grew up with that experience I've always been an artist so I've always design so so how how' you get it under contract what you if you didn't have any money what what' you pay to put it under contract I paid like $2,000 of earnest money but to close with cash in 30 days because it was a super competitive market this was 2021 in Texas people were flocking here and I knew this property I mean I was there within hours of when it was listed I knew it would have been gone by the end of that day so I was like I'm going to get under contract with a due diligence period and then I'll figure this out how much would you need at the end of that period to to have come up with $133,000 was the price of the property which was a really good deal too for five acres so just to make this clear you have $199,000 you put $2,000 down to to lock this up you now have I forgot how many said days you said 30 6090 days something like that 30 days where you're like I am I have faith that I will come up with another $130,000 that I've never seen before in the next 30 days of course why would I not well you got to have conviction you got to believe in yourself if you expect anybody else to believe in you and I did have a list of people that were like yeah these people people are I'm going to find somebody to make this dream work so I started calling people well my brothers and my dad who have this small G general contracting company which is where I grown up working they didn't have the cash either but they had access to a line of credit so my Hope was that I could get a hard money loan from them to buy the land to get the 20% of whatever the bank wouldn't loan me and then pay it back once I could refinance the property so I was already you know really banking a little overconfident really banking on my abilities to deliver this just crazy property that would appraised at really high values so I called them up and they're like no we don't want to give you a hard money loan we want equity in that because we like the idea and we'll loan you the money through our line of credit so great I gave them just handshake deal that day 40% equity and they were going to help me with the difference of whatever but then of course I was going to have to find a loan and you know go through all the rigor moral of that so we get under contract and literally I hit the ground running so uh the next day well the first three days um I spent on the on the phone with banks like hitting up every local bank I possibly could and then also walking the property all by myself with no phones or anything just sort of like letting the land speak to me about how to build this this little micro Resort and figuring out like how each cabin would be positioned and like being a little maniacal about the details of that because I'm a little little bit OCD as a perfectionist so um finally I got a bank that like they were like no no I mean liter you can imagine 24-year-old kid rolling their but I found a local bank who said we'll give you a loan because you know you have your Dad and brothers on board we want them to co- guarantee it but they were like 80% of the appraised value is what will loan you so great you know boxes checked then they send an appraiser out and the appraiser and I got to give it to them I didn't know what I was doing I drafted up this really primitive Pro fora I didn't know what a pro fora was just like this Apple Numbers spreadsheet thing that was like my guesstimate on how much the property was going to cost how much it was going to bring in sensitivity analysis for like occupancy and they probably laughed their heads off but anyway they gave that along with like some napkin sketches of what these cabins were going to look like my drone photos like marked up um of the site plan and the appraiser came back at like okay this is going to cost 1.8 million so the bank was like We'll loan you 80% of that so Bank was like we'll give you a million and a half uh loan if your Dad and brothers will co- guarantee this and my estimate was that the project was cost like 2 million so we had like a $500,000 shortfall which wasn't great long story short it actually cost us 2.3 million so here's the deal I the speck Home Market was booming in Texas at that time and so I was like all right we're going all in I got to make this work I bought another five acres down the road built a $750,000 spec home in four months and sold it and profited 200 Grand from that home was able to roll all of those profits directly into this project of course maxed out every credit card put in my 19,000 my Dad and brothers brought their line of credit we got the project done 9 and a half months start to finish which was absolutely wild as you can imagine too I mean this is postco supply chain issues are crazy I was designing it as we went it was the wildest year of my life on top of that I broke my pelvis like seven months into the project so we open in January of 2022 two weeks later my whole business as I knew it and did I woke up one morning opened the Airbnb app everything's grayed out were suspended on Airbnb worst feeling probably I've top 10 worst feelings I've ever had in my life and I called their customer support couldn't get a hold of anybody there was no warning there was no explanation so I felt like I was totally kicked in the gut and was like like all right we got to figure out direct bookings and so long story short found this travel influencer Who Lived like an hour away and I didn't even know what this was but just by digging I stumbled upon them they said pay us $950 we'll make a post a giveaway post about your property so I sent them photos two days later they made the post seven days later we had $40,000 of direct bookings through our website so I whipped up a a website overnight and 40,000 of direct bookings and 5,000 followers on Instagram from scratch so as you can imagine that was my sort of Eureka moment on Direct bookings and Instagram six days later we got restored on Airbnb so the timing was like perfect it was a glitch in their system but the direct bookings game was on fire so then that first year was a whirlwind 95% occupancy overall with these seven cabins which is just crazy starting from zero 80% of all the bookings were direct so here's the deal about direct bookings the otaa which is like online travel agency so Airbnb their fees are like roughly 15% so if you can capture the customer Direct you make 15% of margin you get the customers email so you can retarget them you can't ever be deplatformed and you're reaching a more aspirational guest because they're booking from Instagram not Airbnb so they're not Price shopping they see these immersive videos and like oh we got to come stay here we had guests come back three or four times in one year because we were able to retarget them and because the experience was just and wow you you sold this uh what four years in for how much two two and a half years in we sold for seven million so last October two and a half years in yeah all right guys so listen up we're doing something a little bit different here so we had this guy named Mr Ballin Mr Ballin is one of my favorite people on Earth if you have been on YouTube or Tik Tok you probably know who Mr Ballin is so he's has tens of millions of followers and he's built this massive business on it he's probably the best Storyteller I've ever heard in my life to be honest and he did this amazing podcast with us that we're going to release soon we're not releasing the episode right away but we we are going to give it to our true fans and if you are one of those true fans and you do want this interview we have a link below so check it out click the link in the description below and you can listen to it right away now back to the show so you let's just recap here you go by land land is you said what 130k or that was just the down payment that was the land that was the whole land okay the land you never did uh you never had built things like this you had done some construction some Plumbing projects but I assume you had never like had you ever built cabin before no and you built these yourself or you subcontracted out to a company I subcontracted but like I said I mean I was in there on ladders doing stuff myself that's how I broke my pelvis okay so you you buil seven cabins on top and the whole project buildout you thought was going to cost you two million bucks ended up costing you 2.3 but did you say you were selling you were the spec Market was booming you just sold a separate property just to help fund it you didn't sell you didn't pre-sell anything on this property correct Okay so you you do this it took you nine months to get live with the seven with all seven cabins is that right or one at a time all at the same time nine and a half months nine and a half months okay that's amazing and this is like you know post the postco and you start renting these out how much does a cabin rent for what was the average kind of nightly rate like 600 bucks a night yeah he said he was doing 1.1 million a year in Revenue so you do a million a year a million a year in Revenue 500k of profit and you sold this thing for 7 million bucks yeah so a million dollar a key two and a half years after starting construction on the whole thing and you sold it to who a small private Equity Group and that how did that come about they approach you you approach them what happens so we actually listed it My Philosophy is that every material thing should have a price tag this was super controversial a lot of people that saw the success were like you should never sell this this is lightning in a bottle but I was like no I've learned so much from this process that I could theoretically redo everything way better and plus if I ever want to raise money I want to be able to show like the full life cycle of a deal so we went ahead and listed it with a broker and we got approached by multiple private Equity groups they see the writing on the wall for commoditized short-term rentals and they want these one of one-of aind properties and um but most of them need to operate like at a much bigger scale this group was small enough that they were willing to take a one-off property so here's the crazy thing in the hotel industry you typically have three parties you've got the real estate you've got the managing company and you got the brand sometimes the operator and the brand are the same well with this property we built 150,000 followers on Instagram plus like 30 or 40,000 people on the email list so we essentially were selling the brand and the real estate together which is part of the reason we got such a crazy high price you know for a seven cabins in the woods in Texas but basically they came along offered seven 7 million we negotiated some of the terms because they wanted to sell or Finance some of it and uh the deal fell through like three times as could be expected they ended up having to get a bunch more debt than they thought but they came through eventually and we closed last October so yeah the look that you have Sean that's how I had when I first met him so when I first met him I was just on the phone with them and I go hey like I'm got to go to this conference in Idaho I think you said your parents or something like you have like connections there do you want to meet me up there and like do you want to become friends because when I met this kid I was like you're you're amazing and I said when I share you on Twitter you're going to get popular and just promise me that you're going to let me always invest in anything you ever do from now on because I think you're going to be a very popular person because his passion and the way that he's principled and like he like outlines what he's going to do I found to be intoxicating do you get that Vibe Sean you know what I mean yeah well I think the hustle that you showed there is great I mean that's like what successful entrepreneurship looks like right you start with a vision then you don't count yourself out I think that was the the next most important step you didn't count yourself out you could have said I don't have the money I don't have the experience I don't have the the time I don't have anybody who believes in me I don't have the network whatever you didn't say any of those things you said how do I get the time how do I get the money how do I get the network how do I get the cash what what do I need to do to get this right and you did it and I think you had a unique Insight which is that um a that people would want to stay in kind of a more unique experience and B once you realize once you turned your disadvantage into Advantage you turned your Airbnb disaster into oh wait I got to find another way to promote this and you found a better way to promote it right because let's say you had never done let's say airb had never knocked you off the platform and you had never realized that I should be using Instagram content through influencers or or through my own to do direct bookings what do you think this property would have been worth had that not happened maybe three or four million is my guess right maybe and that's and maybe not even be a sellable asset maybe not like definitely not a private Equity sellable asset but maybe just to another real estate owner who's looking for rental properties yeah totally I think the brand that moment with Instagram which felt like a with Airbnb originally which felt like a complete defeat like literally you can't imagine I mean I was 24 recently married had just spent two over $2 million do of other people's money had been a little bit laughed at by even some of my friends like why are you spending because that was even a lot of money when we built it uh a lot of my friends in Waco in the short-term rental market said you're crazy we already have this glut of short-term rentals here but my whole thing was we're building a new Lane of traffic we're creating a destination build it and they'll come but when that Airbnb debacle hit it ended up being the biggest blessing in disguise I could have ever engineered I got extremely lucky and just overall was obviously extremely blessed with the project but it's become my conviction that if you have an inspiring vision you have the ability to communicate it and you have the conviction to bring that Vision to life you become a magnet for everything you need and that applies to Capital to guest on and on the universe conspires for those with a mission there's a bunch of stories of people winning massively by having the idea of build that they will come but there's a whole lot more stories of people having that attitude who lose big and I like it doesn't matter what what business you're in this idea build it when they come build it and they'll come that kind of separates I think a Visionary from someone who's tapping in and building a great business I like people who point and say this is where we're going to go and a lot of times those people a lot of times those people fail more often than not they fail but I think it's dope when they do when they when they when they succeed you know what I mean and I find that to be different than how I look at life and I find it to be uh inspirational yeah okay that sense Isaac what you're going to say something on that well I was just going to say you know people now come to me asking all the time like how do we recreate that same success and what I really do believe I just said this but is that you have to have a vision and then you have to story telltell is the most valuable skill not just in marketing but in building something including building something like construction and here's why I've Got a Friend Devin so Devon is also 24 years old or now I'm 27 but I was 24 when I built Live Oak Lake and he was he was an engineer so he was a smart kid and he had this dream to create this shipping container home that was just super wild it was like five containers stacked on top of each other and he has an incredible amount of resilience and passion he went out and built the whole thing with his two hands like 95% of it he built with his two hands and he documented the whole process with an iPhone and a $20 tripod on Instagram and Tik Tok and he grew 1 5 million followers from scratch look it up it's called the Pacific Ben that's B it took him a year to build this thing and when he launched he had so many emails that when he opened up the calendar he he pre-sold the first year in like two weeks and now again he's become this magnet where people are like hey come build you know get they're trying to give him money and I understand a little bit about what that feels because people have done the same thing to me but again like he understood storytelling he did it very authentically and he had a vision and you just have to believe in it now it's a little bit more art than science in terms of like is the vision a good one I think some people have that and some people don't I credit my childhood some of the stuff I already described and the character that my parents put in me as like fully responsible for the success that I've had and let me just tell you like if you're a super confident person like I tend to be you're G to have some hard knocks I have fallen flat on my face more times than you want to hear including during and even after the sale of live oake so you have to learn humility and you got to learn it the hard way but that doesn't that's not mutually exclusive from having that kind of just intuition and sense that like I think it's a sense of taste too it's like this is going to work and here's why and even if I can't convince you I still believe in it and it's a conviction and then people rally around that and then of course your track record is a lot when you're starting from zero you don't have that but as you go you got to be very careful with the projects you take on because obviously you don't want to compromise that record so I think this idea of creating these unique spaces and places and having people fall in love with them online and then that turns into a business that makes you millions of dollars I think that is a awesome romantic Vision I know several people in my life that would like have the urge when they hear about these to be like could I do that could we do that where we live in this area whatever what are the opportunities you see so what do you think somebody out there um could go do and break that down like a blueprint like okay you're not talking not to me and Sam you're talking to this person who's listening who is inspired by this and says could I do that how would I do that what would you tell them what's the the two-minute blueprint you would give them yeah love it huge opportunity again airbnbs have been commoditized they're just you know unrecognizable from each other there's no differentiation so whether this is a an old summer camp that could be totally transformed into like this micro Resort or say it's a roadside Motel a lot of people are doing these or it's seven cabins around the lake I got a friend named Brian who had this idea to rethink what house boats meant and so he built at for $200,000 built this house boo you can look it up it's flow home that's f l hom I mean it's like totally different than what you think of it's like a mini yacht almost and then he started renting it out absolutely when berserk now he's raised a bunch of money he's buying marinas so the cool thing about houseboats is you don't fall typically into the same regulation as Str Str as short-term rentals because you're on the water so he gets to be in like these Prime locations in like you know Baltimore Harbor or Anapolis or Washington wherever and you get 360 degree Harbor views you're you're sometimes in hotel sometimes not even in any zoning at all and there's zero competition so again that's completely unique there's such a spectrum of what these could be I've got another friend who's doing tree houses so he bought a piece of property and here's here's the blueprint that I after number one choose red States over blue generally speaking because get speed to Market is everything and you want to be in in a place that's super easy to build so rural Texas which is where I am there's essentially like no zoning and I didn't have to go through some long permitting process like I would if I was on the Big Sur Coast or that's a radical example so find go off the beaten path it's okay to get away from places but you want to be within 2 hours from a major Metro area of like let's say a million plus people because that's your drive to distance it's like a station distance so you're going to get a lot of two three night stations you need to be within two hours from a major metro area you need to be within 15 to 20 minutes of like a town that has a a coffee shop maybe a good restaurant maybe there's ways around that like you could do a meal kit where you could partner with a local Chef or local farmers and like make that part of the experience that you're offering the guests but it's okay to get off the beaten path you want to find that 2-hour goldilock Zone then find land that's super cheap that has some natural potential um let's say trees are kind of a must because you can't grow a tree overnight and that's what Li O Lake had maybe it has some topography people love water perhaps you can create a water feature so I've got this other crazy story and I'm about to make a Twitter thread on this but some friends named kemell and Christine had a dream they're in rural Ohio they buy this piece of property with zero money that the guy is a pastor he had no money he bought this piece of property and then he noticed it had like this old dilapidated Lodge on it but he noticed like down below the lodge there's this little cliff and there's a seasonal stream that only flows like a few weeks out of the year and they had this idea so they actually dug out and Damned up this little pool and then they put in a pump recirculated the water so that it's flowing year round and there's essentially a waterfall swimming pool look it up it's called The Cliffs at Hawking Hills it's absolutely Wild this place has gone Mega viral they've got 600,000 followers on Instagram they're booking out every single night two years in advance and that water feature probably cost them 20 to $30,000 and has literally created millions of dollars of value both in the brand and in the property that they have so like find a property that's mediocre but that has the potential with your vision to create something totally oneof a kind and then architecturally make it beautiful infused unreasonable Hospitality into it so you don't need an on-site concierge you don't need um people holding your hand you know at every like festar luxury would be what you need is touch points that people care about so when I open Live Oak Lake I I quickly just had this idea people love to see their name handwritten so I perfected this process where we would handr write a card to each guest and then I partnered with a local bakery that was like five minutes down the road to Fresh bake our own recipe of chocolate chip cookies every single morning and then on the back end with my software because I pretty much automated the whole property so it was running with like two part-time employees the whole thing on its own I gave access to those Bakers and they could see every morning like how many reservations were that day they would make the cookies the cleaners who also had access to the property management software would pick them up would deliver them they would write the card so I didn't have to do any work for less than $10 some fresh baked cookies a handwritten card and a couple topa goes in the fridge made a massive impact and an emotional connection with the guest Not only was it a beautiful architectural and natural experience but they felt like me as the owner as Isaac like my story which we could go we could go down so many rabbit holes but like I wrote out our story in this booklet that we gave them like we turned what would have been a boring house manual into like this fun to read coffee table book but then on top of that there's this handwritten note and they all felt like oh Isaac just now left this for me this morning and so and then like in the messaging we did all these automated messages but we wrote them in such a way that was extremely careful and extremely intentional so it felt very fresh and spontaneous so little ways like this I love this Sam has this phrase and I've taken his copywriting course copy that two times now it's absolutely gold in my opinion but he has this little thing about these forgotten areas of copy so whether that's like the 404 landing page on a on a website or like the terms and conditions whatever you find these little places that are overlooked and then you just spice them up and you make them feel cared for and that's what we did with live O Lake and the guest absolutely loved it so there's a bunch there I could go on and on about this but basically here's the play anyone can do this anyone can go out and and spend $100,000 if you find the people buy this piece of land yeah you're gonna have to get a bank loan I know tons of people doing this I've got a community of about 50 people building these properties right now around the country and the value Creation in such a short amount of time if you execute this well is just off the charts dude you're like uh one of these toys that we just wound up we just kind of let go and just like holy [ __ ] sorry but I love it no don't apologize I love it I I whenever I get done hanging out with you I I feel more energy you I you know I think there's like two types of people there's people who are you feel like worn out when you get done hanging out with them and then you feel like there's people where you you feel inspired what are some ways that a smart person could get this wrong so not not every you know any blueprint if I say hey I've had all this success in e-commerce well I know a bunch of people who have failed in e-commerce and I can tell you where they go wrong you know some of the common traps that a smart person could fall into I mean I I I failed at it uh or at least I didn't Sam's like I'll take this one yeah I mean like I I bought one of the I bought uh a property wanted to turn into this and I actually didn't I broke even I mean I probably made a little bit of money but I didn't it wasn't like a screaming success so here's like a list uh the first thing is uh there is no such thing as set it and forget it passive income when it comes to real estate if you own the thing that that that ain't true it's still like a business that you have to run there is no said it and forget it would you agree with that Isaac 99% of the time unless you are just an extreme exception but yes the illusion of total automation is absolutely just that an illusion I think another thing is you really actually have to give a [ __ ] and care about it like in order to like make outsid returns you do really it needs to be really really different and special as opposed to just like in my case I was like oh there's not a lot in this part of the the country like this picture looks good I'll Stand Out done that's why my returns were only okay that that was not an exceptional plan yeah I think that design is the number one lever that you can pull as my friend Hans who's awesome by the way Hans lorite um absolutely blown up on Instagram recently he's got like 550,000 followers and he's like breaking down interior design in these little short form videos but design is the biggest lever you can pull in controlling how people feel and going back to that Vibe and that feeling that you're creating hospitality is all about emotional connections with people with your guests and you're in a business that's notoriously difficult to operate so you live or die based off of every single guest interaction and going back to raising all the money this is what I feel like a lot of startups inevitably fail at they try to scale too fast they invest all that money they see the opportunity they see the Live Oak Lake case study they invest all that money in like hiring these designers and hiring you know spending a ton on ads and doing all these things that are like the priorities are wrong you need a story so like if you want to do this you probably chances are like you shouldn't just dump a bunch of money into somebody else's well you can do that if it's the right person but ideally you need to be or you need to be partnered neck and- neck with someone who is extremely passionate and wants to tell that story but hospitality is all about like how do you serve these people and so this is where even though I I did automate most of the property like I'm telling you it was awesome we had zappier we had like six softwares we had Smart Home Technology the place was just running like a machine but I was still reading every single review I was still at least seeing every single message from every single guest and that's a 247 thing I mean that is that's intense any way you cut it and um when you don't have somebody who cares about that or you don't have the right employees that have even once you've built it who can operate it with that owner's mentality um you're just you're going to suffer and there's this great quote by Tim Ferris you've probably heard it but he says there's a glut of mediocrity in the world please don't contribute to it and I would say that applies to the design aspect that applies to the operations and like Hospitality aspect that applies across the board so if you come with the right mindset of I'm here to serve I'm here to like again build out this incredible Vision tell that story authentically chances are you're absolutely going to succeed because people gravitate towards that naturally you know Sean um you and I make money on the internet and when you make money on the internet that means the barrier to entry is really low so it's really easy to have an idea and turn it into something uh very quickly because of that I think I've gotten into a habit of creating things that were to use a funny pun subpar uh uh like there was very little passion involved in them or there's very little Excellence have you ever like felt like that when you're making stuff online Sean like where you're like looking back and you're like this is just not a very high quality thing even though it's making money honestly I disagree like I think the barrier to entry is low yes it's easy to play but it's not easy to win um and so anytime I've tried to do something that works online I don't know I threw my all into it uh I wasn't necessarily very good so even if I got a mediocre result it wasn't due to lack of effort it was due to lack of skill or or i' make something really good that nobody cared about nobody wanted it was just the wrong problem to solve um so I I think that yes it's easy to try something online I don't think it's easy to win at something online I don't think you can get away with something how do you define winning uh you know whatever hitting my goals for it right so having something that actually grows that is sticky that is you know very profitable you know the the things I look for when I do Project online is I'm trying to have it be successful I don't think any of these are easy they're definitely easier than going out into a plot of land and being like I'm going to build a luxury you know a luxury stay here and I'm going to serve customers essentially by hand uh it's definitely easier than that but I I wouldn't say it's like I don't think you can get away with sucking online and be successful because the barriers entry so low because the barrier entry is so low there's so many people playing because there's so many people playing to actually do something that's that works and captures people's finite attention is still hard we have so many friends that are popular on the internet and they make crappy stuff like well that's crappy by our standard it's not crappy by the customer standards right like I was thinking about this the other day so uh Jimmy Mr Beast who you know is is friendly with us and and is obviously super successful with YouTube he just released gu I guess I got leaked his uh production document did you guys see this I read the whole thing so I actually want to do like a whole bigger thing on it so I don't want to go too much into it but one amazing thing is you know you get to see inside of his mind and his mind works in a really unique way and I think you could see from that document why he's so successful but if you read the document or you hear the stories about him you would think that he is making the greatest videos the world has ever seen that he is the whatever I don't know who the famous directors and and artists of our time are but you would think he's doing that when in actuality it's it's sort of like saying who makes the best burgers is it McDonald's who has the most popular burgers they sell the most volume of burgers is it someone in the middle is it five guys because they they're pretty popular but maybe their taste is a bit better or is it the chef in um you know New York who makes this one Unbelievable Burger that's $36 and if you ever put a McDonald's burger next to that you could you would laugh at the McDonald's burger right which one is the best burger and Mr Beast has made his success because he has decided to be McDonald's on the internet right he is creating the videos that are mass Market that are going to get the most number of views even if they're not the most life-changing introspective emotional or beautifully told stories there are other people who do those and so I think there's just like it's hard to say what is what is the best right like the people the friends of ours who we think make just like pretty crap content that works it's because they're doing the McDonald's thing right they're giving people fast food content and then there's other people that are giving them artisanal content and you know who's to say what's better what's better than the other it depends on your goals can I tell you a crazy story about uh Twitter and going viral yeah what do you got so actually Sean I need to publicly thank you because your episode on how I write with David about how storytelling was I mean golden you don't know how many people I referred to that episode but like I don't know four or five months ago Alex liberman made a post about he was like I just watched this interview with Aon sorin about stories and I I'm entranced by it I want to go down that rabbit hole and so anyway when I saw that it resonated with something I was already feeling I wouldn't consider myself naturally a great Storyteller actually but I was like I feel like I can learn this skill and I'm gonna figure it out so I went down the rabbit hole and I listened to podcasts and I read books and I took courses and and copywriting and writing in general and then I was like okay I'm gonna figure this out and I'm gonna I'm gonna try it and so well first of all i' taken an eight-month break from Twitter so last fall I stopped posting at all and I I took an eight-month break but I would sort of describe it for various reasons but one was I was just recharging as a Creator you can't just constantly go you've got it you're like a battery you've got to recharge and but I came back kind of guns of Blazing in June with all of this like knowledge that I had been accumulating from all of these different sources and right out the gate I had like a six million view thread and people were like threads are dead and you know Twitter's de the algorithms trash whatever whatever and literally one after another and I'm knocking on wood but at the end of the day like I've never had so much sustained success like the last 10 threads I've written in a row without exception of gotten an average of like a million views a piece and then one of them went totally crazy so I wrote This Thread um about this train car that my dad it's penned to the top of my profile if you want to look at it but yeah I seen that one so I wrote This Thread I stayed up like all night I spent eight hours writing it I just finished copy that the second time and so like it was fresh on my mind and I I wrote thread and uh I didn't know you know I put 60% going off of your advice going off of a lot of people's advice like 60% of my effort of those eight hours were spent writing that hook like both writing it and also creating those images so it's got this great visual hook where you see like side by side train car before after and then like hours writing four or five sentences I know that sounds crazy but writing and rewriting it just trying to make it a science but I had this sentence in there let me read it so I said my dad bought this 120 year old train car for $2,000 it was a rotting CA infested wreck so I knew that I was probably being a little controversial when I said that I had no idea just how controversial this would be I said but after investing 147k in five months of work we redeemed it today it's one of the most profitable and exclusive STS in the country here's what happened so here's here is what happened there is like 30% of the population I've come to believe are these cat-loving I mean Karens and I I love guess what spoiler alert I love cats too I was not meaning disrespect to the cats when I said this but these people read that whole thread and then just absolutely murdered me in the comments what happened to the cats the cats were the landlords they should have kicked you out blah blah blah blah blah blah blah like machine gun fire I mean it was crazy and so on top of what was a pretty good hook and a good story we had just jet fuel poured on the fire by these cat lovers and me haters so that was um kind of crazy and I've learned didn't like Brian chesky comment on that or Brian chesy reposted it twice in one day Joe gabia reposted it Paul Graham repo quote tweeted it and then like you know 20 million views total in the first day but here here's another crazy thing so there's all these journalists that lurk on X you don't know about them because they probably have like 300 followers So within like two days I got invit for coverage so in in the two or three weeks since I wrote that post we've been now the story has been featured in the New York Post Vice uh Business Insider Fast Company The Daily Mail Cody Sanchez is coming to do a YouTube video like tens and tens of millions of views so you're just really creating like this surface area of for luck when when you post on Twitter because it's basically proof of concept they're like oh this story is resonating we should go ahead and post it too so it's crazy I love that story and yeah I checked out this this thread it's it's great but I think that the the real lesson here what's the right takeaway I think there's a few one is yeah there were some nice copyrighting techniques in here and yes it's cool that you decided like hey this is all a skill I can learn I can learn storytelling I can learn writing I can learn how to how to be better at content creation and you just decided to like obsess and devour that stuff but the real thing is the story went viral because of what you guys did you did something amazing you took this you know basically like beaten up rotten rotten train car and you turn it into something cool and it's like without that you could obsess over all the sentences you want that car that story is going nowhere and so the best content creation is go do amazing things in your life and then learn some best practices about how to talk about them is a much better approach than learn the amazing skill of writing Hooks and never do something amazing in your life and I hope that more people do the amazing thing in life instead of of the opposite but dude why are you on Twitter because you need to be doing this on Tik Tok uh you you're on the wrong platform my friend man it's it I want to start doing short form video but I love writing and Twitter helps me think better like number one I get to connect with much smarter people than those other platforms and it's not just about some vanity metric of having a big audience for me I genuinely enjoy the process of having to write concisely and again it was like a skill I just wanted to attack in copywriting and writing in general and so that process of like clarifying your thoughts by writing tweets and like every single word counts and building a slipp slippery slope that Sam talks about that people will fall down I just absolutely love that process and not just for production value of the story but for what it does in my own thinking but yeah the iteration will probably be I prove these these story Concepts and and sort of write a script in my Twitter thread and I've had like 10 of these that have like I said gone like pretty viral and then I basically have all my heavy lifting done for me and I just like throw together a nice green screen Maybe video of me talking about it and telling that story like really Snappy on instag on Instagram and Tik Tok and then eventually I want to do YouTube because of course as you guys know there's an insane loyalty and of course you can monetize and whatnot through that as well but I'm also a perfectionist and like the short form thing like people what really is working right now is really raw and authentic and that's cool but again I care so much about the production value that it's hard for me to sort of fit into that slot originally when I told Sean about you he was like oh sounds like an Amish guy who likes money and I was like yeah I guess that's a that's an interesting description um but if that is yeah I was like I'm the next two words were I'm in yeah um and if that and let's just say uh to someone who's not like entrenched in this Isaac your community is similarish to Amish uh what do they think about you like being this popular internet guy or do they even know do they even know like who you what you're doing yeah are you sinning by being on this podcast right now like what's going what's what's the reaction back at the farm all right we're going to go way back but I'll try to be brief here so my wife's grandparents actually founded this community 51 years ago and it started as an inner city mission in uh the slums of Manhattan and they had actually been atheists but had these radical life-changing experiences with God became Christians and then felt called to start this Mission there and it was super unlikely Beginnings but basically a mly crew of folks from all back grounds a lot of people that were sort of like disaffected with life sort of came together and a core group started coalescing and basically a church was founded but then a few years into it they they were like you know they were all young parents and they realized we need to have a culture where we can raise our kids that is going to sustain the values that we care about like family and our faith and whatnot so they started looking for land outside the city long story short they all moved about 200 people to Colorado West Colorado which was like the middle of nowhere for people that had spent their whole lives virtually in New York City and that's where my parents recently graduated high school Western soap of Colorado encountered this group of like weird people being called a cult by all the locals but again had these transformational experiences um came to God and join this group and then in Colorado they sort of learned all these skills like how to live off the land how to grow your own food how to work with your hands and you know relearn all these traditional skills like Woodworking and pottery and blacksmithing and then fast forward they picked up and moved to Texas in the early 90s and so we have a piece of property around 450 acres just outside of uh Waco where first the group was in Austin some was in Waco it Consolidated here and basically what makes us different is we take our faith very seriously and we want to make that Faith come alive in every aspect of life so instead of just like church being a program that you attend a few times a week we we truly try to live out community so we uh working playing doing doing life together and there's about 1,200 people a part of this Texas Branch about a third of those actually live on that piece of property that 400 acre piece of property the rest live on their own places nearby we're not common Pur we put a huge emphasis on like individual responsibility but basically we strive for Simplicity so well just explain it like this if I I live live in a what a you know a cookie cutter suburb of America so just like General m in California if I went and visited where you guys live what would seem most different to me what what is it that you guys do that would be most different yeah uh we don't have TVs in our homes we don't really have internet in our homes we again like 95% of the community either is self-employed or works for each other so we live this agrarian lifestyle we grow gardens we do use techn and this is where we're one of the ways we're different from Amish we just our whole philosophy is we want to control it versus being controlled by it and so basically I grew up on a farm taking care of animals I was homeschooled so we homeschool our kids I I have nine siblings there's a lot of big families not everybody has a big family but I I I went by the way Sean and I stayed in the community and I would joke with Isaac I'm like Isaac I'm an atheist don't try to convert me to any of this stuff but I would love to explore and learn about your community and when I went there they believe I'm going to kind of su Isaac they believe that in order to like show they're close to God and everything that they they're Craftsman in like everything they do so they have this like restaurant and like they make all of their own food there or they have a church where they built it you know and it's like beautiful it's a beautiful Church dude they had this Easter thing that I went to and there was these women singing I swear to God I'm like this sounds like a black choir in like in Harlem like this is the most like stylish like best singers I've ever heard of my life because they like studied it and they like perfect these things and so he had this Vibe where he was like oh like no the right way to do this business is doing this this and this so in order to learn Instagram I have to study it and then I'm G to execute uh perfectly no like I said we use technology we we use media too like we we haven't really used social media and I'm kind of one of the first that's pioneering that but we want to tell our story we just we don't want to substitute for the substance of the community that we've created so intentionally over decades by using like social media which innately is just a virtual world so we're trying to find ways to story because I feel like we just like I feel like Sam got you hooked on sugar and you hadn't had sugar you like yeah no I love vegetables and I just love all these earthy flavors and then Sam was like here have some sugar and now you've had sugar you've had the viral sugar the feeling of going viral and making millions of dollars and everybody loving your story and some people hating your story and then you want to respond to them you now tasted that how is that effed with your brain yeah it's like hey Isaac just just a little crack you just want a little crack just just a little you've had that social media crack what what's your honest feeling of of where you where you are right now with that man it's it's tough that's one of the reasons I took the eight-month break because personally I felt like it was becoming I love attention I'll just be honest about it and I I felt like it was becoming a distraction for what really is like a lived life and for one I have a family we have we have a a a little boy we have another on the way I have this amazing community life which I'm starting to be more public about I made a thread about the community a couple months ago and people are really intrigued with that but again like work life to use the term everybody's familiar with work life balance is is a very very real thing I just feel like if there's a way if there's an overarching guiding principle that work and life and family and play and everything can fit into they don't need to constantly feel like they're in conflict with each other but in order to make that happen I need people in my life that hold me accountable and like are going to be real with me and I've had plenty of that just to be honest like some of my friends that know me very well um have been like very honest with me and at times critical and I totally love them and respect them for that what' they say oh like you know the way you're the way you came across here was bragging or the way you said that um was maybe not completely what or not telling me it was more like asking questions because again like nobody tells you what to do here we're very very much like we we open ourselves up voluntarily but they're like you know is that consistent with you know the way that you would talk so and so and basically we want to be very careful that we and I want to be very careful that I don't put that the version of me that you see on the internet is exactly what you're going to get in person and and as you guys know there's just like that inevitable conflict but I feel like I've learned a ton through it and it's a constant struggle for me where I I probably need to delete the app from my phone and just use it on desktop I have a lot of friends that do that but Twitter is that thing for me I mean it's it's highly addicting it's just such a great format to connect with interesting people Sean I think that every man once he has children and becomes a family man I think they have two urges the first one is to be in some type of situation where they can exert force and be like uh use a little bit of violence to be a hero you know what I mean like a man robs a man robs a bank and you like suddenly stop it you're the hero that's one of them patrolling Main Street just in case something goes down and I might be needed yeah just like to be the tough guy that protects everyone once then the second thing is to like live in a farm with your family and your community and like everyone like lives like a little socialist hippie life and I've went to his uh I I hung out in his area and Isaac was like hey check this out I just planted a hundred apple trees and a bunch of like fruit trees in about three years these are going to be ready to bloom and I'm like oh nice that's kind have a lot of fruit like you're going to eat all that fruit he's like no it's for everyone I'm like well you're going to have to take care of this he's like no I just told everyone in the community that I planted these trees and we're probably going to make like a schedule but we'll we'll all chip in and like tend to the trees to make sure like it's going to Bear the most fruit and then we'll just like just spread it out evenly just being there for that 24 48 hours that one particular time I was like I'm fulfilling that need of like seeing this like hippie lifestyle you saw the David Beckham post Sam oh where he's growing uh he's like growing uh fruit now or growing got be friends with him yeah he went viral because he posted this video on his Instagram and it's him in a flannel shirt and the like old timey hat hat and the caption is Michel is doing well and it basically it's him on his farm he like now lives a farm life he's him on his farm he's gardening he's beekeeping and this is what he's doing and people it people just went nuts and about this about this trend Isaac I feel like you you've influenced him or maybe you should influence him I think he he might slide into your DM soon to learn a little bit do you not feel this urge Sean every once in a while we like I wish I would just out a farm with my family and friends and we all like did this together no dude to way too much work no I I don't have that Sean you gotta come visit at least I I have my versions of of these but they're like you know like for example I like writing and I'm like cool I just don't want to work I just want to like you know I don't I don't know how to paint I'm not skilled enough to paint I don't know how to build I'm not skilled enough to build I don't really want to go develop those but I'm like I want to write a movie or I want to spend my day um you know playing playing soccer with my kids or whatever it is things like that but I'm not as I don't have the same like Roman Empire urges that most guys have meaning like I don't care about history as much as get most of my friends do I don't care about living off the grid and like providing you know like pumping my own water and like irrigating something I don't want to irrigate nothing okay so like I don't have that urge uh for me personally I got I guess my own versions of them but they're a lot more mild well that sucks I guess uh okay dork let me go play house in the woods without you I I still want to have Wi-Fi like shoot me um this is like the man version of playing house and dress up like uh you know what I mean Isaac can we do rapid fire to end this so uh how old are you 27 what's one thing I can learn from you about Hospitality even though I'm not going to have my own you know mini hotels and all that but if I just have a guest coming over to my house I got an old friend from college coming over what's one Hospitality thing I can learn from you it's the single most valuable skill to have in life and you have to be selfish you have to want to serve other people so I don't think it's something that you can affect but if you I think everybody has that urge inside of them I think we're born to serve other people and uh read unreasonable Hospitality if you haven't already but basically look for those little ways like I described with the handwritten note that are surprising they're small but they Delight people and sometimes the smallest acts of kindness and generosity show the biggest hearts and so I don't think that uh I don't think it needs to be some grandiose thing I think you just have to want to serve them and people are going to feel it Isaac I think what you did with the the Live Oak Lake and what you're showing other people doing with floating homes and shipping containers and stuff like that is amazing it's an amazing Trend people should go follow you on Twitter to kind of like see more of these I think it is amazing because it is so hard and so for the few people who are capable of putting in the like you know the creativity the passion the care the hospitality that it takes to make these successful that's amazing and send me your links so that I can go stay at your places and for me it's a it's a reminder of like if if you want an unreasonable result you sort of have to do an unreasonable thing in C in certain areas and this is definitely one of those areas and so for me you know I would never be able to pull one of these off so Props to you because I hear your story and part of me is like oh I would love to do that but the bigger part of me who knows me better is like this is not for you you have to be exceptional to make this work you have to be exceptional on the real estate development side you have to be exceptional on the content marketing to go viral so that you can get booked you know for two years out you have to be exceptional on the hospitality because you have to re earn the business you know with every guest's day and I think it's I think you are exceptional you've done that and I think also it's a it's a good thing to know about yourself whether that's for you or if it's not for you and I think it's a very small subset of the population who who it's for them well I appreciate that can I close with two quotes that mean a lot to me one the way you do one thing is the way you do everything so sweat the details care put your heart into whatever you're going to do do it with hospitality do it with excellence and number two there's this quote by this English Pastor actually named John Wesley he was like a few hundred years ago but he said light yourself on fire with passion and people will come from miles to watch you burn and that's kind of my My Hope in life I want people to say well that's a life well lived and I want to say that at the end of my own life that is an amazing quote I love that quote dude thank you so much you're the ban um we appreciate you and we'll wrap up there that's the pod [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right everyone today's episode is Anne malum Anne started this company called solcore solcore is a pilat studio where she bootstrapped it in the first year she did something like a million and a half in Revenue it cost like $100,000 to start and she eventually sold this company near year nine for something like $350 million and she goes through this entire story but if you're listening I think the really amazing part is to copy some of her attributes because I get done listening to her and I'm like I need to step it up in terms of confidence or uh in terms of being passionate about something and in fact there's like in minute 30 I honestly teared up hearing some of her stories so check it out and by the way if you are interested in an I'm going to give a plug for MoneyWise this podcast I did with her where she went deep on her finances so how much money she spend how much money she made everything and because I liked her so much on that podcast I wanted her to come on here so check it out uh and I hope you guys enjoy this episode and let me know in the comments [Music] let's do a little background so I think you had a normal job but then started a nonprofit called back on my feet is that right Y and what was the original idea I don't know if you know much about how the homeless system works but many of the shelters in the major cities you can go live there for 30 days and then you get kicked out they give you 30 days to get your crack together um which is not very much time for someone who isn't going through homelessness to be honest to sort of start over go back in the city get back in the system 95% of the folks we worked with were dealing with addiction on on some level so you know Sam I know a little bit of your background and I think I mentioned on our last conversation my dad's um an addict and when you ask my dad mark what was your addiction and he'll kind of look at you and say everything because my dad doesn't understand moderation you know he had unfortunately instances with drugs and alcohol he went into impatient program before I was five so I don't really remember this but that seemed to do the trick he hasn't had a a drink or use drugs in 37 eight years um unfortunately gambling then surfaced for my dad when I was a teenager and he struggled with that and now my dad fishes he fishes every day for hours a day but you have to find someplace to put this thing and I had felt like if you can Master the drugs and alcohol you know and and try to get away from the bad behaviors have an addictive personality can actually be beneficial because when you get into something you know you are in it and you kind of obsess over it so running was this great alternative because there is no end you can always do more it's there for you you only need a pair of shoes it was a really great substitute for a lot of these guys who were still chasing the high I don't know if you know this but there's a correlation of people who work out who actually tend to drink more because you're chasing the dope you you're looking for these opportunities to get the elevated serotonin spikes um so that's why you know yeah working out can be a great a great option for people who are struggling with addiction yeah basically addictions I mean I don't know [ __ ] I just I know my situation but addictions don't go away uh they they just get transferred you know what I mean and so our thought was you know we can really help to change the emotional identity and get them to like themselves believe in themselves put them in a positive support network and turn them into somebody who is a runner an athlete responsible reliable and then we can go advocate for them at jobs that need employees who have those types of characteristics so Marriott became the largest employer of of back on my feet not because we were a charity Sam but because we actually had good candidates for them who were so appreciative to have a job in a respectable place where they got Ben benefits paid pretty well and opportunity for for growth by the way what do you do like your first day so you just quit your other job it's a Monday you just walk to the corner and like hey everyone um or I guess the night before like meet me here tomorrow at 5:30 like I don't know if you have running shoes or not but like make you know what I mean like what do you do like the first like five days yeah so I was a little more organized than than that I knew I needed the shelter to you know work with me and give me permission so I emailed the the I found the director of the shelter online I emailed him he didn't email me back took a little while for him to respond to me but I I kept like badgering him and you know he tries to think of the nicest way to tell me that like this isn't going to work these guys have bigger problems they're not like interested in running and I was very persuasive I'm like if you could please just meet me like I literally have ran by this shelter for two years I'm not a very religious person even though the shelter was religious but like I am being called to do this please meet with me and let let me explain to you why I feel so compelled so he did um and Sam the crazy thing was this that's such a great line by the way I'm being called to do this that's good yeah but it's it's true I mean yeah totally but it's also a good like it's like that's like a that's like a great argument right and so he met with me and this shelter again I didn't know anything about this shelter it was called the Sunday breakfast Rescue Mission but when people enter this shelter they the guy guys have rules and they are not supposed to have any contact with women zero they are there to you know no drugs obviously no alcohol they have a curfew every rules no women and this guy Mr McMillan like I owe a lot to him because he trusted me believed in me and was like okay I'm G to break our rules I'm GNA allow this woman to come in here and build relationships with these guys and he's like I'm not going to tell them an that there's some you know young woman who wants to come run with with them I'm going to let the the the particip or the members of the shelter at the time ask them if they are interested in joining a running club that's it and if they say yes I'll let you do it and you know I'm like waiting and waiting and a couple weeks go by and I finally get a response that says all right an here's the names nine Guys these guys want to run and I'm like awesome I need their shoe sizes so I go to a local running store I get the shoes donated again I'm I can be very convincing it's one of my superpowers I get them to give me all new shoes because I don't want that I don't want to show up there in my new shoes and then give these guys you know crappy old you shoes because they're homeless I just felt like that's GNA say I'm better than you and I didn't want them to feel that way so I got shoes shirts socks shorts um and I went up there and met them I got to meet them in the chapel for the first time I introduced myself and then I made them sign a contract and it just said if you're going to join the running club you got to show up three days a week Monday Wednesday Friday and you have to be on time you need to come with a positive attitude and you need to be willing to respect and support your teammates and everybody like sat up straighter in their chair they were waiting at least what it felt like for me they were waiting for someone to tell them they were capable of excellence and expecting I I didn't say to them you know what just show up if you can it must be tough living in here just you know do your best if you're please try not to be too late it was like these are the expectations and if you can't agree to them then don't join the club and if you can't agree to them once you do join you know you're G to get kicked off the team we have to adhere to principles so everybody showed up day one and um we all ran a mile like some of the guys cruised and got it done really quickly and then there was George who took a while like he was struggling um but we made a rule that day that nobody finished the run on their own so everybody went back to get George and we all like brought him into the Finish Line together and that like first day it was like okay like this is the group and all the media was there for day one like I wanted to get the word out everybody had to come and see this for themselves so the Philadelphia inquire The Daily News the local ABC NBC every I mean it was all of a sudden like this thing was everywhere all right guys so listen up we're doing something a little bit different here so we had this guy named Mr Ballin Mr Ballin is one of my favorite people on Earth if you have been on YouTube or Tik Tok you probably know who Mr Ballin is so he's has tens of millions of followers and he's built this massive business on it he's probably the best Storyteller I've ever heard in my life to be honest and he did this amazing podcast with us that we're going to release soon we're not releasing the episode right away but we are going to give it to our true fans and if you are one of those true fans and you do want this interview we have a link below so check it out click the link in the description below and you can listen to it right away now back to the show did people cover you because you're like uh a charismatic like you got I don't know if you had your hair like that but like you look like a celebrity when you have your hair like you know you're short blot hair and you look dope and you're charismatic were they covering you because you were charismatic and awesome or because this idea was so novel like how do you how how does someone who's not as cool get all this type of press well I I think I'll give you this this the straight answer and because this is you know probably no [ __ ] podcast the video and the media was like here this white blonde girl from North Dakota putting herself in the middle of these homeless shelters like running with all of these men like the camera the the story everything about it was like wait what they just kind of had to know the background and then you add in the fact that my dad is an addict and I'm so drawn to these guys and I could never help my dad and running helped me so now I feel like I can help people who remind me of my dad you know through this and yeah so I think it all just worked and then once they got to I mean the homelessness itself right people are like wait the people who are homeless are actually running that alone made people make make make their brains be like wait what and then add in you know the young white girl from North Dakota like what's the connection here so the media truly ate it up and it was coming from such a pure place for me of like I'm trying to heal myself from 10 years of nothing coming good from my dad's addictions and tearing apart at my family and now I get to use all that pain as fuel to help people and you know meeting some of the guys in our program I really think about those first nine guys because the majority of them were charismatic and lovely and like you just can't help but root for them so once the media started to talk to Mike and to George and to James and learn their stories and the fact that they're out there working hard I mean it's the ultimate Underdog Story and volunteers Ed showing up this group started to grow and it was like I'm like this is an opportunity you know Tony Robbins talks a lot about these windows that open I'm like this is my window and I had just taken a job at Comcast I was supposed to go work there in their government Affairs Department six-figure job like everything that my college degree graduate degree was setting me up for this Comcast opportunity was it and I remember going they asked me to go to a baseball game with a lot of like some senators and and people in the political sort of world were in town and Comcast was hosting them and I went that night and I was like I am so bored out of my mind there's no way that I can go take this job like all I want to be doing is hanging out with the back of my feet members all I thinking about is like this organization and how I grow it and vision and so I called them the day I was supposed to start and I I thanked them for the six weeks that they gave me from time off of my other nonprofit job before I was supposed to start and I was like I can't take this job like I have found what I'm supposed to do with my life and I'm really sorry it's I know it's the day before but like I I gotta follow my gut on this how old were you I was 26 26 26 yeah I mean again I'm asking all adults in my life I'm thinking of doing this like what do you think and everybody's like are you nuts like for your job like you're going to run with people in homeless shelters for your job and I'm like trying to explain the vision you know and nobody got it you know my mom thinks I'm like irresponsible she's wor you know like what are you thinking my dad's concerned for my safety all my mentor boss people are like an you don't even have any savings I had I had no money nothing what was the first Year's revenue or however you I'm sure I raised a million bucks in the first year I was a no [ __ ] really so you're a machine oh yeah and I would ask I mean I would ask anybody and everybody for money and I knew who to ask Sam I figured out that I had to find the executives who were runners in companies that could give and so I would only meet like Larry Solomon was my first I had a huge article on runnner world it was awesome you you bu but I'll also send you that Larry lived in Philly he was the COO of one of EX Center's vertical businesses emailed me amazing article you know rooting for you blah blah blah well I took one look at Larry's title and I was like yeah can we please have coffee i' you know love to tell you more right seriously Larry is still a very good friend today but he um we met and I was just like I need your help I want you to sit on the board Larry had just become a runner and I'm like you know I really want to build this thing and I want to make it big and blah blah blah so he came on board and Larry like Accenture right they had massive Marriott was a client Bimbo Bakeries AT&T they had so many tentacles and I'm just like I just need you to introduce me I will go in and close the deal but I need you to introduce me to the big players so that they can write the check and I don't waste weeks or months climbing the meeting with the marketing coordinator and then the marketing director and they just keep passing me up the chain like I'll never be able to raise money fast enough so um yeah and every meeting I went to I made a specific ask whether it was like I need $2,450 and here's why and I need you to pick me to three more people and then I also learn that I would that like letting me come and speak at your corporate event or something I was like oh that's I did that one time and I'm like oh this is really powerful like now I get the whole company you know excited about back on my feet because it was just so Innovative so what's your pitch to me let's say um let's say I'm an executive you know I'm I probably spend a few hundred grand a year uh giving it away to causes um I care about single moms I care about animals homeless guys I mean I guess that's like kind of important but like why should I like give [ __ ] about you well for one Sam I would ask if you you know are you a runner and hopefully you would say yes and I would say so so you understand that right so if you're an executive perfect so if you're an executive of this company you understand how important culture is and how important culture is for performance and making sure your people feel appreciated and valued here a lot of our members grew up in in households and environments and neighborhs where they didn't have that before and I can tell you being out there firsthand with all these guys they are some of the hardest working individuals I have ever met before but no one's given them a chance and if you don't have respect for people who are out there at 5:30 in the morning trying to put their life on the right track and doing the work and the effort no one's running their miles for them they are doing it on their own and it's a pretty compelling site to see and I can guarantee you if you give us a check not only will you know the money go to helping these individuals with life but we'll get your employees involved you know talk about a cause where you know employees can get actually involved on the ground floor running with us we do uh skill set training right where we teach these guys about financial literacy helping them train them for you know what their next opportunity could be but I can tell you from all the other companies we work with we have higher Employee Engagement with back on my feet than people have had in any other nonprofit that they've work you you make me emotion um because like on this podcast and in my life I care about making money you know I care about businesses and we're going to talk about solid core and and all the traditional success that you've had it just seems you know like I remember being in the hospital recently because I had like a kidney stone and I felt like I was dying and this like Nigerian nurse was like taking care of me and like in my head I'm like you you probably have seen five of me today and like you don't even that much money whatever but like you're making my life so much better right now like you have you're calming me down and like you are making this stay the best as opposed to the doctor who makes way more money but like he's just in and out and that's sort of kind of like how I feel when I talk about this nonprofit stuff which is making rich people richer is kind of insignificant compared to giving someone a shot or like doing something that actually matters and so did you get equal F fulfillment pursuing Sal core for the sake of like wealth creation versus what you were doing with back on my feet I had a lot of fun building solid core and I feel really good about how I've made my wealth over the last 10 years I mean I get to make people's lives happier healthier and help people be more confident and my team you know there are thousands of people who work at solicor who love their job who you know know we pay people really well I think we pay higher than any other Fitness uh organization um our coaches on a per class basis like there are coaches who make over 300 bucks a class because we've always done a revenue share model and I have just never believed Sam that it has to be a zero sum game like yeah should I have made the most money sure because I took all the risk put all the money in like I have no problem saying that some people can disagree with me that's fine but do I think that my employees should have made zero no which is why I put a a long-term incentive plan in place for them um a profit sharing plan when I sold the business and everybody got paid every full-time employee who had been with solar for a year got paid on that last transaction and they're going to get paid on the next transaction as well and I feel really good about that so I would say honestly like a similar fulfilling but like back in my feet made my life make sense so when I started to feel like it was time for my next thing yes I thought it and I thought it out of a few things one who who am I like my life is extraordinary I get to help people all the time um oh my God fear like what if I fail at my next thing whatever that is is all this going to be for nothing and people will just think I'm a one- hit wonder that definitely was something I had to work through and I didn't really know kind of how to top that thing you know all the attention that it was receiving receiving I was receiving all the accolades my ego was involved for sure but I couldn't sit there and tell back on my feet members in our mission to push and challenge themselves you know move moving things forward one step at a time growing if I wasn't willing to do the same so I was like listen I have an incredible Board of like 134 C Lev people there is an amazing budget the program the systems the processes the team everything had been set up like I really felt like I did my job as the founder and the first CEO of the of the organization so it it helped me to be able to move on to the next thing and then you you go on and you do solid core which if you don't know for the listener it's um a pilates studio that's just [ __ ] badass you scale that out and you get to you sell it eventually for like $300 million but you had this story and and you could and you could dive deep in the numbers and we went through a lot of the numbers on MoneyWise but you can go through some of the numbers but if I remember correctly your idea was basically like you were in La you you went to a pilat studio you do the math and you're like well they have like eight reformers here a reformer costs this much money I think I could do like a 100 Grand a month if I make this in DC or New York or wherever you made the first one is that is that story right yeah pretty close I def I discovered it in LA and then I was back in New York and and found another pilates studio that had the same machines as them and I was that then I started to do the math after I after I went for like 30 days and I was like I have never seen my body look like this and it's only been 30 days and I feel so good and I'm addicted to I was just bringing everybody I knew and then I did the math and I was like this is an incredible business and no one's really doing it on a big scale yet and what was the math well so there's 10 machines in there in this particular studio and the per class was like $30 a class and you couldn't buy membership you had to buy every time you went and so and how many how many people per class 10 10 oh sorry du and it was a full yeah 10 times uh yes say 10 it was full every time you couldn't get into these classes so there was 10 classes a day right okay so that's $300 a session times 10 so that's $3,000 uh a day and they're full all the time all or they were all the time like impossible to get into class and you're like $3,000 a day times 30 that's $90,000 that would be cool yeah totally and I was and and I also felt you know one of the things that I tell people a lot when I when I speak is like play a game you know you can win and so I knew after back on my feet I had to find another game I can win I was the perfect person to start back on my feet because of my story my experience in nonprofits my true authenticity for wanting to help these guys and I just had a knack for understanding system scalability and process and so with solid core I knew I needed something that was authentically authentically representative of who I was and I am the workout Queen I mean out of all my friends I've done so many marathons like Fitness and Wellness has always been a key if not the key priority so when I discovered this I'm like nobody knows you can work out like this we're all out there jumping pounding you know getting injured because it's a write a passage to be fit like this is so different and nobody knows about it and and I know I know how to build community I know how to scale I understand branding and I understand how to give a really good experience therefore this is a game I think I can win this is what I'm going to do next and how old were you for this one 31 30 31 32 3132 yeah and you had saved like I think you said like 150 Grand from 5 years 175 from like 5 years of of running the nonprofit and you put didn't you tell me you put all of it into a location and reformers like you like transferred the money you like transferred it from like an's checking account to solid core's checking account like all of it yeah and and that didn't that didn't feel so scary because I was 100% owner in the business so it was like the scary part was that that it wasn't moving the money it was that the Mone going to leave that account yeah yeah did it all leave oh I mean a high majority but the great news was as soon as I opened we started making money so you know I had I mean Sam like I was I I still am but especially back then out of necessity I was like a killer negotiator I had to get you to Roo for me you know so I'm talking to my general contractor you know and it's like listen can we do net 60 terms like if I can pay you sooner I will this is who I am I started this nonprofit this is what I'm doing now you know I have this money you know I can pay you but I'm trying to make sure I don't like get in front of my skis and so like I would negotiate you know that side of things and the first landlord made me give four months of security deposit which killed me I was like 30 grand that I have to give to you that like just gets to sit there and after that I refused to do security deposits and was very successful in making that happen but yeah and so as soon as like we opened and I started selling packages I'll never forget my first my first sale it was this woman named Amy who I still know she was pregnant and she was like I want to buy you know um private sessions and she went online and she bought $2500 worth of private sessions and I was like I can't believe this woman just gave me all that money she's never even done the workout she doesn't know anything and so um I trained her every day at 5:00 a.m. before the the studio like we started a class at 6: a.m. and then you know once we opened I got press I I leaned on my media contacts from back on my feet I got an article on the post yeah it was DC yeah and and so how and how much was the startup cost it was oh gosh you're make me math but I know the build out was like 150 Grand right I had to buy the M I had to pay a licensing fee of $25,000 just to open the studio that was just a licensing fee that's insane right that that's a that's an insane deal why can't I just buy a machine it's my machine let me do what I want that's why I that's why I ended that relationship in a couple years and went through a lawsuit but then I had to buy the machines which I financed because I couldn't afford to buy them out right didn't have all the cash I had have Finance them and I was paying a monthly you know a monthly fee to do that and then and that so those those machines were $6,000 at that time no $7,000 a piece that was 70 grand but I didn't have to pay that all up front um and then the rent was nine no sorry Seven Grand Seven Grand a month damn and what was your first month of sales oh I like we literally did over 100 Grand in the first first month that's insane it was nuts I mean but it but I was betting big and you know I think I told this story that but it's still good I have to tell it I was petrified you know those moments where you have that you're like all in and you're like oh my God what am I doing Larry Here Comes Larry again um from back on my feet and he's like and listen I'll give you 75 grand for 30% of the business if you don't want to use all your Capital like listen you grew this nonprofit I know you're going to be successful you know if you want to keep a little cash I'll do this deal and back then 75 grand when all I had was 175 was a lot of money and I you know I was beginning to think it was a responsible thing to do to take this money maybe I should do this deal and then I remember thinking I have the money and if I take his money all I'm going to say say is this is a massive doubt in myself I'm doubting myself and when things really get hard I am then going to lean into that 75k and convince myself like well at least I have that you know like you know I don't need to this is too hard at least I have my 75k and so I was like I can't I can't take that money it's just gonna it's GNA take my drive away it's G to take the hunger I need to feel like I'm being chased by a bear I need to figure this out and that's the way this is going to be successful so I just I mean every every hour I was passing out solid core pamphlets Flyers like anything I could do to get you to come take a class and then fortunately what happened was the same thing that happened to me when I took it everybody started telling their friends and Sam after your first class right you said you were so sore guess what everybody wants not in a bad way by the way but but everybody wants to tell everybody how oh my God I'm so sore I did this workout called siloc cor you've got to go they all want to tell each other how much they're working out so so it just snowballed did you create the routine that was part of the license so I got trained on what was called this method called the gree so we had someone come in and train me and then I trained my trainers on how to do that I'm not a personal trainer like that's not not my background and so we started again using their training program for us and then soon realized that like we actually want to make this more athletic these names that they're using were kind of silly it was it was like nothing intuitive um and then the machine started breaking and so I was like this relationship is doing nothing for me I don't know why I have to be associated with lree I want to like make my own machines that I need to be in charge of manufacturing like the workouts don't make sense I had hired somebody else to do the training who had a big background in MMA and and and you know she was certified and everything else and we started playing around with the workout she wrote a massive training program and then we separated from lree and uh he sued me like immediately which you won I think right or uh sorry you're not allowed to say well I mean it's far enough down but for all intense purposes he had to buy back his machines from me and we agreed to never to never talk again which we haven't so and and frankly after we did that all these other people who were part of then also started to make their own machines realizing like why are we paying a massive premium on machines this isn't a franchise so we're not getting the benefit of a national Grant here like it just didn't make any business Financial sense so yeah and then making my own machines like that was a huge gamble um I didn't know how to do that obviously and like tooling engineering manufacturing prototypes I probably spent lost a couple 100 Grand just because I didn't know what I was doing made me probably even more than that but like we got a machine it wasn't right I already like it like it didn't work properly like we had to redo it it was a mess what was your first Year's Revenue the first year Revenue I think you asked me this last time and I had I think you said a million dollars right well the first it was more than that because that was the first studi revenue and then in the first year you know I had five of these open so you had I didn't know you had five at at the end of the first year yeah that's insane right yeah but same thing I'm like momentum momentum momentum you ever heard the funny story about Subway and I don't know if it's true or not but like I just love it so I keep telling it but Subway had one location and they were like off the beaten path and they weren't doing that great so they thought you know we need to open a second one because people will think if we have two that we're killing it and I like remember hearing that story I'm like that's so brilliant and even though we were killing it I was like I need to maximize on this and get two two and three and four open so that people start being like I'm seeing this thing everywhere I must be missing out they must be doing so well this thing must work um and that really like served us really well so we just kept reinvesting the profits into the next Studio I kept negotiating you know as long like longer terms to pay back if I needed to um and I just stopped doing security deposits with with landlords how old was the business when you sold each different chunk because you sold it a couple times right yeah so I did a minority deal in 2017 so the business was four years old at that point and we had 27 locations on an annualized basis each one of those Studios was doing about 700 Grand okay so 27 time 700 that's uh uh roughly $19 million in Revenue yeah you sold the business for what valuation or you sold a chunk for what valuation I did a pretty big valuation back then so the valuation was like close to 60 million wow um yeah and people people the the firm's definitely blocked at that and I just said listen it's not so much about the number it's about the terms and I know how much money I need to get to 100 Studios and that's $12 million because I'm going to continue to use the profits and I also want to take secondary off of the table and and obviously no one liked that especially that early and I was like listen these are those are the terms like don't don't get so freaked out about the terms tell me what you need in order to do this deal and so there was a a healthy pref on the the minority deal that I agreed to and I had no problem doing that and I remember too people were like you know an well how do we know you're not going to walk away for six million and I'm like I would like I would just sell the whole business if that was the case like you think I'm in this for $6 million like which is such a good way to like approach you are good I'm really bad at negotiating um like all my staff knows that like don't to Sam about salary discussions because my default is like I just say I just say you got to talk to this other person about that because I just say yes to I just say yes to everything so I've like removed myself from negotiation because I'm too nice and like well how do you think I got on this podcast I know like I well I don't that that would sound like a backand compliment it's not but uh I I'm just I'm soft as [ __ ] like I just I just I'm like yeah I'll do whatever you want I'll do but to approach like a NE negotiation of like well don't say no just tell me what you need to win and I'll see if I can actually make that happen for you but then in order for you to win it has to take into account here's what I need exactly and so I I did that with landlords and you know and private Equity it's like you know landlord would always block like we we always do security deposits I'm like that's not really a response right like what are you trying to protect against right you have a corporate guarantee you have X like help me understand this and I can try to solve the problem a different way so I I solved the private Equity problem with the preferred return you know it's like your downside is I'm not going to see another dime until you make you know the 2.5x your money that's just such a funny response we always well why do I have to give a deposit because we've always do deposits well that that's sound that's not a good reply give me a different reply that's the best that is the best and it it really it really does work because you make them articulate what's important to them and usually what's important to landlords is you The Ledger the balance sheet of the total you know term of the deal and um you know so that's why we were able to push rent a little bit further down the road and like increase the rent in year five or six and you know okay you're protected on the corporate guarantee you know front so like you know you have three years I'm not going to do a security deposit and let me tell you why that's important for me and why it benefits you because the more I get open the bigger the brand is you know it's going to get more brand equity and and you know this location will do better better so yeah I think people all people can do a better job of of negotiating and it's one of the really amazing skill sets to to learn Chris Boss never split the difference I love that book I read that book during covid because I really had to get good at negotiation and what's the what's like the the the summary of that well he just goes through these different strategies right about like mirroring and he gives this ex one of my favorite examples was he gives this of a car he goes in he's like listen I have call it $10,300 you know that's the car that I want and just say it was like 15 grand or something and the guy comes back it's like okay great news I got it down to 14 he's like wow thank you so much I really appreciate you advocating for me but the number of the amount of money I have right now hasn't hasn't changed I still have $10,300 if you can do the deal for that you know I'm I'm here goes back comes down more gets to like call it 113 and at that point he knows right because he hasn't moved he knows not walking away you are you're so close the guy's going to do the deal and I remember using that strategy a lot as well in negotiating you get people to come and come come and now they're just too close that they're not going to move away so the whole point is like not meeting in the middle wait so is the point is then do you go to 11,000 or do you stick at 105 he's stuck he's stuck because that guy is so close now he's not going to walk away when it's like eight you know you used to be five grand away now you're just 800 Grand or sorry $800 away so he like and up getting you know the deal done and he just goes through different strategies in there on how you can mirror you know this is what I hear you saying yes you know and like don't walk away when you hear a no like a no doesn't have to be a bad thing so me and my lawyer um who I had on staff at that point Who's just a jack of all trades and unbelievable you know we read that book Sam because during covid we knew it's like what's going to kill us what's going to kill this company is not that we don't have Revenue coming in right now it's if these landlords sue us and make us pay rent and no one really understood who was right or wrong then you know it's like well this is a force majure it's like well we don't have any money coming in how do you expect this to pay rent so we just said we just have to get the landlords on our side we have to figure out a way to restructure the deal that doesn't allow us to pay rent when we are closed and we also can't kick the can down the road you know so we came up with strategies like how about we lengthen the term of the lease We'll add another year or two to the back end of the lease you know so that you have a longer tenant like if you force us to pay rent you're not going to get another dime from us you know because we're going to go bankrupt but if you work with us or maybe we increase the rent you know year eight nine and 10 to make up some of the difference for this but we know that we couldn't in a year from now have this like okay you owe rent for those three months and give us a check for 90k we had 75 Studios like there was just no way we were going to recover from that so anyway um those kinds of things you know people talk about how Co killed so many gyms and a lot of that was not just because of covid it was because of these operational and financial decisions that weren't like made as smartly as maybe um some other companies could have made and not understanding what was going to be the demise of them when you when you completely got out it was like what $300 million valuation yeah a little little more than that but yeah um and that was last a last April I got I sold all my shares how old was the business then no n and a half years that's a great run and when you look at like what made you guys great was it operational excellence was it because your brand was cool was it because the workout was uh better than any anywhere else like what's like the honest assessment of like these were the one or two factors that set us apart from Barry's Boot Camp or whoever else is you consider to be competition or all the mom and pops out there yeah the workout is incredible and and I'm glad you've gone to it because you can understand a little bit what I'm saying it's just like unlike anything that was ever out there and now there's a lot more Pilates out there but we had speed to Market we are the dominant player you know in the space and uh we have a pretty cool full brand so I think the Aesthetics we know what our brand is right the whole tagline is create the strongest version of yourself and I think the company is still doing a really good job of Leaning into that one of my favorite campaigns we did was it's not for everyone and we really went in and like this isn't this may not be for you but for somebody you know it's almost like a Nike commercial it's like if you like to push yourself those are great commercials yeah yeah and the N you're talking about the Nike Olympic ones yes exactly yeah winning winnings winning not for everyone so we did we did this campaign a few years ago and it really like people people watch that and it's like I want that to be for me I'm tough I'm strong I like to push myself I want to grow I can handle tough things and so I think there's this Aura of if you know somebody who does solid core you're like I know who you are like I I know exactly the type of person you are you're driven you're ambitious you like to work hard you're not afraid of the work you're not the the work is actually the joy for you you want to feel good at the end of the day knowing you put your all and tried your best at like everything you did so I think the brand ethos is definitely a big part of our success and don't get me wrong again operationally I'm a pretty good operator are you like pretty good where you're like you're actually the best like you're to or are you like that's like I'm pretty good at it but it's maybe not the best the thing that I'm best at yeah I'm great at putting systems processes in place but like I'm not the right person to run solid core today if that makes sense like it's too big it's too monolithic it's like I just I move quickly and that's not actually what you need you need somebody like Brian who's much more methodical analytical patient I think that for most entrepreneurs who are like new I think that brand and some of these exercises aren't terribly important but I think that if you have a proven track record where you're like um this person executes well and they execute when you have that tracker track record which I think I do like for all my businesses now I I spend a lot of time on branding um where I'm like what is this how does this make someone feel like the colors the name things like that and that like I like I said that's I don't think that's important for most people when they're just starting out because it's like you just got to get started and get some traction with you guys you kind of it seems like you came out the gate with good branding and you're kind of in that that boat by the way where like this is your second company and you like it's like no you execute so it's okay to like kind of sweat this stuff or think this stuff through who inspired you for your branding and where what was the exercise that you went through yeah we're we're similar there I'm I love The Branding and marketing as as well so I I did that for back on my feet and and and solid core in the beginning um you know like with back on my feet it just that the name itself I I remember someone telling me like oh you should call this thing the homeless Runners Association of America and I was like that alone will make the thing fail because it doesn't sound cool it doesn't you know what I mean it sounds like one of these every other organization that just like H you know and I wanted us to be cool and coming up with the name for solid core it was just like re iterating a bunch of names I'm like oh that just has it that just makes you sound badass like you know when people like oh that's solid like obviously like the core piece has you know lots of double meetings and whatever and then the brackets I thought could indicate like your obliques and the tightness and community and together and so I was like this is it it just it just kind of looks cool and they you know we haven't done a a redo of the logo or anything like it just kind of stuck around and the brackets I mean I have I don't know if you can see but I have like a bracket now I lift it up my shirt for YouTube I have a bracket I have a bracket tattoo um again I just I just always feel like things need to be cool for people to to want to to want to be a part of them and so I didn't want to spend a ton of like stupid money on branding and marketing for another idea that probably would have worked also but one of my mantras is that there's more than one right answer and this was like a right enough answer to move I want to ask you about some ideas but you um you kind of caught the uh Pilates thing like at the right that one well um what Fitness related businesses excite you right now you when you were talking about uh a few you're talking about something when and I started thinking of Hydra it's called hydrix have you seen hydrix H yd r x Hydro I think it's called H Ro yeah is it h Rock sorry like the competition yes the competition in New York I like I went and saw it it is awesome it is awesome like I saw that and I'm like oh this is like going to be a this is I it's already a thing but it's like this is like really going to be a thing are there any things that you see where you're like this is this is like uh going to pop well this I will talk about bque fness in a second but one of the things that my husband and I a bunch of friends just did is 2929 have you heard of this event yes uh the founders in Hampton did you talk to them Mark yeah I did talk to Mar yes so I'm gonna go to uh they're they're releasing the schedule soon I'm going to one of them you got to go I I we just did it so the 29029 is the elev ation of Everest so they created this event where they partner with ski Mountains for the most part around the country and you have to climb whatever the number of times up that mountain that's St Foodland of Everest so we were in Mount TR blant which is in Canada and our Mountain was about 2200 elevation so we had to climb this thing 15 times 1.7 Mile and it was it was Steep and I'm like a marathon or I've done these things I really was like I'm just walking you know up up a hill like I'll be fine completely different than anything I've ever done before for the pure duration like if you think it takes you 60 to 90 minutes to get up these things you know you're out there for 15 to 20 hours some people longer like some people literally had to be on their feet for 30 hours to get the 15 hikes in for the time that you're allotted because you have 36 hours it is unbelievably inspiring the people that are there because most people are there because they're going through a divorce they're fighting some Health Battle they've lost 100 pounds they've got something you know bigger going in in their life and they need to show themselves that they can climb the effing Mountain physically so that they can go back and do it you know emotionally mentally spiritually whatever and it's just awesome like it's awesome yeah and his business is wild basically I think they sell out like most all their events now uh I think it's like $5,000 to go and they provide the accommodations and it's not you're not sluming it it's like really nice stuff um and so you think that's like going to take off I think things like that like I think there's going to be H rocks love it Innovation there was a cross CrossFit Games I think you're going to start to see more events you know remember when like Ragnar and some of the um you know Ragnar relay no what's that oh my gosh so Ragnar used to have it's like how do spell r a g n a r it might still be going on I just don't know anybody does it anymore but it was these relays where you you had two Vans and you had like 24 hours to run 100 some miles and like you're you're you're literally driving through the night like your Vans are moving on there's stations are it was just again so cool I don't really know if it's still going on but it is it is and and the company that owns it I think they own like a bunch of different events now yeah um so I think that BEC I I really think that there's this continued movement I mean I know you don't drink I really don't drink a lot of my friends don't want to be partying like everybody is looking at least in my group for like physical fun activities to be doing with their time and I think these sort of endurance challenge events of All Sorts are going to continue to grow and and pop up all over the place because that's how I think a lot of people want to spend their times and I'll tell you I didn't have my phone with me for the entire time I hiked I refused to bring it with a and I just am craving being out in nature challenging myself physically and I think a lot of other people are too so you're going to see more of that um I think a lot and then from the boutique by the way Mark told me he was like I was like what makes you guys special and he was like well um he gave a big breakdown but he was like one of the things is that we make it so like most of the people are going to fail like we want it to be hard enough to where if you get done with it it's a big deal to you and you're going to want to talk about it he's like most events they actually make it where too many people succeed uh and so he was like talking about how like the mindset behind making that event but you know what they do really well so the asense they they list different mountains so you actually don't feel like you're failing so even though you may have not made it to Everest like if you climbed 10 of those you made it to kilamanjaro so they give you a metal a kilamanjaro metal instead of like did you get to all of it you did all of it yeah did you almost quit at all or were you like no I'm getting this no matter what well Mark will tell Mark will tell you so I I going me sleep the night before and I actually had like a mini meltdown and I'm like I'm I I don't do well with sleep deprivation I'm not going to be able to do this and so I was on three hours of sleep and my strategy was I'm just going to do as many as I can as fast as I can before I hit a wall so I was on Pace to probably finishin the top five and I my 11th lap it just you know like if you ever done an endurance event and like the wall it just happens and it happened and I made it up the mountain halfway in the time that it was taking me to reach the whole thing and I just sit in the med tent for 45 minutes I'm asking them I'm like I can't I can't keep going I need to go down to the mountain there does my half of lap count so I can come back tomorrow and they're like No And I was like I'm like what like and now I really can't go down and I just couldn't get myself together and Along Comes Mark and he gives me Coke like not that kind of coke he gives me Coca-Cola COA yeah and he like yeah he's like you're G to do this I'm going to walk up the second half of the mountain with you you know you're not going to go back down I can see it in your eyes you you know like you're not somebody who needs to go back down so like yeah I took that shot of Coca-Cola and like got up and we made it up the second half of the mountain and then I went down and went to bed and finished my next four in the morning but yeah Mark like came along and saved me you had this um you put in the notes you said um the number one reason we had to let people go was because they lacked proper judgment critical thinking skills you said what I discovered was that the best critical thinkers are great at taboo because you have to think on your feet and be strategic when you describe the word you want to get people to say what's taboo I don't even know what that is yeah so taboo is a game where you like have teams and you get a card and at top of the card says a word say let's say it says you know book and you have to get your team to say that word but underneath that word book is five words that you can't say to get them to say it so it might say like page or reading or things like that so you have to think creatively and I have to know who's on my team you know so like how would how would get Sam to say this you know say this word and like there are people who Crush that game and from my experience whenever we've played on a retreat or something the people who get stuck or flustered or can't think on their feet whatever usually don't work there very much longer and I'm like there has to be a correlation between this game the ability to figure figure it out of like who's on your team how do you make this happen thinking on their feet and some of the smartest people that I think are my friend group are also excellent at that game so there's something there you also said something like um you're like well uh AI is taking over Fitness and uh you can personalize data supplements exercise food based on individuals so for example if you're a 44y woman a 44 year old woman who wants to gain 10 pounds of muscle we know your blood work we know this about you we know that about you here's the program that you're going to be using or you should be using is there anyone in the space who you like who's taking advantage of that Insight yeah so I'm um I'm an advisor um and an investor so I will disclose that to a company called oxfit and they are an atome um it's sort of like tonal but I think it's much more comprehensive and better and they're AI game is really progressing to do just that it knows when you're tired it knows certain things you know how you're lifting the weight you're imbalance whatever and they are really investing in the AI so that they can partner and you can add your blood work in and you can add every sort of data point that you have about yourself and then what your goals are and it will Design again like exactly what you need to be doing and I think we're really I think that's going to start to take off in a lot of different areas but listen you know there's a lot of people who are still just like checking the box and I think that's why they get frustrated because they're not doing the right things for the results that they want and it's a little bit of a guessing game you know not knowing your metabolism not knowing your deficiencies not knowing you know again your age or your hormones and how all these things are affecting the workouts that you do so I think that's just going to continue to to within five years I think it'll be kind of foolish to just be like guessing on what you should be doing to work out I've had a um a handful of friends um get diagnosed with cancer recently and one of my friends detected it because he did one of these like pren noo or something like that one of those like uh scans that you just pay money for and i' like in 50 years or some amount of decades we're going to look back and we're going to think it's insane that you had cancer growing inside of your body and it could have been okay had you just been told that it was there and it's like you've got this like foreign thing in your body uh that that you don't know about it and that's kind of a that we accept that that's normal now but I think that in sometime in the future we're not we're going to be unwilling to accept that and so I'm person personally really interested in that I am also per uh personally quite interested in like figuring out exactly the fitness or diet that works for me I can't uh based off a blood work I don't think I've seen a product out there that's doing it that's nailing that though yet um I think a lot of it's like pseudo science I just I think it's it's none of it's like awesome at the moment do you know what I mean yeah I agree and and I think I it it will get there because if people can figure that if they if people can figure that out and again imagine if you've been so cred your entire life to not see the results when you're willing to do the work when you're willing to put in the effort and like it's still not happening I just think it's only a matter of time with where we are with yeah the the AI stuff and uh the demand for it frankly are you gonna start another company no sir not right now not right now I'm I know too much I know too much like the beauty of starting companies is I think a lot of times is naive and I'll also be truly honest that like some and then the the financial motivation is a little bit gone of course you know I really felt with back of my feet and solid core that I'm like doing a c one I was very into them both but two it was like I'm GNA make people's lives better I felt like I'm the perfect person to do that so I haven't had I'm not and I'm also not looking for it right now but if I have that experience again where I come across something or I'm moved or I'm like I have to do this like that is when I will that is when I will do it but for for now I just feel like I'm giving my spous myself some Freedom some time to to feel this new chapter are you like seeking anything or you're just like like because that's like an interesting mindset uh that that I've been in before and I don't know if I approached it the best way but it's like the mindset um uh I'm just going to go out and live and I'm going to be my ears are open in if I get called yes I'm just going to live right now and yeah I think even if I got called right now Sam I would I wouldn't I don't know if I could if I could do it like because you're Tire are you're happy exactly it's not tired I'm actually very energized but you've read the book die was Zero yeah I think we talked about that right so I'm just you know I want to be playing like I'm trying to stay in my feminine because I've been in my masculine a lot in my life and like I want to have room and prioritizing playing and for me that is is beach volleyball it's any kind of sports it's connecting with friends and family and being able to be a little bit carefree and I don't want to put so much rigid structure back in my schedule um I just feel like I need a breather from that and I and I'm not willing I'm not willing to do it all right so we were about to wrap up and an was like you got to talk about this idea all right what's this idea I read it but I need you to explain it better so you got this idea tell me about jumpy yeah so I umum so you've all been at the airport right and like your flight gets canceled or delayed and you're desperate to get home and you of course like you go up to the Airlines and they can't do anything because they're not going to kick anybody else off of the flight they don't care about your status and whatever and so the idea for jump seat is very much like Ticket Master or something else where there's a platform where let's just say Sam again your flight got canceled and you're like damn it I have to get home you go on jump seat and you offer you $1,000 for any seat on any flight going back to where do you live uh let's say I'm going back to New York okay so you're going back to New York and like you put the offer out there and all someone has to do is accept your offer you trade seats they now are on your flight whenever that flight gets rescheduled but they don't have the same timeline that you do to get home so it's like no problem and it can work in Reverse where if I'm at the airport and I'm like you know I have a flight back to Miami but like I'm in no rush I'm going to put my seat up for sale and if someone else wants to get home sooner they can buy seat Well it's like seat geek for play tickets where it's like uh someone owns them but if you own it you can auction off your totally you can auction it off but think about think about how much happier customers would be and the airlines where you could build in the airline to take a little bit of the cut so now I'm a happier Delta Customer because I solved my own problem even though Delta couldn't solve it but they're allowing this platform and you can even do it for seats so let's just say I'm on a flight and I'm sitting in 32A and I'm like I really want to fly first class this person has first class they don't really care they put up their seat for like 500 bucks and they'll come back and take my economy seat and now I get to sit in first bus would you ever pursue this no because I don't think this is a game I can win I'm not like a tech person or something that's why I want like I I want this product so I can use it so that's why I want somebody who's like oh my God this makes so much sense and you fell in love with the name jump seat that's a good name yeah it's a great name and I have a logo and everything like someone do you really it's so good I'll send it to Ari you can see it how can how could someone wait would you actually work with someone if they wanted to if someone wanted to how would do you want to give away how could someone contact you like can they just DM you on Instagram yeah yeah if you can if you can't figure out how to find me you're not the right person to to so yeah uh how much you think well whoever owns jump seat.com they're they're just sitting on it they're not using it you own jump.com yeah of course I own it how much did you pay for this like $5 or something not much jump seat.com was $5 I bought it years ago I've literally had I've had this idea for such a long time and I'm like just make the logo you know like I had my friend make the logo and it's it's really good um it's it's the name is so perfect it's like what I can just trade seats and and people are like oh my God airlines are never going to allow that and I'm like they already allow Aggregates like Expedia and you know they're already in their backend system and this solves a problem for them and they can make more money by just taking five dollars off of every time someone switch sheets why would you know why would they care this so funny I thought this was a Half Bake thing so you're you're in I mean I would love for someone to do it I'll give you the wait I won't give it for you you can you can give me a little bit of equity in the company and you can you can run with it but you're gonna have to convince me why you're the right person to to do it what would they have to say to convince you well I'd have to know again why it's a game they can win what's background do they have the tech do they have any you know Connections in the airline industry have they ever built anything like this before you know why would this be interesting to them um do they know how to scale and and build something like do they have the tech experience which I don't have at all God that's so funny I like went to jump se.com and I'm like oh hey it's registered but no one's using it uh I did not realize you're this you're this far down all right so they're gonna well here's what I want to know you're going to have to message me and I'll have to do a um I'll do a shout out like if there ever are results but you have to let me know how many people message you and if anyone's actually promising okay I will I said it last time it felt like I was like uh like being not genuine because I was so happy but you're um you inspir the [ __ ] out of me and uh you're one of my favorite people on earth I I have found myself um since we last talk like approaching a situation I'm being like what would Ann think about this um and so I just want to thank you for being part of my life and um doing these podcasts you're the best you mean a lot to me that's really sweet we'll get you a t-shirt Sam that says what would Ann do just kidding that would be great that would be great as long it's a crop top exactly yeah as long as it's a crop top then it's good and it must be at least two sizes too small uh uh I appreciate you thank you very much um that's the pod [Music]

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right today is everybody's favorite episode it is the Sarah's list episode so we're talking about 10 companies that you can become wealthy with without having started it or invested in it or joined [Music] early it's called Sarah's list and I got a little presentation for you if you're on audio get over to YouTube right now CU I have slides that are going to be fun so uh it's called Sarah's list this is Sam's wife Sarah she is hilarious she is on the cover of my first million and the reason why is because she has an unlikely story a story that I hadn't really heard and when I heard it for the first time it kind of shocked me which is I think when I heard this she was about 30 years old at the time she was a self-made millionaire uh but she didn't start a company she wasn't you know killing herself working a 100 hours a week like we were she wasn't paying herself scraps she was getting paid a nice salary with nice benefits she worked at a great company that had good culture she didn't have to make risky Angel Investments and get lucky she was not a high-profile exec that just got you know some huge pay package and she wasn't lucky like the Facebook graffiti guy that just got a bunch of stock from from Facebook and you know made $70 million and so her story was almost incredibly boring it was incredibly simple and I just couldn't believe it I was like I'm trying so hard to make make a million bucks here that was such a better path and so just to recap you know self-made millionaire didn't start didn't have to start the business didn't have to do risk angel Ving did wasn't a high-profile exec wasn't the graffiti guy uh what she did was she joined Airbnb and so if you look at this chart this is airbnb's valuation over time and there was a period when Airbnb started that was the high-risk period That's the flat part of this curve and to join Airbnb then you would had to see something that was not obvious you had to believe something that would that took a huge leap of faith you had to work like crazy in a tiny apartment there's a fun video by the way of them taking like midday dance breaks where they just played a bunch of everyone stands up for their desk and they're dancing you had to do weird startup stuff there's a guy with stinky feet probably that's not even what we're talking about right she joined after it had crossed you know a 10 even right Sam 20 billion do valuation yeah and if I remember correct like they already had that huge office do you remember that huge office had 888 Brandon and I imagine there was like a thousand people plus working there like it wasn't small and you and I were living in s Francisco at the time and it was stupidly obvious like you could have slapped me in the face and they said what's a company that's a winner I would have been like Airbnb is a company that's a winner it was like obvious at the time I had friends at Uber same thing uh Uber was obviously a winner at the time where they were already multi-billion dollar companies but because of the space that they were in and how dominant they were it was clear that they still had room to run and what we call Sarah list is basically a a function of using your time as your investment most people don't think of their job as an investment decision but your time your talent where you're going to spend four years working is a investment decision you should be thinking about it like a venture capitalist and especially if you're working in the tech scene and so these are all venture you know Venture back tech companies that we're talking about so the criteria for Sarah's list uh it's a company that has product Market fit it's just a clear obvious successful company uh doesn't mean it can't fail but it just means it has product Market it's not in the scrappy figure it out phase and and and you know wandering phase of startups it's funded it's growing and You' get a nice salary and benefits they got oat milk in the fridge um and if you joined and you got a $200,000 stock package so that's like you know getting 50 Grand a year of stock so maybe you maybe you got 150,000 salary and 50,000 of stock that could become worth a million plus in the in five years so can it 5x in 5 years we're not looking for Max upside we're looking for lowish downside and enough upside where you can turn you know a $200,000 stock package into you know one two3 million would be the would be the uh outcomes that we're looking for so we did this once in 2021 3 years ago and before we tell you what we picked and how we did we got to time travel back real quick so let's do this fast so back in 2021 this nft sold for 69 million those were the good old days Tom Brady was a football player SBF was a hero people cared about whoever these people are it was a simpler time and the stock market was running up it was on a 10 plus year bull run it had its peak uh in 2021 for The Listener people cared about quote these people these people was Prince Harry and his wife who yeah see I don't even know who it is point point proven thank you I rest my case by the way did you know this Sesame Street and 711 launched VC funds during this time and so they had their own Venture funds everybody was getting in on the game but nothing last forever and so since then just to give you some data here so since then about 36% of startups who have raised money since then have raised at a lower valuation that's not to count the companies that died or the companies that are avoiding raising because they don't want to raise down runs this is like transactions that cleared onethird of them are clearing at a lower price of all startups it's even worse if you look at late stage startups so later stage startups which are the ones we're talking about series C Series D they're down between 30 and 60% on average that's the that's the that's what you're seeing across the board um sad news two-thirds of employees right now that are working at these companies are working for options that are actually worth zero and they probably don't even realize it yet meaning they got a pay package of stock option at a $24 St strike price that stock is currently trading in secondary for $8 so all of their Shares are underwater currently only 33% of the shares are in the money as they say all right so what did we pick we picked about 11 companies I think we shared one um company but we had each picked around here here's how we did so it's not great all the stuff I just told you is basically our big fat excuses as to why it wasn't great we both had two hits so two things that did that did go up in a sort of Step change way you know sort of 3 4X so far in the 3 years uh I had two that were down like valuation lower than it was previously you had three that were down and then there were some pushes and a push basically is like has the same valuation as it had before but that's actually sort of a win because you beat the market so you didn't achieve the sah lless dream but you didn't take the huge write down that a bunch of you're wrong about next Health next health is wrong next health is is wrong on here oh is it actually up well the word NE there's two companies one is next one is next so I think you you there was a little confusing but someone in the research Department's getting fired here no just they're just missing a t uh open store at uh wow so open store is down it's it's unclear but I mark it as down and it's a little intellectual honesty I don't think I don't believe that it has achieved it it's it's uh its status to be called up I we have it as a TBD I gave it a a less generous interpretation of down just to make my own grading harsher this not about them it's about me grading my own picks more more so and you think figma's down too well figma tried to it's not down it's a push here it tried to sell for 20 billion didn't clear that the transaction didn't go through so that would have been you a 2X but then the last I believe round of funding and this by the way this is not all very obvious so companies don't always announc their valuations there's leaked valuations to the media which are not always true there's valuations that come with a bunch of strings attached so maybe you got a a good number but there's all these caveats and liquidation preferences and a lot of this was we asked people who own secondary stock market places we said hey what is this company trading at right now and so it's incomplete information right we're doing the best we can Here With Private Stock information that you don't you don't always have by the way Sarah my wife who this is about had a job offer at figma like three months before their acquisition offer which like it had that gone through I I believe it would have been a 2X return based off the valuation so we almost we almost had a mini hit again but not quite yes exactly all right let's get to the 2024 picks uh we're going to try to do better now the the good news is the the pick any picks you made anything in the Vintage of 2021 like I said earlier the the all the companies basically got shellacked everything got reerrr everything got got corrected but now where we're at I think we are at a a less hypey period of time and so this cohort of picks I think should be better but again not Financial advice really me neither me nor Sam actually uh are trying to go get jobs this is kind of like what we would do if we were going to get a job Sam did this with Sarah when she was looking for jobs so this is for fun uh let's just put that out there we're not given Financial advice here so I have like five or six but then I got a bunch of other ones that were like it's like scrap like I didn't quite get to what do you think is the let's say we each bring five to the table I bet you there's going to be at least three that we are overlapping on what do you think yeah two I'm guessing two overlaps and by the way I'll say I think a good hit rate on this good hit rate would be 6 out of 10 6 out of 10 can have a a step up where 5 years later we're not even 5 years after the the 2021 ones yet we're only 3 years in but 5 years later that there sort of like a four or 5x in valuation if six out of 10 did that I think that would be a a great thing I think uh three out of 10 would be sort of the lowest bar that I would accept hey real quick I want to talk to you guys if you are new to this podcast if you're new to business I have cool resource for you so the folks at HubSpot who sponsor this podcast have put

what are some communities you could join they have some cool resources there so if you're just getting started and you're a beginner in this journey of Entrepreneurship check out this kit the link is in the description below and thanks again to HubSpot for making this podcast possible all right I'm going to go first I'll start with an obvious one it's probably one that you have too open Ai and by the way there are no bonus points for difficulty in business the fact that everybody knows open AI I'm not trying to give you a secret company a secret stock tip you've never heard of the point of this often is that the companies that are going to be big juggernauts are hidden in plain sight so open a currently valued at 103 billion it's doing about three and a half billion a year in Revenue already the bull case so what do you need to believe if you're going to join this company that you that you think it's a sah list Contender it's the first credible Google competitor in about about 20 years it is something that actually could displace replace search which is like you know when people need an answer to something or they need help with something where do they go it's the fastest growing company ever that's nice so it took them you know two or three months to reach 100 million users uh it's five times faster growing than the next fastest product ever it reached three billion in Revenue in the last you know it's in like 3 years is pretty crazy and it's Unique cuz it's an Enterprise company it's a consumer company and it's a Dev tools company at the same time I think that's pretty pretty unique and gives it a lot of upside what you would be worried about if you were looking at open AI is it's probably the most competitive market on Earth right now you are getting comp competition from every the most well-funded startups of the most brilliant people as well as the biggest tech companies in the world Facebook Google Amazon everybody is coming after this market so that's the downside is will open aai retain their lead or not yeah yeah the the problem with open a can you get a job at open AI not only is it the most competitive like not only is it the most like competitive space like I imagine they have to have one of the more competitive uh like job applicant pools dude I read some crazy stat that Tesla has something like 50,000 people a day applying to work there and I have to imagine that open AI uh it's somewhat similar where they are just like inundated with applications well yeah I mean but we're talking our listeners the cream of the the cream of the crop here this is the crem creme so yeah of course they can get a job wherever they want so would well open AI 5X the current valuation yeah I mean yeah yeah that that yep I agree with you um all right you want me to do one mhm all right I've got one called retool do you know what retool is I know retool I use retool and I wish that I invest in retail I tried to invest in retail early on and I missed it I'm not a user of it so it actually would be best as a user uh explain what it is so every technology company has the same situation that they would all home a solution for the situation is you need a back-end admin panel so you have this I'm sure with Hampton where uh oh we need to add or remove a member or hey this person changed companies they're asking if we can update their their thing or hey can we change their membership status from active to suspended or whatever whatever some admin function that you need to do and it doesn't come out of the box with whatever you know you're using 10 tools to run your business but like this is the what's the tool for your business it's a retool is a simple way to make the admin you know uh panel for admin system for your for your company where anybody in the company who's not a developer can actually go in and you know add remove you know make changes to essentially the database that's like the simplistic way of saying it it's basically a backend tool for any business that you can customize and your developers can build once so that anybody in the the team can use so it's a internal tool and here's this crazy stat so the founder his name is David David uh David David's a Baby Genius so David David started this when he was like at the University of Cambridge when he was like 21 years old and he's like he's got one of these like stories where he basically before this business he had a um a payments app that I think did okay but whatever he quit working on it but like when you see like a 19-year-old kid do that you're like okay you this and you have a payments app at 19 you already want yeah and you're going to one of the best universities on earth like all right something is interesting here he gets into YC comes up with this idea and here's this crazy set 50 or 60% like 50 between 50 and 60% of all software in the world is internal facing tools meaning employees who use uh internal facing tools that's a one chart business right there that's a one chart business and not a lot of people focus on that because you kind of focus on things that you see and use versus things on the back end that you maybe you kind of get you don't really touch that often but the business has crushed it and so they launched in 2017 their latest valuation is 3.7 they've raised $150 million from seoa and a bunch of other great companies listen to this growth first 9 months $500,000 in Revenue in 2018 they hit 2 million in ARR in 2024 they hit around 100 million in recurring Revenue so it's got to be one of the faster growing businesses out there and I've been watching interviews with this guy David the founder dude he's amazing uh he's he's an amazing company so at a valuation of 3.7 uh I think there's room to run I think there's a five or 10x potential here uh I mean that's got to be a they got to be be a huge business but the market is just massive and I like the guy I think that's something we're going to see in a bunch of these which is that the CEOs seem to be remarkable in all these businesses and that's just if you're going to make a bet on a private company you want to be at one with like one of these All-Star CEOs my retail story I two two Lessons Learned here one invest in your p&l so I had this problem we we were always trying to build these things internally the devs never wanted to work on it enough because it's an internal tool so who cares and when we got retool like oh this is great this is no-brainer and so I the first lesson I always I always remind myself is the best place to invest is in your p&l meaning look at your expenses and go figure out which of those companies you think other people like you wouldn't want to cancel and other people are going to have as their expense too go invest in that company R tool was one of those and then second thing was I once we got acquired by twitch years later so the first one was probably 2017 2018 the second one was uh 2020 or 2019 I at twitch and EMT who was a YC partner was like I was at a meeting or he was coming to a meeting with me and he was running a little late and he's like oh yeah sorry I was doing office hours with this YC company that just had they just hit this point it's like there's this thing that happens where you go through YC it's all good then you have after YC where you know you're just like you're back to being like a normal struggling company he's like and then sometimes you hit this inflection point and [ __ ] just really starts to work he goes yeah this company retool this really starting to work when you're you know when a really smart friend tells you that something is hitting in inflection point like drop everything and go go go hunt that down I remember at the time thinking I should have invested this I saw the guy at David in the cafeteria cuz he had just met with EMT wearing his retool shirt and I went up to him and I was like nice shirt love retool and then that was it that was my all I needed was that third like a little guy how do I invest he was young I think he I think he was like a college kid almost yeah he looked like he just could have been any employee at the at the company just he was wearing his own shirt anyway so retool I like the pick valuation is high so I think 45x is tough from there right to become A1 15 billion company is tough but but I think it's a good really good company um all right let me give you my next one the next one Mercury you're nding do you have this one it was on my uh I had it on my list and then I removed it because I thought you were going to pick them I I did pick Mercury so Mercury is a company that I use so I'm a again look at look at the tools you use that you don't want to change um so I use mercury for I think not one two but like six of my companies now um it's just a amazing product so the valuation is still in that sweet spot range where it's uh I think it's 1.6 billion right now so the valuation is as there here's the bull case here's what you need to believe it has a rare combination well hold on what what Mercury is just a bank that is built for small businesses and it's easier and simpler to use it's basically just a normal Bank just easier and better if you're a startup and you need to have a bank account which every startup does uh you can use a bank from like you know Bank of America or whatever like like you know some some Traditional Bank where you're going to use their product and it's going to feel like you know a bunch of 50-year-olds hired some web shop to you know Outsource this tool that they needed like the second like second second class citizen whereas Mercury is like oh a Founder made this I get it it solves all of the Pounders all of the problems that a Founder would have I get it and it's true Imad was a founder of multiple startups before he made this and now it's like the best product for startups so product is amazing it has a rare combo it's growing fast and it's profitable which is great because a lot of the companies that get written down or or the risk comes from they're not profitable they're burning so much cash that if the growth ever slows all of a sudden you get this huge discount in the valuation so the fact that this is profitable means there's a margin of safety here Silicon Valley Bank used to be the bank of of choice for Silicon Valley startups it imploded it was a 34 billion doll company with 7 billion in Revenue two years ago and it imploded because they mismanaged risk no nobody has really replaced them I think Mercury is the best position to replace them so if you think about like what's the shoes they could fill they could fill the svb shoes as a 30 plus billion dollar company they're the category leader I saw this great quote from a sequoia partner he said the C category leader in any category tends to get something like 75% of the revenue and 50% of all profits that are going to be in a uh in a market which I I don't know if those numbers are exactly right but it's directionally correct which is that the winners of every category take this Lion Share of the rewards and I think they have a good Mo I think they have a great brand it's letting them get customers you know for free and Regulatory Moe as well which is this is not a simple thing that any you know any person could go start there's a lot of obviously like Financial compliance and regulation now one thing to caveat we called them a bank that's because to the customer it feels like a bank technically they're not a bank who do they who do they use so they use like Choice bank I think an evolve Bank under underneath um so they're what what we call like a Neo Bank you know just like a finance platform basically and the Bear case the other thing that you know the worry would be can they grow with their startups so some products are great because you get them while they're young and you grow with them and other products you get them while they're young and then they graduate off you and as soon as they become really valuable customers they take their business elsewhere I think they're going to be able to grow with startups but that would be the risk here I didn't find honestly much of a bear case do you I don't know if you have I've got a bear case I think I I I almost always B banquet Chase because I've just always been afraid of can I access that my money and it happened recently where a lot of people were using mercury as I mean not the [ __ ] on Mercury they were using lots of different things uh and they couldn't get their payments out or their payroll out uh because of the bank uh the bank are working bank and S and sfb was one of them they they're they're no longer in business because they're this huge company that mismanaged a bunch of stuff and it did work out and so uh yeah I think that's a massive be case I think that the reason I bake with Chase is because if Chase would go out of business and have the issue that s uh Silicon Valley Bank had America would basically go under too big to fail yeah I always knock on wood when I say that but a little bit like that where it's like you know I think Chase is like I I would have to look at the stats but it's something like 5% of like Americans use it so it's like a pretty big deal and so yeah I think that's a bearish case uh as to why so I I don't think that's necessarily a bear case because first of all they have like I think $5 million FDIC insurance now like they offer like 20 times more FDIC protection than than they than they need to or than the average Bank does so I think they've they've got some features that help with that but the other thing is like I think the proof is the pudding which with this which is that if uh while it's understandable to say oh you know I I choose to go with a too big to fail bank if you just look at kind of where the startups are voting with their feet this thing is growing so fast that obviously people are making that choice already so it's not like a future scenario it's like today that choice exists and people are making the choice to go to Mercury so I don't see a reason why that would change later necessarily like usually when I think about a barcase like what could go wrong in the future whereas what you're talking about which is maybe people just prefer to use a traditional kind of 100-year old bank because of the track record they have that choice today and people are like choosing to do the other one so you know I think that's less of a be case last weekend because I'm a client at Chase they gave me box seats to the US Open and it totally worked I'm gonna B with Jase for as long as they'll have me so long as I get tickets to the US Open so as soon as mercury like starts steing these WI perks they ain't [ __ ] like I want I want a [ __ ] fruit basket I want a gift basket if I don't give a gift basket you don't get my business I'm changed man I mean I'll take a 20 piece nuggets from Chick-fil-A like I don't I'm not I'm a simple man I don't need the US Open this is easy oh my God they took me I I got these like amazing seats to the US Open uh and it worked it worked look like it worked I get it I I fell for the Trap and and so but yeah no I think Mercury's a great business I think the founder uh is pretty badass so yeah that that one's good all right so you said that uh you were G to look at like the founders and and or no sorry you said you're going to use your p&l so uh where you spend some of your money I like that I also do like where do I spend some of my time and where do people spend some of their time and so a tool that I'm playing with is called cursor and I think cursor is pretty amazing and so and I'm going to tell you not my story but the reason I've been using it but there was this little girl she's eight years old her father's on Twitter and her father's a developer I guess and her father tweeted something out saying I'm trying to teach my little girl how to code and we're using cursor and here's a FaceTime of her like a loom like a screen record of her learning how to code and within 12 minutes or something like that she's built a website and she used cursor so cursor is this really cool to tool it's got a lot of hype right now it just kind of the easiest way to describe it is it's sort of like Squarespace Wix or any of these other website Builders but it uses Ai and you talk to it a little bit like a person and it makes it really easy to edit code now there's a bunch of pros and cons to this business the pro is I think it's amazing like I think that this tool is awesome I've been playing with it it's super good their ladies valuation is $400 million I don't think that that's insane so that's like there's opportunity there I think that the con and this is a big con which is these website building tools dude their PE multiples are [ __ ] so you look at like Squarespace Wix Weebly you remember all these like they don't trade that well so they can do billions I think your pigeoning as a website builder it's not a website builder it's a it's a IDE you can code anything in you can code anything in it but it's still I think in that category in terms of uh you don't think it's in that category in terms of when you look at compe the uh GitHub co-pilot repet category where it's a where it's a coding environment where a programmer can become now an AI assisted programmer so however good you were however efficient you were however productive you were as an engineer as a as a programmer you can now be you know some multiple more maybe it's one and a half X more more productive maybe it's 10x more productive as the AI improves and so I don't think CU you know Wix and Weebly these are like you know my sister needs a website for her preschool so she goes to Squarespace and makes a website she's not going to she's not going to go to well today she's not going to cursor for that and also those tools could never do what a cursor could do where it could build full applications you know yeah I feel you I feel you I still think that like all right so uh we use I use bubble you know bubble um bubbles like an app builder uh this is a little bit of a competitor to bubble and in my head as an investor and potentially as a user I think it comes into like it uses it's like the same churn as a small b or a website builder where you spend $10 a month and there's not always a massive reason to stay on the platform versus all the other competitors like it's pretty easy just to like up try different ones do you know what I mean and so for that reason I think it's a little bit similar in the terms of in terms of valuation right um okay I have a I have I was I looked at cursor very close in fact they were on my first draft of companies to be on here but then as I did more research I went with another company that you'll see at the end of this so okay but what do you think about cursor for a $450 million valuation what do you think I think I mean I think you're getting high upside High downside there cuz uh you know that valuation is not based on it's not based on Revenue um it's it's based on like you know this this vision of what the future like might look like and that's great and I think cursor's awesome right now if I could invest in curser I would totally invest in cursor right now but I think it is more risky than some of the other ones we've talked about so far I think that's true they're at a $10 million run rate I believe or I don't know if it was run rate or that's actually what they did in Revenue but yeah it's tiny compared to the valuation what do you have then instead what's your competitor to it well I'll show you it's it's my last one but I um can't rearrange the slides here so you're going to have to wait on that um when you told that story about that little girl I thought you were pulling a KLA Harris and you were going to say that little girl was me at the end and I was pretty ready for that emotional Landing instead you were like that was just Somebody's Daughter I just follow grown men's daughters on Twitter I don't know it was where are you getting your Tech advice dude it was are are you did you see that video I did not see that one but I've seen some kind of amazing things like cursor demos right now all the rage dude all the rage all right keep going all right my next one I don't even know if you've heard of this company epis do you know this company no okay so I don't like that name epis yeah epis so this is a Joe londsdale company it is a weapons company a defense company and I don't know enough about epis because it's very secretive company um and it's very private to tell you that this is the pick what I actually did was I put this here as a placeholder as a general strategy so one thing I would do if I was interested in this kind of sist concept finding a company I can go join that the stock is going to be my my stock package is going to be appreciating you know rapidly I'll get a 5x in 5 years I think that the way andril hit for us last time there are now like 10 more andril type of companies that exist that are inspired by andril that are worth checking out andil itself might still be a contender by the way um but there are more companies so epis is basically as like long range you know like defense weapon or whatever dude if you go to website it's epis Inc it basically looks like some type of like electromagnetic thing that shoots like radio waves into the sky and brings down drones and PLS that's exactly what it does it's an EMP pulse that will take down you know a drone or a missile or something like that without being a bomb like you don't have to like you don't have to bomb something you could just disable it it's just magic there's a great story by the way is David bla the CEO cuz this looks magical like when I see like invisible Rays that's such a good pickup line I'm going to use that next time I'm trying to like talk to a Founder be like but are you related to David bla because this is magical is he a cousin um it does look like magic so he told the story where he's like I was like dude how do you sell to these like three-letter agencies and he's like it's very hard you know there's like decades long relationships and with the the traditional companies so I'm like how do you do it he goes well the the big thing we always try to do is get to a bake off he's like we have to get to a point where they're willing to do a contest of our product versus their product cuz we can win on product we have better product than engineering but we don't have better you know good old boy relationships here so we have to get to a bake off he's like so we did a bake off for epis and basically everybody went to this field and they're like cool I'll line up and then uh you're going to go first and we're going to see how far away you can you know disable this and how effectively you can disable this drone uh that was the test and they lined up and he's like handing out binoculars and they're like what was this he's like you're going to need these to see how far away we're going to be able to disable this thing and then they like won the Bake Off won the contract and all this stuff so I don't know about this company specifically I don't know enough but I would go interview at the top 10 like defense weapons companies go talk to all of them and then use your judgment on which of them is the winner I know in that basket there's definitely one or multiple winners that are that are in this I but I from the outside D how do you even get that person so let's say you're Joe lale which like I guess that's kind of answer answers the question because he's a big shot but if you're not a big shot and you want to get like some CIA buyer into a field in Texas to like show up like to to wow him like who do you even phone call you know what I mean like who well I think there's multiple answers to this but I'll just give you a couple of data points so the the very first thing is that there are bids there are like rfps that you can participate in there there are like you know uh the government has a process of procurement where they need to be able to go solicit proposals so you can go look at those you can go talk to those the second thing is when we were at his house after we recorded the podcast with Joe we were walking out and there was like 10 like Senators there for lunch and it's like oh this is how you build your network you you he's like hosting a lunch for like 10 did he like bring you out the back door like like literally well because Elon was coming over and he was like Hey it might be easier for you if you just want to go this way and we were like easier for you or easier for me like uh maybe for both of us all right good fair fair enough uh cuz I'm literally in my basketball shorts did he hand you 20 my backpack and bought you and bought you an Uber he's like don't forget your lunch box and then I like wandered off to a bus yeah was there apple juice waiting for you at the doorway out it's truly how it felt and by the way I couldn't have been happier with the arrangement I did not want to be a fish out of water either so I think that's one way there's also a great story you told on the Pod about like how Peter teal was telling them like dude cuz when they started paler he was like a couple years out of college he wasn't that old yet and he had like a lot of like kind of like the pride in Hues of like uh like a tech kind of like genius type of person and he is you know a genius type of Genius level person but going in and saying you guys are dumb we're smart is not the answer either to sell to these things and so they hired this guy Alex karp who's still the CE of paler and one of the reasons why it was like this guy was just like very very good with relationship building with networking with being accepted by these buyers and he recruited like ex government people to be like openers like warm handshakes to help them get in the room and I think that that's how they got I want to do a um an entire podcast next time just on the New York Times article on Alex karp very funny very good very interesting yeah very good uh all right I buy into that I to to me working at epis or any of these National or these defense businesses it's sort of like working at a porn company where like you like probably most of the work uh might be like tell your mom you working Video Entertainment well yeah like most of the work is like normal like just a normal job it's boring but then like you see the output and it's like [ __ ] like death or destruction or like like pretty like runchy [ __ ] if you're to be fair their tool this ERS tool just in this case is like a non-death tool it's disabling the you know without without bombing anything but yeah yeah definitely some of the other ones are are are a lot more like yeah this is war yeah where like the output of this whether it's right or wrong uh it's still like a you it's you go to bed every once in a while with a heavy heart even if you're doing everything right um all right I have I have another one and I am you know that what is that called that uh mid whip meme where there's people who are on like this the dumb guys are at the far end where they just don't think things or How does it go you're on one of them let's just put it that way you're showing that you got one of the sides nailed there's the be the kind of the beginner the caveman who's just like you know build product talk to customers right and then the Jedi also you know I should just build a good product talk to customers and then the guy in the middle is doing like over analysis overthinking over over everything but I feel like you you did a good job like you know uh like like a mime you like acted out the meme was great I am what I am uh I took that approach with a couple of these dude have you heard of this company called whiz I've heard of whiz I don't know what whiz does I looked at it I was like I don't understand this enough dude all right so check this out so it was um whz is a cyber security company uh for Enterprise uh companies so or Enterprise customers so basically if you have if you're using like large Cloud tools it the tool wiz's tool like scans it and be like all right you have a Potential Threat here here and here for Cy cyber security issues it's the fastest company ever to get to 100 million in annual revenue took him 18 months the guy who started it now this is why where like the mid uh that Meme comes into play here because he's kind of amazing I read this article about him a couple years ago and the opening line is I guess he his first name is Assaf so he's Israeli um and he was like a Israeli defense guy in the military and it said don't mistake aof gentleness for someone who's willing to play by the rules that was the opening line I was like okay what does that even mean yeah it's like a Tinder bio Jesus yeah all right I'm interested and so basically this guy uh he previously had another company that he scaled and sold to Microsoft it was also a cyber security Cloud company he sold to Microsoft for a billion dollars he uh gets through his um his warm-up company yeah his warm-up company he's only 38 years old he gets through his non-compete ever spend his time at Microsoft things go well and then he starts his next company called whiz so far they've already raised $2 billion do of which a uh one billion of that came in one round and the company's only 18 months old which is absolutely ridiculous uh they've done something I think they're already at uh $350 million in Revenue in just 3 years 350 uh annual recurring uh Revenue in 3 years something like 80% of the Fortune 100 companies are already using the tool so they've killed it already now here's where uh things get interesting their last valuation was $12 billion but there was a rumor that Google was going to buy them for $23 billion and so there's all these rumors that this was happening and so he sends an email to the entire company and let me read you a quote he goes the first line let me cut to the chase our next Milestones are a billion dollars in ARR and an IP and he explains how they aren't accepting this offer from Google because they want to like make it big and be this huge thing and I love this guy I think he is just one of the coolest like in most interesting CEOs out there right now what are you looking at what do you think when you look at him well he looks not like what I thought uh actually your first line about like don't let my gentle whatever fool you like I'm here to whatever handcuff you to the bed I don't know what he said but like something like that that's what I heard he's he just looks like a good he looks like Midwest nice guy uh when I look at these photos I was really expecting a lot more hardcore looking of a guy which is just for my Google imars dude when you see a guy wearing a t-shirt who sells to like suits or the NSA or whatever like these like big big shots I think that like you are secretly very dangerous like you know what I mean um let me tell you something here so um okay so check this out there's a part of the whz story that I I think is pretty interesting first of all interesting pick I think they have such a high valuation that you're really betting this is like one of the mega cap tech companies to do this okay fair enough the the thing that scares me is anything that grows this fast you know what goes up must come down in a way this is not it's not as Lindy it's not as you know when something is a slow compounder you actually trust it more than a uh explosive but not like doesn't have a long track record dude but that's the goal of this thing is things that could 5x in three years that's fast growth five years five years yes whatever uh yeah true uh true but I guess what I'm saying is like it might be priced in I don't know so let me tell you something that's interesting about this so when I saw this company's grow fast it's a natural question of well how U have you heard about the story about this guy named Gilly that's associ associated with whiz no but I'm in all right so who is Gilly I don't even know how to say his last name ranan ranan something like that Gilly ranan let's call them dude is all these guys by the way they're Israeli like special force guys so they X Israeli military intelligence yes he also invented capture he invented WAFF which is web application firewalls he did a bunch of other stuff in cyber security he was a partner at seoa very well respected in the cyber security world and he started a VC firm called cyber starts and they're the first investor in whiz now check this out so let me just read you this excerpt the numbers for the for the VC fund cyber stats are phenomenal the fund that specialized in cyber security funded by Gil only six years ago uh here's here's how it goes so 22 companies combined value 35 billion five of the 22 are unicorn so a higher hit rate than YC first and foremost is whiz who's Breaking All the records four of them were sold in the last 12 months so you know like successful exits for a total amount of 1.5 billion in the last three months their companies have raised 1.8 billion blah blah blah blah his his portfolio shows an irr of more than 100% which is you know unusual for even the best performing funds not a single company has failed so far in portfolio and it is currently ranked in the top five of all VC funds in the world due to these achievements okay so then you say well hold on what is what's working what's what's actually happening here and then you say then there's something called the Gil ranan model and basically what he does is he's got this Mafia of the chief the cesos so the the chief security officers um at all these Enterprise companies and they're all in his pocket they all respect him they think he's got the mightest touch he's done so much in the space he builds a relationship with them but then he makes them Al Partners like I think like carry Partners in his fund and so what he does is he basically has like a bribery network is what my understanding of this is not what they called it but like corrup awes corruption's awesome um it's causing uh so it is referred to as the gil runin on model it is causing more I got to stop saying this guy's last name because I'm probably butchering it cause more discomfort amongst Israeli competitors and portfolio companies which are all jealous for obvious reasons it has reached the US where company Executives who are purchasing cyber security systems are as committed to Gillie as they are to their own company and basically what he does is he goes to them and he you know wines and dines them with dinners and conferences but according to several sources he promises teams of fresh graduates graduates from Tech units not only investment support in the startup but initial revenues of 2 million a year this is usually their first year of Revenue which is intended to boost them above their competitors and help them get the next round of funding and the way he does that is by using his network of uh loyal loyal cesos and so the first sales come from the loyal cesos who work with the fund it might be considered small money but the jumps in the uh the jumps and fundraising for cyber security is is difficult if you can get to that 2 to 10 million range you've like you have escape velocity to get to the next round of funding and all that he creates a mechanism that is diff difficult to compete with because the companies immediately jump to a valuation of 100 to 200 million raise more money and have more resources to compete later this seemingly small purchase of1 to $200,000 by the ca will increase the startups value dozens of times this is known as the Gilly model and I think what he says there's something here about like the kickback that they get so there's some here's what he emailed them it is difficult to predict the formance of the fund but according to our forecast the points you have accumulated in the fund so far are valued at X dollar you can expect additional allocations in the coming years and in the new funds we will raise later so it's kind of a you scratch my back I'll scratch yours model I pick winners I just thought this guy was awesome because he wrote cool emails he's got a dope smile turns out you know there's good reason wolf backing him yeah well a lot of them are from uh I think it's called Unit 8200 something like that it's like the NSA of Israel and so if you look at like some of the largest security companies so it's like uh I don't want to talk totally out of turn here but I think it's like pal AO networks and all these like multi-billion dollar companies they all came from that unit and so I it turns out with this guy it's more of a they're they're they're definitely working together but I thought they were just working together because they were all from like the same crew you know it's like they all went to high school together turns out a blood o neither you nor I know jack [ __ ] about this but it sounds like a movie and we're pretty fascinated that's I think that's what's happening here it sounds like some oce love and [ __ ] a big dummy like me came to the great conclusion as uh this [ __ ] smart [Laughter] dude all right what do you got all right my next one is a quick one neuralink so nural link is currently valued at $5 billion it's got like pretty much no Revenue here's the case Elon they put a chip in a guy's head and he's like playing video games on a twitch stream now uh it's pretty crazy the first patient they have a huge technical Milestone was he paralyzed or he had Ms yeah he's a quadriplegic um you so he can't I think he can't move his his arms or his legs I believe and now with his brain he's just playing chess and use he basically can use a computer with his brain now just by thinking okay and he's like wow my life just got so much better this is amazing um and they successfully implanted the chip in the guy's brain and he can now use computers it is incredible I cannot believe more people are not talking about this I'm going to do a whole Deep dive on nurlink just because I think that I'm Blown Away by the videos I've seen and the the the nerdy rabbit holes I've been down for it um to me this is a question of when not if meaning the next platform shift is probably glasses but the one after that or the you know the big one is just put the computer in the brain that will happen it's just maybe it's 10 years maybe it's 100 years I have no idea the other bull case is look even if this doesn't 5x in 5 years you're going to be helping a lot of people out because all their initial customers are people who are you know severely disabled can't see and they're going to make them see they can't hear they're going to make them hear they can't uh move their arms they're going to make them be able to use computers it's it's really incredible so I think they're doing incredible work and you're probably working with really smart people on a mission that matters and you're probably going to make a lot of money doing it the bare case of course Revenue question mark question mark I you know they have like one customer right now right so like it's going to take time long path to success they're kind of at the uh they made the first Tesla Roadster that's where they're at in the uh the Tesla Journey right now dude but you're missing the whole point of this list which is like how do you like not like stress out all the time and like things like that and have a good job all these companies need the they need the personality hire they need the guy who's bringing smoothies to the office they need the guy who's a good time to be around they need the guy's willing to do the Dirty Work and uh go clean up the files and go organize things do you think that Elon has a personality hired yeah I think he does dude I think he's got like literally like meme Lords that work for him so I think he's defin got person person I don't know man I agree with you on so many things I know some dummies that work at Tesla let me put it that way I have some like who's this my cousin works at Tesla and then you meet the cousin it's like does he work like in the tire shop like who's this guy um yeah I feel that but nural Link's not that how many employees do you think they have uh I have no idea I would guess like probably like a 100 is my guess or somewhere like plus or minus 50 I have no clue that's too small to hide you're assuming I didn't say Sarah's list is the chill life it's it's not it's not the vest rest in vest life I I think maybe we have a misunderstanding there maybe Sarah wasn't doing as much work as I thought no it's like a 40 hour work week I I don't know if neuralink is a 40 hour work week if it is then I'm on board okay fair enough fair enough um all right uh I'll do I've got two more maybe all right you had open AI now I want to I want to vote with my attention a little bit I use open AI every day but you know what else I use a ton is perplexity um do you use that me too me too yeah I use perplexity as well now how do I explain the difference between the two I think perplexity perplexity is when you need the answer to be right yeah chat GPT is when you have a variety of random things in ACC not as important yeah if I'm doing research for this pod and I need to say a number that's not gonna be be wrong um perplexity is a better bet than chat GPT so perplexity I think their latest valuation was $3 billion they've raised 415 million bucks uh so it's already like very big but I think the Market's huge I also think when I I find like interesting stories about the founders and I love it so what's the CEO of perplexity I know how you spell it uh Arvin I think is his name uh Arvin all right so there's a funny story about Arvin he grew up in the same area as um the Google CEO and he grew up vegetarian and his mom wouldn't let him eat eggs the the perplexity CEO and uh he like grew up and like no you can't have eggs and he's like I need more protein she's like you can't have eggs so he sees a YouTube video of uh Sundar uh from Google saying yeah I introduced eggs to my diet um in order to like get more protein and then the mother's like okay you may have eggs and so the fact that and he goes on it's not where I thought you were going with the story he he goes on why dude listen he goes on to like have this story where like they're like dude Sara in my household was like God where it was like well if he does this and you must do this and so imagine being raised in such a toxic environment where you are either him or you are a failure and so far he's doing pretty good so like that's again that's like Sam being a dummy and voting on a company just because the uh the the founder is trying to like prove his mother uh you know make his mother proud that's a strong that's a strong motivation so no but I do think the the company is going to get significantly larger like like the episode of like always sunny where Charlie's trying to date and they're like Charlie what about her she's great she's got a good job she's nice she's he's like she doesn't like milk it's like what it's like no she's lactose tolerant it's like you know basically it's like what are your what is your criteria Charlie what are you doing here is this a ridiculous pick or what no I don't I think a lot of people would say perplexity so I don't think your your logic I think is ridiculous I think you're you somehow are landing at the same conclusions as the Geniuses but the way you get there is uh unique I would say no I I I picked it because uh I use it I I've I like in terms of getting uh in terms what's valuation right now uh three three billion bucks uh so a lot but I mean I don't know it's like a fast also seems like a company that could get bought so like you know open AI chat GPT is like aligned with Microsoft and Google's trying to do Gemini and all this stuff but like if perplexity keeps executing you know it's the way that Facebook bought WhatsApp for 20 billion right like at a certain point if you are a better version of their core product of one of these large companies um Google being the kind of the main one you know you're a very good acquisition Target even if you're Standalone business May may or may not reach there I have no idea but like it gives you multiple outs the downside is like it seems like no tech company could do big m&a anymore so maybe that path is not as realistic um but I I don't think it's a bad pick I think perplex is interesting pick do you want to do your your other one and then I have one last one let my last one is traba have you heard about traba I've heard a lot about traba because there's like a traba uh there's like a tra PR Mafia that's out there and it's I am not all right so let me start with I don't I'm not part of that Mafia because I do not want to work there I think it sounds miserable um but there's a bunch of freaks who do want to work there and if you are one of these freaks this is a place to let your freak flag fly um I'm not a fan of it and can you explain that so I think it's kind of like here's a simple explanation of the culture most tech companies are like we value diversity and balance and we want you know well-rounded people and tra's like yo we're doing China in America they're like you we're working like the Chinese over here like we're doing the 996 model we're here to create a trillion dollar company we are going to just like compete ruthlessly to get there and that's pretty awesome let let me explain what it is and then we and then I I have some of their uh I have a little bit from their deck on when they onboard employees but basically traba is uh software I guess would you it's not just software you would categorize as just software it's it's a little bit of everything but it's a uh it's software and a way to get part-time or fast workers when you are a manufacturer or or a big company like that Staffing Industrial Staffing yeah so it's software plus like actually getting the people to show up uh to uh if you're uh a big Factory if you're something where you need uh you know 100 new employees or something like in in a week to do X Y and Z they make it really easy to find and get those people to actually show up on time I think their tr.com their website I think it like that's their tagline which is get Workers to show up on time tomorrow or something like that trit at work yeah tra at work sorry now here's the part where they're they're kind of interesting so Founders fun who I do respect they're like this is probably our Highest Potential startup and they've said that these crazy stories like they've showed up at the office at 1 p.m. and what we've noticed is like the office is still buzzing with people and it feels like the golden days of PayPal and they have these values these values are dream big have an olymp Olympians work ethic which is inspired by Chinese uh China's 996 mentality which I'll talk about have a growth mindset and be customer obsessed and so basically they say dream big we want you to be the number one% in terms of ambition plus the number one% of attitude which is going to allow us to get the number 1% outcome we want you to have an Olympians work work ethic and they basically I think they explicitly said this on their website we have a 996 culture which means working 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. 6 days a week and there's like these interviews with these employees that are like I really wanted that type of work culture and I googled where can I find that and you guys had it on your website and so that's why I decided to apply and work there and so they're pretty [ __ ] sucker born every day it's like I Googled where I can work the most hours and I found you guys yeah they're pretty insane I think they only have like 150 employees I think the valuation is something like uh $150 million I think uh no no it's got to be higher than that I I I don't I I only saw a handful of numbers uh on their valuation is it higher than that maybe I'm wrong maybe maybe it is the the valuation isn't public I think I was trying to like triangulate a bunch of old uh articles and I don't know if there's a current one out there so I can't say exactly what it is uh yeah all I'm seeing is the founders fund $22 million round which yeah that would probably be more like what you're talking about so it could be worth more I don't have the information I just am doing a bunch of guesswork out of uh just articles that were live uh but people say that it's growing like 5x per year which is like huge and a lot of smart people who even though I think they're douchebags like Keith R boy they're behind uh the company and they're definitely smart yeah uh okay all right I like uh I like the pick here I didn't realize their valuation was what it is looks like it's around 200 million yeah I think this is a bet on people right so I think the people behind this company are pretty remarkable they do seem like the Olympians of Founders now the market opportunity is difficult here because there's a lot of companies that get valued as tech companies that are actually something else we work with valued at a tech as a tech company but it's actually a real estate company there's e-commerce companies where they're you know DTC companies where they were valued like they were Tech startups but they were actually you know selling suitcases and shoes and things like that and eventually those Corrections do come and so I think the question here is like is this a tech is it a tech company or is it a staffing company that uses Tech and started by tech people um and you know I'm not in the weeds enough to know but I do know what you said which is that they seem to have a very unique culture it seems like very smart people are very bullish on them and it seems like the founders are in that elite elite level of both ambition and um drive and that's those are good things to bet on in general but you did definitely just hypocritically uh tell me that like two of my pcks were were too too hard to work at and then you picked like literally the one that's like yo our thing is that we're the hardest to work at yeah yeah all right moving on all right what do you have all right my top pick my finale drum I I don't want a drum roll because it's going to seem anti-climatic because it's the same company I picked last time that is not that was not a winner in the last one meaning it didn't 5x the last one it's repet oh man I think I am more bullish on repet than any uh any tech company right now are you so bullish on it that if you could bet all of the money that you have into that company you would do it no I'm not foolish but I would I did invest in the company and I then on top of my fund investment I wrote a personal check on top of that which probably the only one I've done that with so you know my actions do line up with this but I wouldn't bet all of my money on this because I don't need to do that so here's here's my case so three years ago when we did this episode repet was at a about a $1 billion do valuation it had 5 million developers at the time it really had no like AI story or tailwind and revenue was small um to non-existent what was it then um they don't announce they don't say but it's because it wasn't it wasn't a priority and it wasn't meaningful so now Everything Has Changed except for the price so the 5 million developers has become 20 million developers that no AI Tailwind has become a huge AI tailwind and small Revenue has become scaling Revenue he amjad came out and said 2024 is our basically like has been our commercial year like revenue is scaling rapidly dude what's it do okay so what does by the way here's the do you know the repa story it's kind of amazing to be honest so the rep story ISJ grew up in Jordan which is a place I've never been and it's sort of this like you know the world is very large and there's people there's Talent everywhere but the opportunity is not as evenly distributed and so he used to co he used to love programming but he didn't have his own computer at first and so he would go to internet cafes basically borrow a computer and he would Pro he would code he' learn to code but the problem with that was that uh every time you go to an inter Cafe you're going to a different computer and you're not like none of your stuff is saved from last time and and if you ever learned a code like one of the first things you do is you first have to like set up your environment and so you need like your IDE you need to install all the packages for the language that you're going to be using if it's python you need to install those files on your computer for it to work and you need to save those somewhere you need to host it somewhere there's all these things that go into coding and so he had this unique problem which was he wanted to code and he was so disenfranchised where he didn't have his own computer that he was doing at internet cafes for a while then even after that you know he worked at Yahoo briefly like he you know kind of graduated and he was uh still just sort of always annoyed with this like this like friction that it takes to get set up and so he as a side project created this thing that was um it was called something else repple something at the time and uh reppel is this like programming term but basically what he wanted to do was he's like can I make a cloud cloud-based programming environment basically like my environment but instead of it being local to my computer have it be in the cloud he it's because he saw Google Docs he's like oh my God Google Docs is amazing this is um instead of having to have Microsoft Office have this software on my computer have the file on my computer I can just go to any computer anywhere go to a doc the whole editor is built into the website which is amazing I didn't even realize got it websites could do this and wow multiple people can like edit the same Google doc at the same time this is incredible can I do that for coding so that's where he started and so and so he built it as a side project for many years so he worked at Yahoo as a side project then he worked at um Facebook and it was a side project he worked with the guy at Facebook on the team that the infrastructure team and the the guy who created react which is like now like you know the huge programming framework react um and somewhere along the way like rep uh repet basically starts to get a little bit momentum gets like a 100,000 users as his like side project and it was he worked at code academy and code academy was teaching people to code online and they discovered his project they're like dude some random guy from Jordan created a programming thing that like all of our customers who are coming to learn at code academy they could just code in the browser they don't need to have like their own thing and so it's a side project for many years and he wants to make it a main project you know he's not taken very seriously he can't raise any money for it and he applies to wisely three times and gets rejected three times and after getting rejected the third time he's pretty you know discouraged he's like all right man whatever fyc who cares and but the thing was that developers really thought this was cool cuz it was like kind of a technical achievement to do this to do this he had to like write his own compilers and write his own [ __ ] that like would work in the browser it worked with any language and so um there was for example a u atlassian created a competitor to this called glitch and atlassian had like a good track record of like Trello and jira like they built like developer friendly tools so glitch comes out huge PR move raises a bunch of money and they said it's coding in the browser he's like oh no they're doing it he goes but they're like it's all JavaScript because JavaScript is everything he's like well I made this choice this technical choice to support any language and these guys are saying it's all JavaScript and initially they got this huge boost but he started to notice that like this little language python started to get really popular on rep and he's like I think they're missing the boat I think python is the thing and python became the language of choice for machine learning it became the language of choice for backend development it became the language of choice for a bunch of like big waves and he was the only one that could support python so glitch ends up dying that lassan company ends up ends up failing on in it and he just keeps chugging along and so along the way he he had this like kind of Indie support so it was used by a lot of students a lot of teachers a lot of coding boot camps but that was kind of looked at like a toy like oh that's cute but those are just like beginners who have no money who whatever yeah I'm reading about them on Hacker News like he was controversial there but a lot of people loved him some people disliked him early on he was really loved on hacker not him but like repet was really Lov it's like kind of cool that you could do this and it actually worked really well cuz he's you know great programmer and one person who was reading Hacker News really liked it and that person was Paul Graham now Paul Graham had retired from YC he was living in the UK in this like mansion and um he's not a part of YC anymore and omj got rejected from YC three times but Paul Graham was like dude I think this is awesome and he tells Sam Alman who's running YC at the time he's like you got to talk to this company rep so he goes to meet Sam at at the time was a hybrid office of open aai and neuralink before open was a big deal back when open ey was just a research nonprofit and he meets Sam and Sam's like hey um you know I don't know anything about you but Paul really likes your thing and he wants me to check this out and um you know what you should just like talk to Paul he told me but like I'm not the guy for this you should talk to Paul here's his email so anjad ends up trading emails like long emails he he said like I should turn this into a book someday of like my emails back and forth with Paul like the philosophical Foundation of replic which was like What if you could enable like 10 times more programmers in the world because this whole thing was about opportunity so how do you make a programmer who doesn't even have their own computer who doesn't know how to start who doesn't know how to like get everything installed and their environment all this stuff how do you decrease all the friction and eventually in even in his initial like plan was like we'll have ai that will help you code it'll be your pro your programming assistant this was back before AI was a thing this was like 2014 right like people weren't even talking about AI back then and it's in his original slide deck I have a a slide here for you let me show you this was his master plan for a c deck we're going to grow by building tools signing up teachers and students we're going to build a simple Network and an AI assisted interface that blurs the distinction between learning and building and eventually we'll become a platform where people come to learn how to code code explore and host their code um this is exactly what they've done it's like the Tesla master plan 10 years later this is his master plan 10 years later they've done exactly this the company's 10 years old now more than 10 years old basically he I think he started this stuff like before 2014 and so it was again it was a side project for a long time only became like a fulltime project and there's like he shared the email like hey got rejected again from YC um and he's emailing Christina who was his first investor Christina is the founder of vanta another company I was going to put on this list she wrote the first check into repet um as a scout and uh vanta is a company that you know in five years has reached $100 million she went through YC but the way she did it was she just yoed it she just like moved to a city and he he writes this email to Christina he's like got rejected again hard to raise money right now I might just YOLO just move somewhere low cost and just start building this thing um that's that maybe was what I'll do and so look at this chart now so this is rep developers year-over-year it's literally like a perfect hockey stick and Paul Graham posted this and he's like the crazy thing about this is that this is this is an impressive chart for any company let alone a company where the users are developers meaning all of these developers are going to build things that they has their own user base that is crazy um and so this is the growth so back when we did this in 21 we were here and now we're here how many developers are there uh so GitHub has about a 100 million wow wow wow wow wow by the way GitHub some crazy stats on my research of GitHub GitHub is used by 90% of the Fortune 500 it probably has like the most Enterprise penetration of anything besides Microsoft Office um like Salesforce is 80% GitHub is at 90% which is pretty what did they uh get sold for so GitHub sold back in 2018 for 77.5 billion dollar and at the time they were doing about 250 to 300 million in Revenue GitHub now does about two is about a$2 billion run rate and by the way the fastest growing feature the thing that makes up 40% of the growth of github's Revenue growth is co-pilot is the AI assisted coder that now does you know a few hundred million a year in Revenue already after you know just a couple years profitably and so that is the most successful you know AI uh implementation in any in any company so far is github's cop 300 400 million a year product why why do people dislike this guy is he aggressive well he said something which is just like you know uh Hacker News is you know when you're the underdog they love you and then as soon as they hear your big funding round they they go and they just say how terrible you are there's Al there's there's you know whatever there's people I actually included uh this is part of my bull case is they got the kiss of death so it says they raise this money and then Here Comes this guy B fan says this is another company I felt SK imploded they don't do anything that's that's interesting let alone proprietary uh the CEO is an ass and everybody knows it he acts as if a browser a browser reppel is going to change the world I have no idea how their valuation is so lofty but the core technology is so easily duplicated yeah go go ahead go try it um since the uh since the heavy lifting lifting they used to do has become obsolete so classic you know go read this the launch of Dropbox and Airbnb and other companies like this this is like uh you know there's always one of these comments at the top of their their their post that you want to frame so check this out this is the AI growth so the thing the criticism of repet would have been great you're getting a bunch of developers but they're all young and how are you going to make money off of students and teachers and I think the the Misunderstood part of this right because if you want to find something at a low valuation it's not that low valuation is just another way of saying misunderstood and mispriced so what what it would be misunderstood here what what would you need to believe the thing you need to believe is is that this is a leapfrog technology so like I don't know if you've ever seen those graphs of like in Africa it's like landlines like landline adoption of mobile of phones in in your home was like really really low or bank accounts was really really low was like you know some I don't know 10% of the population had bank accounts and land landline phones but then and so you would think oh if this is linear you start with a landline phone then you get a cell phone or you start with a bank account then you start getting uh Mobile Pay like venmo or whatever um actually those are easier to adopt because they're on your phone they're quicker they're lighter weight and so cell phones and mobile payments became this like huge adoption and Africa actually has a higher rate of mobile payments than America it has a higher rate of cell phone adoption than America did at the time because it was e it was a Leap Frog technology it was easier to adopt the smaller thing the ear the newer thing than it was to adopt the old thing and so um one of the things that AMJ said I really like to goes um you know people all the criticism of rep is great beginner people use replic because they learn how to code and it's just really easy to get started and the criticism is that like you're not going to get like big developers to switch you know you know 20e vets to switch to to repet and he goes that the better question is if I have 20 million uh you know sort of earlier on in their they coding career coders right now and this is a place where they can get started with no friction build in any language that they want they have ai co-pilot built in they can host it they don't need to know how to set up their servers and there's a community of other people that they can like you know borrow code from and share from and and answer questions with why would they ever switch like you're saying people will never switch from that to this you're like like these people will never switch back to oh actually go make your life harder a great Point what valuation did you invest in I think like 900 million um how'd you meet him I've never met him in person this is a company I kind of admired I used it and I went you know just looked at him and read about it and it just immediately was it it ticked my boxes U so by the way this is kind of interesting so jet brains which is another one of these like the the probably the most popular coding uh environment for like Java developers it's a bootstrapped company that does 270 million in Revenue 100 million in profit 134 million a year in free cash flow with 6 million users um Z doar raised since it started in in the year 2000 and so like I think you know when you look at what is rep's revenue potential I think it's it's a lot bigger than this because this has multiple things so what do you think they're worth right now what what is rep worth what do you think they're worth today well their last valuation was 1.1 billion I know but what do you think is like if they were to raise again it would be uh at what valuation you couldn't buy my stock you'd have to pay you'd have to pay like a $50 billion valuation to take my stock right now like I would rather just hold the stock and see where it goes why because you're looking ultimately in in Tech investing for giant winners uh I think a VC once he told me he's like first talk about unicorns I want Godzilla and he's like basically a Godzilla company he said you know a company that becomes worth 50 to 100 billion plus and he's like those are the ones that make your career and so I was like cool cool branding um he but but what do those companies have Network effects this is a network effect business where it's a network of developers um it's growing like a staff infection at Spring break so it's growing really fast like since the last time we did the Sarah list it's grown 4X in terms of the number of developers who signed up for should call the F like looks like you got a real ring rim on your hands congrats dude exactly like I think it's mispriced and misunderstood I think it gets discounted for being just something for beginner coders when I think actually it's like a Snapchat or whatever it's it's a product where that's the generation you want is the people who are going to be using this thing for the next you know 20 30 years uh it's riding a huge Tech wave in that like uh it is perfectly positioned to uh ride the AI wave because AI programming is a thing yesterday Serge bin was at the all-in conference and he's like yeah I code with AI like he's like he's like yeah I got back into coding use AI basically I just kind of tell the AI what to do it's like dude the founder of Google is like Yeah I wanted to build this thing but I just it's easier actually just for me to just tell AI to do and it kind of wrote all the code for it was awesome he's like then I showed it to my team at the like Google like AI thing and he's like he's like I told them I said more of you need to be using this and he's talking to like the top programmers in Google um uh which is kind of amazing D this is awesome I think you got to ask this guy out for prom I think I just did I think you just did is this like you asking Taylor Swift you know like someone this is um you've convinced me what's the downside I mean what what is the downside uh let's see I mean you had that for every company that they're not going to be able to make as much revenue as you think that people will graduate off of rep and decide that are they remote are they remote company no actually another another Sam bull signal they're not remote and not only that they move from SF to Foster City to like build their own cult there and he's like why wouldn't we why wouldn't we move 40 40 minutes out and uh just make be like the kings of this little area and have like the best the best environment without the problems of San Francisco but still being in uh still being close enough to the talent density I think that um you used all this great logic and all these silly arguments and all these numbers and facts and data you should just told me that he wanted to build a a commune in Foster City I would have I would have been on board I do any deadlifts you like that I know you like that does he really deadlift yeah he's a powerlifter yeah I mean power lifter power gains like it makes sense I think my my simpleton strategy can almost be as effective as yours if you look at the our last um our last I think our lives would say yes it does right like there's no knock on that I I drive to be more like you I think you you have it right no I'm only teasing it's part of me is being simpleton just because I literally don't understand that like when you're explaining that to me I'm like I have to learn what all this means as we go um yeah it's [ __ ] complicated they never tell you the story about dude these guys are geniuses by the way these guys are geniuses to like and be able to invent things like this I just think I just like I'm like we're not the same well I wrote two words that I would almost never write in a side deck I wrote Mission driven and Visionary full repli and those are so cringe you can't you're not even really allowed to say those unless there's an exception which is this dude from Jordan who was like God I really want to increase access to for kids like me built this as a side project when there was no money on the line there was nothing for years just kept kept tinkering away building it building it building it um in his master plan from 10 years ago in the seed deck was talking about how he's going to have an AI assistant in your coding terminal that's going to help you write the code uh and did exactly what he wrote you know 10 plus years ago that is Mission driven and that is visionary to me well Mission driven being into Mission driven and Visionary stuff that's only cringe when it's not true when it's true it's awesome well it's because yeah because it's gets abused right it gets it's like gets used and abused by everybody there's no like there's no um there's no earning that badge right you just get to use it if you want which bastardized it but like you know you look at something like neuralink or whatever um and you got to give credit to these people like you know when there's there's videos of Elon talking like you know decades ago about the four or five like most important things to do and he's like you know the the Advent of the internet you know U creating clean you know sustainable energy future uh creating artificial general intelligence safely he literally been saying these things for for so long you don't need to be Mission driven and a Visionary on world changing things to be intoxicating like that that makes it awesome but you can like if I meet someone who's into something uh like relatively trivial and they're they're passionate about it I still I get like turned on you know what I mean dude the Nick Gray episode it's like this guy his his Rockets to Mars is like the two-hour cocktail party right it is helping people toot their harmonica and have a good time for two hours and much strangers to make some friends and he is more into that than anybody I know than uh than probably anybody that there is uh he wrote a book about the thing for God's sake and then on top of it even though I literally don't want to do that like I would hate if I had to host one of those things I love being around Nick because that energy is so like you said intoxicating it's the perfect word for it yeah when I um and so when I see a guy like this rep thing I'm like I don't really care about any of that stuff but I care that you called your shot and I'm into it uh during covid when we all had to work from home I got to hear Brian chesky give these um like monthly or uh weekly meetings and he was like in his bedroom and he looked horrible he looked like [ __ ] uh because like his business was like on top of the world and then it's like I don't know if we're going to be in business and I have like 3,000 employees and like travel is literally the worst thing on earth like airb is paused uh and I remember seeing his talks and I thought like dude I will I want to fight for this guy like if if I was on his team he has got me bought in um and that and so my point being is that mission driven and uh uh Visionary attitude that is actually really important when it comes to a value how valuable a startup can get uh I think it is if you're making your bet which is what we talked about basically take taking your time and your talents and betting on one company a super concentrated portfolio where you're going to in you basically you're getting A1 to $200,000 bet that you get to make on a company when you when you take a job at one of these tech companies you might as well bet on the most talented most driven you know Mission oriented sees the future more than anybody else type of founder because it's their decisions that are going to trickle down down um I remember I made a ethereum well ethereum is probably one of the best investments I ever made and I made it more on the Sam criteria I was like this gangly Ultra nerd who's saying words that I barely understand this Founder's got the thinnest neck I've ever seen I'm in and everything I read about the I was like so at like 16 he's like or whatever 18 he's writing articles for Bitcoin magazine cuz he was so enthusiastic about it and he was getting paid for Bitcoin which at the time was like $12 per article and that's kind of like how he you know um he he is he's truly like of this he didn't come when it was time to get rich he was there before and then I remember when ethereum hit an all-time high and everybody on Twitter was basically like Lambos and Yachts and you know like pumping their bag he posted a Twitter thread that was like hey this is great but like how many of the unbanked have we banked how many people have we actually helped how much of the mission are we actually doing like yeah the price went up but who gives a [ __ ] and that is you know the best Founders do that when morale is low like the Brian chesy example they give you that conf they never let you get that low they like bring you up and when hype is high they bring you back down to reality of like what are we here to do and that that I when I saw that and I was like this guy is crypto is full of potential but it's full of Pumpers it's full of you know people are going to take advantage of this I at least trusted that that the person who was stewarding that project was not you know to use Bachelor terms they were here for the right reasons vitalic is here for the right reasons uh he was there to actually you know like help humanity and build build a free economic system to use what terms The Bachelor you you don't know that that every contestant I play sports watch Bachelor you're like I have triceps and biceps my tea levels are over 300 so I don't I could tell you the difference between a barbell or a dumbbell bench press and why why each is good you can tell me all about the golden Bachelor yes I can you're absolutely right priorities um all right that's the Pod that was good thank you Sean thank you Ari thank you to uh everyone listening [Music]

I remember hearing at one point that only 2% of the Indian population paid taxes really the majority of the population just simply didn't pay taxes this is a big problem in India cuz they're not banked either so it's like there's no way to track anything cash economy you don't have a bank account taxes no it's not for me yeah it's optional but I think that might have changed this was like 10 years ago I heard that stat and I was like what the hell I'm sure that's changed over time

My First Million is a HubSpot Original Podcast // Brought to you by The HubSpot Podcast Network // Production by Arie Desormeaux // Editing by Ezra Bakker Trupiano

Transcript Language: English (auto-generated)
all right so we got to talk about this this business is really really cool it's a product I want to use and I think it's a business that could be kind of big revolutionary [Music] maybe yeah you probably saw this because it's been going viral over and over and over again and I always look for products that have this playground virality meaning anytime somebody shows you that you're using it or they share a picture of it it immediately Sparks a big reaction and so I saw I'm going to share these three posts so there's like check these out the first one is this Reddit post and so I go on Reddit and I see this post and it's in the r damn that's interesting subredit which is one of my favorite subreddits and it's basically a video of somebody inside this venue and it's like a sports bar meets IMAX so you're sitting there you've got a beer you're just hanging out with your friends but 's a giant screen it's almost a dome that's over you where it looks like you're front row at a football game in this case and they're cheering and their crowds went crazy but it it it looks like you're in the stadium but you're not in the stadium you're just in a bar and this is called km or as I'm calling it The Minis sphere some people have probably heard youve probably seen the the sphere in Las Vegas it's this giant huge Dome that's uh you know in the middle of Las Vegas and it's this insane $2.3 billion doll project that is you know just remarkable it looks like it's kind of cool it's like one of those things where it's like humans built the pyramids and then we built the sphere it's like is Marvel of uh of engineering and Technology well the cosm is basically a minis spere so it's like a 2,000 you know seat venue that you can use for sports games and all this stuff and now they got a couple of them popping up I think this is really cool I think it rides on a bunch of big trends so it's you know uh out of home entertainment I think is a big deal I think people are looking for places to congregate to drink to eat and to enjoy themselves and movie theaters are sort of stale like I think streaming has sort of kicked movie theaters ass in a way and now this is the out of home way of punching back this thing I think is going to be a much better way to watch live events and live sports than sitting at home yeah so basically if you're listening um if you see the photos it's as if they so they build this massive it's not even a bar it looks like it looks like a science center it's like a huge building that they're building just for this thing and you go in and it's like as did you ever go as a kid to the Science Center where it has the Omnimax yeah like a planetarium where screens All Above you that's basically what it is but they had to raise $250 million to to build this because it's like a massive no they just raised that so they just raised that a few months ago they built the first two without or they built the first one at least without that because that was in July who funded that so the story of this is there's a guy who's behind it and he started one of the biggest real estate property management software companies I think called Real Page the guy's name is Win oh yeah uh something win so he has this thing called Real Page Real Page got bought by Thomas Bravo for like 10 billion dollar this guy made a couple billion dollars out of it he then starts his own kind of by the way you might be confusing the name Steve win is the guy from um Las Vegas the casino guy yeah I think this guy's name is also win but it's w yeah so oh that's it's a different Steve win that is that is behind this one and so he uh he's got this Venture Capital firm m capital so he basically what he did was actually pretty interesting so you said it's like a planetarium no no no it is a planetarium do you know the backstory of this no I no so he went and bought three companies so he bought the companies that make the science planetarium things for every you know Museum or whatever like you know science place so they he bought that company then he bought another company that you know did the LED screen part of that then he bought another company that was like the like cameras and technology part of it so it's a rollup of three or four companies now at this point that he did and because of that they have you know they're basically the Monopoly on um I I mean it's not a monopoly as and nobody else can do it but they're the biggest player in developing this type of technology these types of screens what he did was realize hey this is cool but it doesn't have to just be for for the planetarium like you could use use this for sports if you send your own video crew to go film like the the sort of Courtside or fieldside seats at these different venues and so they do they're basically a full stack thing so they have the rights with the leagues uh like UFC for example they have the rights with the UFC they have the rights with C certain football leagues and they go they send a full production crew there so it's not just what you're it's not just what you see on TV but bigger it's its own thing and so they have like Crews that are almost like VR where you see like they're right there by the end zone and then as the guy crosses the camera is turning with them and then they have a live production team that's basically cutting between the different cameras that they have to show what's going to be on that huge screen and so that's how they actually made this that's the backstory of how they did this that's that's amazing I did not realize that that's how it started all right real quick I want to talk to you if you are new to business if you are just getting started maybe you're new to this podcast you're trying to get out there and do your first business there's a lot of people who listen to this podcast that fall into that category and HubSpot has made something pretty cool for you most people in your first business you might do something like freelancing or being a solopreneur it's an easy way to get started you don't need to have a lot of money it's a great way to build skills and build that monthly cash flow but knowing where to start is not super easy the folks at HubSpot have created a kit that you can go download it's a it's a ultimate entrepreneurship kit for people who are really getting started in this journey they also have a solar preneurship guide that will give you sort of the mindset that you need to go on this journey check it out it's the ult entrepreneurship kit the link is in the description destion below this video check it out and enjoy I really want to go to one of these I've had a friend who uh his name's hat I think you you know hat he went to the one in Dallas and he sent me a video of it do not have a friend named hat who's who is our friend named hat he he he messaged us about he hosted the Dallas MFM meet oh okay gotcha uh friendly you're friendly with a guy named hat and he uh he sent me a video and he was like hey I'm in Houston and it was a some sports games some sport game and I was like that game's not in Houston and he's like no no no this is a screen right like I'm not here right now this is a screen and I genuinely thought he was there and so like I would pay I'm I as soon as UFC is on this I'm gonna be paying money it is this weekend actually so this weekend's uh sphere the the the fight card they're having at the sphere I believe is going to be shown in the cosm so they they basically have a mix of things because it's not just Sports so there sports but then they got cir to solay and so if you want to go see o but you want to see o like in the best seat that ever existed plus the backstage plus follow with one of the performers Plus in the air you can go watch o at this thing and so I was doing the math on this and I I don't have the exact numbers here but here's here's the rough math on a venue like this so they have general admission which is kind of like standing room only you could just literally there's people just sitting on the floor and those are 22 bucks so super cheap and they're going to make the money on those people through you know beer and and french fries or whatever then they have the like booths or tables type of thing which is each seat there is kind of like between 50 and 200 bucks depending on the the day and the the event and they could fit you know a th000 general admission and a th000 you know premium people into this thing but they have shows all the time because they have like the cirto thing they have this like Art Exhibit thing they have a orbital thing that's space then they have sports and so they have 64 events this month like in the next coming month and I don't know what I don't know how you know what the occupancy is like but it's pretty easy see that this thing is probably somewhere between you know four to six million a month in Revenue right now not counting all the alcohol sales so you know that that might be double uh you know over there so I I would say low-end maybe three to four million on tickets and on the high and then you know double that once you once you factor in all the food and alcohol purchases I talked to this guy the other day and for MoneyWise we did this podcast with him and he basically made something like $25 million he like owned a a tech company he sold it he got 25 million in cash he still owns 25 million in equity in the business and he's based out of uh Canada inside of a a 2,000 person town and he sold the business made his money whatever and he still has his office in that small town and he said in the small town of 2,000 people he employs roughly 50 of them and he owns the fanciest office building on the Main Street and they have barbecues and [ __ ] like that every week where the community come and hang out whatever and it made me sad that I make a make money on the internet and that I make money remotely with the remote staff because it's hard to see the magic that you're working so hard to create or hopefully your output is Magic where you create products and services that people love and it made me really bummed and I was like I want to get into like more physical stuff or to be able to like physically see my creation even if it's just like employees in an office and when I see products like cosm it seems trivial like oh we're just doing it's just like a place where people could drink beers and watch sport but that's it's more than that and to see this as your output of like I'm creating something that is physical that I can go and see and be proud of while people are watching and enjoying it I am envious of that as someone who does mostly watch sport drink beer but they can watch sport drink beer in front of a huge screen a big ass screen no I know what you mean I I would feel that way but I've done a restaurant I have an e-commerce thing that has physical products and I've also done some events and every time I've done any of those things I hate it I'm like oh my God this would be so much easier I would enjoy my life so much more if I could I am so much happier sitting behind the computer on my laptop in my boxers you know I told you the Peter levels photo of him sitting on a couch with his neck scrunched in the worst posture no shirt boxers laptop on that to me is the Jordan logo dude that is that is the Jord that is somebody dunking from the free throw line of life and and that's what I want I don't want any of this [ __ ] where I have to like have a brick and mortar venue I know it sounds romantic but no can I tell you something that's gonna sound stupid and ridiculous but I think it's true and it's gonna make a lot of money stupid and ridiculous but I think it's true it's gonna make a lot of money damn dude did you just do a personality test that was awesome just described yourself is that your bio yeah there's people who are like efgs or whatever have like an i d o i d it's the new Myers brick dude that was awesome yeah I D iot what are you oh are you an e aarin um listen to this so you know how like let me let me think how what's the best way to phrase this because we're coming from a morons perspective all right uh so there's something that I think has not been like touched on for forever for at least in the startup world and it bothers me and the reason why it bothers me is because Tesla when that came about that was like oh my God this is like the craziest thing ever know would ever touch us but but it it has worked and now rivan and there's other now car startups same with SpaceX SpaceX when they started it was like this is ridiculous you can't make a hardware company that goes to space that's ridiculous now we have andrel we have a bunch of other stuff like that and they're getting funding and they're proving that like this is a good idea there's a category of products inside your your home you probably have used this product today that it boggles my mind why there's no innovation so to put this in perspective I believe all right so there's about 15 million cars sold per year there's about 13 million units of this product sold per year basically everyone in America has them they cost thousands of dollars the lifespan of these products is like five years and that is the washer and dryer it boggles my mind while we've not seen more Innovation with the washer and dryer and yes I'm going to say I say washer because with an R that's a weird Midwestern accent I'm going to get that out the way because people are gonna make fun of me but what's been killing me is and I've said this for years that there's not a good twoin one washer and dryer so this company called LG they came out with this like washer and dryer the other day that it's a two two in one washer and dryer and it was on the Wall Street Journal and it there's videos on YouTube talking about this washer and dryer these nerds like me who are like into this technology they're like going bananas uh that this technology has actually is actually coming to fruition which basically being the main critique of the washer and dryer in one is that it was really hard to create a so when you have a washer that means it has to be water sealed but when you have something that's water sealed it's hard to increase the temperature so how do you put heat in there to dry your clothing and that technology is actually really hard but these guys have actually like they're slowly getting around to where it's actually working and it's amazing how big some of these businesses are uh that sell just mostly washer and dryer so if you look at Whirlpool I believe what Whirlpool is publicly traded last year they had $22 billion in sales and about half of that Revenue was from washer and dryers and what's crazy to me is that that's compared to rivan which is a venture startup now I think it's publicly traded $2 billion doll a year in sales right and so like it's crazy to me that a lot of these sexier Industries in the hardware space cars Rockets self-defense are getting funded and are like popular but the washer and dryer in particular I'm making a prediction that in the next 10 years maybe 15 we're going to see a lot of movement in this space and I think the appetite is big and I'll give you another example there's this company called impulse Labs have you heard of impulse Labs no I've never heard of them so impulse labs and you can make the same case that I made for washer and dryers you can make that case for ovens or stove tops but if you look at stove tops the majority of homes in America have electric stove tops and electric stove tops are a huge pain in the ass because the way they work I believe is that there's basically only one temperature and so it's like an on or an off and so when you use an electric stove top even though you put it on high that just means that it's going to like self-regulate to where it's going to stay on for a certain amount of time and then turn off for a few seconds and then turn back on and then turn back off to a point where it's high then with medium it's going to turn off for longer and then you know what I mean it's going to like try and stay at that same time that's actually like makes a huge difference in your cooking if you're into like cooking nice meals and it's a huge pain in the and so these guys called impulse labs they have built this technology to where you have a battery that's charging all of the time and that battery when you want to use your stove it like turbocharges your stove top so it keeps the heat at a steady temperature and it gets hot really really fast and so they've launched these new stove tops and when I hear their argument about how big this business can be I kind of have bought in to like I think this actually can work now the downside is that you have to raise hundreds of millions of dollars potentially but when you're thinking about stov tops and washer and dryers these are actually really really big markets right like like this like similar size of car companies but are drastically underfunded potentially have less competition than a lot of these other uh Industries because there's not a lot of startups attacking this well I think this is pretty interesting but I'm G to poke a few holes in your argument there's many but this argument that I've presented it's like we're going to call this string cheese swiss cheese I think is the way look no it's string cheese there's no there's ways around it PE back some holes in this in the string cheese here let's keep the analogy going so the problem with the kind of rockets and or um cars and let's just take cars for example I think the reason that rivian and Tesla have so much had so much heat when they came out even though they weren't selling that many units was people see that there uh first of all cars are much more expensive than washers and dryers so that's the first thing multiple of maybe 10x higher higher price per unit so yes they sell the same number of units but at least 10x higher maybe 20x higher in a lot of cases on top of that um you buy multiple of them so like I don't know when you get like I haven't replaced a washer and dryer in five years since I've been living in a place well have you lived in one home for one place have you lived in one house for five years but is that the is that the shelf life of these things you have to replace them after five years is okay gotcha the other part of it that I think is is hard is with Tesla and and rivan I think the thesis is that all cars eventually go electric so you basically take the entire fleet of cars and you say these are all going to have to switch to electric and that the traditional car makers are not going to be these guys will figure out how to rant production before the traditional car makers figure out how to go electric and I don't know if that's proven out to be true or not I mean Tesla has obviously beaten the traditional car makers and I think Tesla's worth more than like all of the other you know next five car makers combined type of thing it's ridiculous and whereas I don't think the two in one necessarily maybe maybe it's true that two in one basically replaces all all combos I'm not sure the last thing I would say is that a lot of these have like switching costs so for example you know this stove top even if I like it I'm not going to rip out my stove to do this it's only going to be let's say new builds that are going to put something like this in like this stove top whereas with a car the switching cost is lower because I can always get a second car I can my I can trade cars it's not the same as like ripping up my kitchen in order to get the so I think that's the hard part about some of these is you have a lot of capital and a lot of difficulty but some pay out you know 10 or 100x and that's why the funding goes to the space companies goes to the military you know weapons companies and goes to the car companies before it's going to go to some of these that being said I have the I have the June thing uh I have the June oven and I gotta say it's good but it's complete Overkill and so I think the hard part of this is like like I don't know if you used it but there's a camera inside of it so you put a bagel inside and it just says wait wait wait I got it bagel and I'm like yeah cool still got to push toast uh like the fact that this camera was in here that recognized the bagel is like a cool demo But ultimately like not that important of a feature compared to you know just like not being $ thousand dollar right the I think the June is like $1,000 or more so yeah I'm not I'm not super convinced on these but I do like where your head's at which is what are these sleepy industries that need Innovation where size is there sleepiness is there but the Innovation is super low that in general is a is a good place to go if you're really determined and can make some [ __ ] happen you know who kicks ass in one of these spes is shark ninja have you heard of shark ninja like they make ninja and shark it's two different brands but under one company shark ninja I believe it's a bootstrapped company started in 1994 it got bought and went public but within six years they were doing 100 million in Revenue within within year eight they were doing uh $250 million in Revenue based out of Boston American company the products that they make amazing they have made some of the best products so like their vacuum is amazing I own the creamy which is like the greatest thing ever they helped innovate and create the air fryer some of these Appliance businesses have been shockingly good and surprisingly bootstrapped well you know my favorite one of these that's like not as hard to do but uh also kind of a sleepy industry is hexclad do you have hexclad do you have any their pans I'm thinking about buying some so convince me why I should buy them well dude I don't know I think you know one of the things here is like uh customer has like a different like awareness and sophistication level so I don't actually know what would make a great pan if there I'm sure there's people out there who are like no no no only cast iron or only this type of pan or it's all marketing whatever but I'm in the bucket that's like the fat part of the bell curve where it's like yeah marketing just kind of works on me um right like I saw that Gordon Ramsey invested $100 million into hexclad which is wow stunning amount of money and let me make how does Gordon Ramsey have $100 as I say that out uh let me make sure that I I have this right so I guess his studio so Studio Ramsey Global a partnership between Fox and Gordon Ramsey is investing 100 million into he so not him personally let's say but him and his Venture Studio or whatever his Venture Venture firm their website is beautiful and I want to buy hexclad right now because of their so I bought it the pans are pretty good uh I don't know again if they're the best pans ever but they're they're good and The Branding is great the visual of it so like the pan itself has little um hexagons as the bottom of it so it's like instantly recognizable product like when I look in my cabinet I have like all my generic pans and then I can literally just see the difference of a hexclad pan and it's like ties to the name and then you have Gordon Ramsey as the influencer behind this and it's just pant dude it's like a sleepy industry that everybody needs it's a high value High aov product and these guys Crush they do hundreds of millions in revenue and uh you know they're they're sold in Costco they have like amazing distribution I think they're one of the biggest Shopify stores overall and it was such a non like I don't want to disparage them by calling it non- Innovation but it's not rockets and it's not electric cars right it's like non-stick pans but it is it is very well done and uh I'm very impressed with their execution and it's a great business were they just was it just get a person here's what it says 2013 the two co-founders Danny and Cole they had worked for a now defunct cookware company and decided they wanted to start their own so they started you know working on it they dabbled with a couple products they started selling in 2016 2017 they get a deal with Costco and the business has doubled almost every year since 2017 they're one of the top Shopify sellers in the world they have one of the biggest black Fridays of any uh they said I have never heard of anyone who sold more than us on Black Friday which I think is just pretty dope it's a very very well done product they make you feel Elite you know by buying this this pan whether the pan is is Elite or not is sort of secondary it's an amazing example of just like what brand marketing and influence can do for you speaking of food and cooking do you have any plans for the holidays because I've got some uh I got an idea for you okay you inviting me over or what's happening right now it's even better this is even better are you free I'm free all right I've got like a little like eight week little project for you if you're interested you know it's no big deal it's just a little small it's like a it's like the equivalent of like a super Lego okay go for it Weight Watchers do me a favor and Google Weight Watchers Stock right now yeah okay what's their market cap at oh gez 58 million what happened Oprah what happened that's what happened Oprah left Oprah's gone are you serious that's caused this well and they lost U $110 Million last year and the business declined by OIC hit him what what happened I think OIC hit him well let me make an argument as to why Weight Watchers is going to start selling OIC and why Shawn is gonna own 10% of the company so listen that's your little your eight-week project your holiday project so Weight Watchers was started I think in the 60s and the way it started was it was there was this housewife in New York City and she uh was a little overweight and she got a bunch of dieting tips on how to lose weight and then she created like an eight person support group where she got her friends to give her $2 per meeting and they met once a week and it helped everyone lose weight they were held accountable and they loved it she did it for about a year and then eventually this one man and his wife or his his wife was like hey you should you need to lose weight you go to This Woman's support group I bet she'll lose weight and this guy was a businessman and he was like hey um we should definitely make this a thing like her name was Jee he was like hey Jean this should be like a business this was amazing I actually like lost weight and it changed my life a little bit and so they come up with this idea to franchise the business and they launched it in 1963 and by 1968 they had a million members each paying a monthly fee in order to attend a local meeting that was based off of their dieting advice but a local meeting where you would go once a week or once a month in order to have like your support group and then by 1968 they sold the business for $350 million and uh they sold it for 7 $71 million then which is something like $400 million in today's money oddly they sold to Hines Hines ketchup which is like the maker of a lot of foods that are the opposite of what Weight Watchers would suggest but anyway uh they do their thing and then uh Oprah comes into play and so Oprah comes into play and when she comes into play the the stock like takes off to where like she buys a bunch of the stock and then within like weeks or something like that she has tripled her money and it booms and it takes off well over the last handful of years her Weight Watchers plan has been shedding her weight to watch watch her stock and she's been losing a bunch of her stock and selling it and now it's plummeted and so the stock is horrible and so my opinion is if I'm Weight Watchers I think I'm just gonna start selling OIC that's what I'm going to become if I have millions and millions of members who are subscribed to me for weight loss tips if I needed to you know just only care about money my new game is well I I and by the way they have uh 3.8 million uh paying subscribers the name of my game is hey for an additional $300 or $400 or $500 a month we really can guarantee that you're going to lose well they're definitely going in this direction so I didn't realize this but uh do you know who the CEO of Weight Watchers is no who her name her name is SEMA sistani and the reason that name sounds familiar is because she was formerly the CEO of mircat do you remember mircat the like live streaming app what uh yeah so she worked with Ben Rubin and when they turned into house party they ended up getting acquired SEMA and uh ends up now being the CEO of Weight Watchers and she recently wrote an email to the to the team so this is uh couple months ago and it says team as this the week draws to a close I want to take a moment to address some of the breathless media coverage I'm sure you guys have seen and basically it says hey we're we're in a good cash position we have strong liquidity the work we do matters our business is healthy and it says we've repositioned the company to grow with a clear differentiator we're going to offer a full spectrum of weight care from behavioral which is the thing where they what they've been doing to clinical and clinical being you know the sale of of essentially you know semaglutide type products is is where they're going with it so I think it's kind of interesting what you're saying because uh I don't know what the what is the price of a Weight Watcher's subscription if you have insurance semi glutide is somewhere between $500 to $1,000 per month per month exactly and so like let's if your insurance and your insurance will cover if you have diabetes or if you're obese and I think isn't there like government proposal to like make like I don't know free OIC to everybody like isn't there like some proposal that's like going to cover it in uh that the government would somehow cover this well the OIC issue is basically highlighting an issue with uh the healthcare system and just so it's funny that oepic is like the straw that's breaking the cables back but they're like dude in Europe this drug is $5 in America it's $1,000 what the hell what's going on also no NIS which is like the company that makes um OIC they're not only I think the I think they are now the most valuable company in Europe but on top of that I think they spend more on lobbying than like any any other company right now and so they are pushing very hard for us lobbying um which is insane so Weight Watcher subscription is $9.99 a month right now for the first nine months and if you just take the idea that they're going to go from making $100 a year per pen customer to you know even if a fraction of the audience decides yes I'd like to push a button and start to get OIC or start to get whatever their their generic version is going to be called you know they're going to jump to 5,000 or $10,000 a year for those customers right so if you believe that they have the right distribution and they have the End customer relationship they might be swapping out you know training wheels for Harley-Davidson in terms of business models and the business is is quite large Unfortunately they lost a lot of money but last year they did 900 million in revenue and had a100 million loss so those are huge numbers but their market cap as of today is $60 million and so I don't care but it's gonna be fun to watch because there might be a roller coaster here and it's so here by the way the one of the reasons the business is not doing great so by the way your project for me was to what to take o zic or to buy the I might do both a little B what I okay so when Oprah did it so there the estimates are that she made a quarter of a billion dollars over 10 years of owning and then selling the stock so basically she announced that she was uh uh like you know part of Weight Watchers the stock doubled in a matter of days and so in February of this past year 24 the stock went down by 25% just when she announced like all right uh it's ran ran its course I did my thing I'm out I'm no longer involved I think Sean Pur is gonna be the new Oprah I think that look for $2 million you can own 4% of this company did I math that right or close to 4 perc I think and then just announcing it we're gonna do a a good old fashion pump and dump who whoa whoa you just got us flagged but so some agencies out here dude they're listening to podcast now you know we're big in the SEC right now right this podcast is viral there I'm joking by the way but I do think that um a $60 million market cap for a business that has these large of numbers even if it is a massive loss and a reputable brand I'm just reading about them on the Fly here while while you talking about this but it looks like they made a $100 million deal to buy sequence which is a telea health business that lets you do virtual prescriptions for patients who want weight loss drugs and that they will start doing the the semag glute head stuff soon so we'll see yeah I just thought this was interesting I want to put it on record that we discussed this because maybe there could be like this could be like one of those big opportunities but because $60 million for a brand that's so reputable in some circles But like everyone knows what that means uh that's like pretty amazing to me okay I like it SAM stock picks by way there's a great um there's a great you by the way uh any stock pick I have just don't listen to anything that I ever give advice on regarding the stocks like it's horrible what's that guy there's a guy who does this YouTube channel called good work I think he's part of morning Brew and he put out this video that I thought had the best the best YouTube title that I've seen I know is it Zin no no not the Zin one his Zen one was also was also great the Zen one was is Zen gonna kill me and the boys and now now the new one is can this extremely loud man make you rich and it's a picture of Jim Kramer who's like you know Shilling some some uh some stock I thought it was awesome dude the their videos uh he's the best that guy Dan he's the absolute best I want our YouTube team to just look at these titles and thumbnails this is what winning looks like this is what we need to do I'm just going to read you some of their their other title so his other title so Saudi Arabia go Saudi Arabia going sio mode on its SciFi city state it's the picture of that giant wall that Saudi Arabia's building helping a fourth grader explain her loser dad's stupid hedge fund job [Laughter] lol yeah it's great yeah a big fan of this guy uh he's he's really good I the Austin's one of my uh best friends uh the founder or the CEO of morning brew and I give them a hard time for a long time because they've morning brew has not been able to like hire interesting talent and hiring and retaining and developing Talent on a media as a media company that's really really really hard you got to find interesting people which is hard and then the most interesting creative people are typically also the biggest pains in pain in the asses to work with and to retain them this guy guy and a few others actually but this guy is a really good example of how a media company finds talent and nurtures it and makes him huge yeah he's doing amazing uh good job what is his name by the way I don't know this guy's name but Dan Tumi Dani yeah Dan you're doing a great job so I moved to this new city it's called Westport Connecticut it's h a 35,000 person town and I've been reading all these books about like uh biographies of politicians and stuff lately so I thought I don't really know anything about politics I'm going to see what I can if I if getting involved is even interesting so I just emailed the mayor which like I didn't know if that was a thing or not but I just found her email and I emailed her and now we're going to go get lunch together you get lunch with the mayor I said in a small circle of the internet a very tiny corner I'm a little bit popular and uh I'm not sure what that means to you if anything but I'm just trying to like make myself look a little bit important to you and I would love to hang out and introduce myself with no agenda and that's all I said and she said absolutely and so what's the plan here what are you going to do I don't know yet I got to figure out how to be conniving and how to take over a town I don't have a plan yet but I just thought it was interesting are you're gonna like B like two seasons of House of Cards or something and just start to get yourself in the mindset yeah yeah I'm just gonna like come with like armed guards and just take over like it's I'm gonna pull I'm gonna do a it's going to be a May yeah I'm the may I don't know I just I uh I think local politics are are like a really interesting way to actually have real impact and but it kind of just seems fun and so I didn't know that you could email a mayor and they would reply but they did it reminds me of when we got to college my buddy Dan that you're given like a school ID right a school email address so his was I don't know like DNC 6 duke.edu and so the first thing he did which I would have never thought to do but he's a weirdo and a genius and so he goes he emails DNC 7 or no DNC 4 and DNC 5 and he's like fellas I'm here I don't know who you are I don't know what does initial stand for for you but I'm here to carry the torch the Legacy what do you guys do and like one of them's a banker somewhere and it's like could have led to like you know like an internship basically just by sending out a random email being like hey I'm the I'm the I'm the new guy in town that has the same uh you know I'm the next in in the alpha numeric sequence here for us and did they become friends I don't know I feel like he just would open up all these doors and just look inside be like what's in this closet right you know when someone comes into your house like what's this over here that's you seen people do that with their with their phone number they change one number and their phone number and they text them and say that their phone number cousins yeah exactly you said something a few weeks ago that had an impact on me and I've been meaning to bring this up to you but I had to test this out so you told me that uh there's been a few weekends where Friday to Sunday you did phone list and I thought that's a great idea uh the problem is is that I'm uh an addict of all types of sorts and just like everyone else getting rid of my phone is like really hard so I looked for a solution and I found this thing this isn't a sponsored thing I've never talked to these guys I just think it's cool have you seen this it's called brick yeah I've I've dm' these guys they're young guys I don't do you know who did you look them up yeah so I looked them up so let me explain what this product is but I think it's only 49 bucks so for listening uh on your headphones and not looking at a screen I just showed a brick it's like a 2 in by 2 in square uh that's made out of plastic just like 3D printed plastic and the way it works is you download their app and you say which apps are allowed so in my case I think I've allowed texting phone calling and email uh and basically I use this brick and I touch my phone with it and it bans or like makes every app on my phone except for the ones that I've allowed it makes it so I can't use them unless I touch this brick again and there's an emergency button within the app so but only three times can I click Like emergency override and I could override like if I'm away from this brick but if I leave this brick at home I can only use the apps that I've allowed on my phone shockingly good this works I like it I love it and I think these kids who started it I think they started it when they were like 20 year-old college kids is that right yeah something like that and I think this business might be amazing you know it's only 50 bucks it's hard to make a lot of money on $50 but what's interesting is that we build all this technology to like get we want new we want more convenient we want better and then after a while you get used to this life and it gets better and more efficient and more addicting and you want to create things now that will undo all of that and so I've been testing leaving my phone at home I've been testing but that's a little bit inconvenient sometimes because what if there's like a real emergency so do I have to buy like a dumb phone but then buy a dumb phone I need uh a whole different cell phone plan it's like a safe for the pantry you like put your snack in it and then you lock it it's like this can only be open at 7.m yeah well one and one time I broke it to get to my phone like it's [ __ ] up how bad I am and so this brick so far I think is the best solution I have found that's cool yeah I looked into this because I was curious about it I think it's a really cool idea I like the design of it too by the way I like the name of it how it just bricks your phone loved how bricked up you are about this whole thing so I I think it's a great I think it's a great product I don't use it personally but I have thought about doing the the kind of dumb phone smartphone thing and this does seem better than having two phones but I would lose this brick for sure so what is it so if I lose this brick I can just through my own phone just put in the emergency and be like hey I need my phone back yeah but only like three or five times I forget the number but after a certain number then the app like the the Brick doesn't work and you got to go buy a whole new one it's like a nicotine patch for cell phones yeah and it's awesome and that's exactly what it is and I think it's actually pretty good and it's cheap enough that I'm going to just like start gifting these out it's a great passive aggressive gift right yeah it's like getting your a pallet out I guess hey [ __ ] here's something you need yeah but uh these These Are Awesome by the way I think it's a is is it called NPC is that the technology that they use for this is that thing NFC I think NFC sorry which like it's like a very very very tiny chip and then the rest is just like 3D printed plastic and so there are like interesting ways to make this fun like you can 3D print anything and just touch your phone and so like for example if you have a music event or not a music event like a like a small club or something at your home like if you have like an event something where it's like a book club or you have 10 people coming you just touch your thing everyone touched their thing and that bricks your phone like there are like a bunch of cool ways to to make this F wait so that can break anybody's phone or just your phone if you if you have the app I think it could break anyone's phone okay well there's a there's a Next Level to this of course of course but it's actually quite cool and then you have you seen the things where you go into comedy shows and you put your phone in one of these like airtight bags yeah I hate those things but I understand I hate them too they're at the local school that I live at they're starting to do that for the school so you have to leave your phone in these bags yeah my four-year-old is in TK and she's told me her friend has a phone she's like yeah she showed me it's a real phone in her bag it's hers and I have so many questions I'm like and we're like friends with the parents I'm like do I just text the parents be like yo you got your get a phone or or do I just text the kid and be like is this a real phone what's going on that's insane can I finish with just a a pro tip a life Pro tip a little framework a little bit of value here at the end I feel like we gave some dessert and now it's time for for a quick vegetable all right all right so I have a friend who is named Stan and Stan is a Silicon Valley OG and what's interesting about s Stan is that for many years uh Mark Zuckerberg personally tried to recruit Stan and he always said no no no no and and Z just kept reaching out kept trying to recruit him and eventually got Stan to join Facebook and he ended up running messenger the the bit you know the the multi-billion user product inside of Facebook what is a recruitment from Zuck look like so he's you know he's not he just not one to kiss and tell so he didn't give too many details in brag about it too much but I got the sense that Not only was he recruited but he had been he had reached out to him many times across the years and eventually made him an offer you know too good so good he couldn't refuse and so he joins and I ask Stan and I goes Stan what are you like why why are you so good and I was like no no no bad question let me ask a better question like what are you doing differently than the average person here in Silicon Valley who has maybe the same skill set as you but isn't having the same result as you are you asking why Zuck wanted him or why he's had success throughout his entire career I knew Zuck wanted him I didn't ask why zck wanted him I asked him specifically I said why does somebody who why are you having more success than the average person who has the same skill set as you like is it that you're just working 10 times harder are you 10 times smarter than somebody or do you do you know something or you do something and he told me one thing that I thought was interesting he said a few things but the one that stood out this was many years ago by the way so I this still sticks with me is he said you know in Sil La we're big on being data driven and data data data and data is awesome but he goes what I found is that most people when they look at data they already have a story in their head about what they think happens or what we need to do and then they simply just search for data that's going to confirm that story or they just like squeeze the data until it fits that cookie cutter story that they want he goes I'm he goes I'm different because I just do one thing different I look at the data and I ask a simple question what story is the data telling me and what story is the data telling me is a much better question for example we were just looking at the Weight Watcher stock and I was like what happened and you go Oprah I was like Oprah what happened and you go Oprah happened but if you actually look like the stock falls off a cliff as soon as like the OIC Trend started right like that was the that was the date Oprah left I think in like 2014 or something she left like a long time ago but the stock really fell off a cliff when uh OIC took off and the data is telling us that something happened in early 2023 that really hurt Weight Watchers stock and then you go look at what actually happened and I've I just felt this in one of my companies too where we in my Ecom store is like we've been beating every month forecast and then August was the first month we didn't beat and I asked the team I said what happened and my CMO will give one answer and our chief product officer will give another answer and then the the website guy will give a different answer and how am I supposed to figure out what answer and the way I figure it out is I tried I just told them I saidst the data first and then tell me the story because what what always happens is they tell me the story and then they'll go find some data that might some cherry pick a bit of data that might support that but they'll leave out a bunch of other data well it's like you ever played those things where it's like find a word uh in uh like it's like the puzzles in the New York Times Like find find this word it's like if I already know I'm looking for this word yeah where like if I know I'm looking for this word I I think I could find it but if you tell me that I got to find a variety of words I might find those first exactly exactly and so uh what we I just flipped it I just said before you give me your your idea of what H what went wrong can you first just show me the picture of the data like the full full set of the data of what happened and then it should tell us a story so then we just started asking the question what data what story is the data telling us and I think that that is just a much better way to approach data uh decision-making and I think that is a great hack that this guy who's had amazing success in his career says you know this is one thing I do differently that I think it leads to a different result because every time I do that you know it's like how do you be right more often one way is just remove a bunch of your bad habits and bad biases that's causing you to make bad decisions and I think this is a good habit that would lead you to make better decisions so I wanted to share that that's kind of a weird that's if for for you to think for him to think why am I so successful not weird weird the right word that's a very particular well I I specifically asked what are are you doing differently not why are you so successful but what do you do that's different than the average person who's got the same skill set as you what is it that you do differently so for example I know you know Sam you're a great writer I be like you know why are you a great writer and you might say well I practiced a bunch or I read or I naturally have a gift for it a different question is what do you do differently than other people who also write blog posts or write newsletters what would your answer be I potentially am significantly more honest than most people and I explain all the bad sides and the good sides up front in a particular story which makes people like and trust me more so uh like I try to be the opposite of Sensational yeah you wrote an email to the mayor and you said your honest thing was in in a small corner of the internet unpopular I don't know if that matters to you but I'm trying to impress you because I I don't know if that worked but I'd like I'm say that I say that to impress you nobody would say in the email I say that to impress you like obviously they do that to impress them but nobody says that out loud I think your gift is that you are willing to say the the uh the honest part out loud and that that endear people to you and that makes it more likable and that makes it more distinct and that makes it stand out versus you know re reasons that other people their writing might stand out so I think that's a it's a great example of like that question of what do you what is it that you actually do that's different versus how do I become successful or you know how did you become successful like people have different they'll give you a different answer depending on the question and I guess what I'm saying is calling him weird is not the right word because that sounds negative what I mean is that's such a a particular and unexpected answer of like oh you just look at the data and you're like not judgmental about it uh versus coming to it with an emotion or a story to prove so it's like you're you're like you're black and white uh about different information and you're not uh coming with an agenda right it's a weirdly specific answer I agree now the caveat is this was like 10 years ago when he told me this and also I bet if I asked him the same question today he would give me a different answer maybe that was just top of mine because of what was going on that day in his his world or what he had noticed recently why did you well why did you just remember this now because I I saw the problem pop up in my own company where I was like oh this is hard I can't get to the truth because everybody already has a pre-baked answer and then when I tell them hey can we figure out what went wrong they say yeah yeah yeah I'm going to go figure it out but really it's just oh wow wow they never changed the answer when I just said hey what went wrong and I say can somebody dive in and they come back with the same answer every time it's like wow what's the point of diving in if you already had the answer and then when you dive in you simply just go find one or two cherry-picked uh data points that support that and then if I go look and I say well is that really true because what about this and it kind of violates the narrative so it's more like maybe you're right but that doesn't explain all of this correct and um and then they're like oh yeah that's true and so I need I needed the I I need my own team doing it and I think in general if more people did this they would be more successful myself included I I'm I'm guilty of this as well where I have an immediate reaction of what we should be doing or what's bad about what we're doing or what's not working and then I try to find data or examples that support it versus first looking at the at the actual data and feedback and then saying what story is this telling me when you go through that how often do you question if you are right or wrong or put differently what level of certainty is your average big monthly decision it's a great question what percent certainty is my average monthly decision in this in the situations where I have data because there's two types of decisions there's data where there's decisions where we have information and there's decisions that will actually go create information meaning we're only going to know this by trying this and that will gather more information here's here's what I mean every month or quarter or so a business that is in the 5 million 10 million 20 like the some range where it's like all right this like definitely is working but I don't know if it's going to be massive medium or it could even go out of business eventually but like there's something here so for for those types of businesses uh every quarter or month there's a decision that can potentially change the trajectory entirely or not impact anything at all and I've noticed that like it's like monthly or quarterly and I asked myself wondering like before I was very certain certain like this if I do this I'm gonna do this we're gonna figure it out now I'm actually realizing the decisions I make on for during those periods can actually be very impactful both in a negative and a bad way like you can make a decision today that you PID for in 18 or 24 months and so I used to be very confident now I'm less confident of like I think this but I want everyone to know I don't know anything right right and so what I'm asking for you is are you how do you come to these decisions with high certainty or low certainty I don't really think about it like that if I had to answer that part it would probably be high certainty for the next phase the next Chunk meaning I know that I've looked at what the options are and what the information we have is and of those two and once I take those you know I have the menu of options and I got the the uh the information that we have I can make the right decision for this moment that doesn't mean it's going to end up being right it means given what I had that what that that had to be the right decision there was no o there was a only other suboptimal decisions from there but there's still some probability that that's not going to be true but I couldn't have known that because I just didn't have the information I think I've done a good job of hitting the ball into the net where I look back because I do this often I look back and I say could I have known this or did I already know did I actually know deep down and I ignored it or did I know could I have known but I rushed and I have cut those down a lot mostly honestly because I work with Ben and I talk things out loud and when I'm talking out loud I can literally hear like I can litigate against my point I can hear the holes in my argument right and I and I'm comfortable enough with him to be like to be saying it out loud and not feel stupid to mids sentence be like but actually I think that doesn't matter at all or but actually that might not even be true I I might just be saying that or I'll stop Midway and just say but honestly of those things the most important thing I said was this and that actually wipes out all the other [ __ ] and so never mind let's go for a no instead of a yes and I'll just edit it midair because he's he makes me feel comfortable enough and or we have enough trust built up or it's only about getting it right there is 0% about appearing right which in my my other companies before I think I was much much more tied to having to feel like I needed to maintain some appearance of being smart and in charge and knowing things and I even and I wouldn't I wouldn't litigate my own thoughts I would not cross-examine them enough and I think that led to a lot of bad decisions before and the reason I'm bringing that up is I'm feeling this is a similar thing as I um get a little bit older and sometimes have more success and sometimes not what I'm learning is that there's a million different ways to get done different to get different things done and there like for example we saw uh go viral this founder mode thing and everyone loved it and maybe that is the right for certain people I could point to many examples of successes that are not right it's the exact opposite it it violates exactly what that person is saying is is the law and as I grow and start getting to some of these decisions I'm learning a little bit I I'm it's more becoming um I don't know anything let's just do what feels good and so I guess it's like surrendering to like the world of like I know nothing right I it's so you know you you you you're kind of back to where you were when you were 18 years old uh of like I don't know the right way whereas when you're a little bit younger you read all these books like according to the startup what's that startup book about lean MVP uh Lean Startup according to the Lean Startup we have to do this this and this and so you just do that and sometimes it works but there's just there's so many different ways to make the same thing work because of that I when I get to some of these decisions I'm significantly less confident in having the right answer but I'm kind of okay with it well I think there's a difference between confidence and certain so I'm definitely less certain that doesn't necessarily mean I'm less confident meaning I could be confident that this is the right decision to make but I can agree that hey there's low low uh certainty here that this is going to work or that this is correct one of the things that's helped me is to uh figure out some words to describe this because what I found was that one of the big leaks was that I was miscommunicating my own certainty to others meaning I talk in a very confident way or I'll say let's do this and even though in my mind I'm like let's do this and then we'll know by next Friday or we'll try it three times and then we'll know after three times whether this was the right path or the wrong path but I want to go try it three times right I want to go give it three weeks or I want to go give it three months I know that for certain but that was coming across to other people like this is the way and this is the right answer and then they got very they got a lot of whiplash when that would change and I'm like why are you getting Whiplash we were looking for we wanted to try it to know if this was the correct path or not and turns out we're going to turn and so I found that I use this phrase a lot now which is let's turn over another card which is like a poker term right so it's like in poker you operate with you have your hand first have your your two cards you just know is it should I fold here or is it worth worth seeing the Flop so I'll say that let's see the Flop here what see the Flop is let's take the call with the person let's take the meeting let's make the Prototype let's draft the thing um let's write down let's let's write down this the the plan and then let's see after that if we want to do it or not and then sometimes we'll say you know what let's turn over another card which means let's get to the next Milestone of inform information to get to a point where we will have more certainty of whether this is the correct thing to do or not and that language at least taught kind of like my little team which is is they know now how much like yes we are doing this we're committed to doing this step but we're not committed to doing the next Thousand Steps because we're going to tone over another card and we're going to find out some more information we're going to find out right oh we think this guy is really great should we hire him let's turn over of another card let's do some reference checks and let's give him the project right we don't need to debate more we've already debated as much as we need to given the information we have at this point it's about getting more information and the other thing that's helped a lot is be specific about what information so often uh Ben will hit me with a likew let's see or like um yeah I just want to like look into it more or like I want to try it out and then we'll just pause be like cool what what specific information do you think you lack right now like if we don't have enough de information to make a decision what is the information we need and then you often realize you're like uh um uh and actually it's just I didn't feel confident enough to make a decision right now I don't even really know what I'm looking for so even if I spend another few weeks thinking about this or exploring this I'm going to do it half-hazard because I don't have Clarity on even what I'm looking for I don't know what what question I'm trying to answer here so therefore probably gonna have probably gonna still be as uncertain three weeks from now as I am today but when you you kind of try to pin down like well what do we really need to make this decision or what extra information do we need to know you might be able to like make the decision that afternoon yeah I mean I guess I'm become old uh but like I thoroughly enjoy like like like these are the things I think about lately uh it's just like am I making the right decision uh you know like uh what's that one smart dude say a life unexamined is a worthless life what's that dude's name Socrates uh and so I'm like examining like some of my um decisions and things like that um anyway I could talk about the stuff all day but it gets pretty nerdy I think I have another little exercise for you I do this thing it's on the wall over here you can't see it but I take every month and I just make a box so it's like a 12 box grid and in it we'll look back and we'll say okay last six months a 12 box so it's like January February each each month is a box okay so I just make it make a like a calendar looking thing and then what we do is we just go and we look and we just say what's the one thing we did or like what what were the things we did that month that were the the like big the things that actually made an impact we worked you know 24 days out of the month or whatever we did so many things but like when you zoom out and you just look back you're like what were the things that actually mattered that much similarly we'll say and and in that could be a decision it could be you know a a product you launched or a thing you did it could be a buy sell decision it could be a hiring firing decision it could be whatever right but it's all Big Font so it's like it's got to be something you can read from like you know 10 feet away meaning you can't just write in there your entire to-do list and when we do that it's amazing because every month has like an embarrassingly low number of things that actually mattered like one to three and everything else was just the cost of doing business everything else was just the noise that it took to get to those one to three things that even mattered in a month and when you do that you start to but the good thing about going back and looking at it is the more you go back and look at it the more that in the moment you start to realize like oh this is probably going to be the thing for the month that actually matters let me really like focus and get this part right because it's probably going to make up for like all the rest of the the random activity the random motion that I've been doing this month because you see you start to see patterns of like what what even could make it into this box and you know those were the things that mattered okay this month this seems like it's probably going to be the thing that we'll end up writing in the Box for the month and you never write it before well I don't know before exactly right like I just on a given day I kind of know what I'm focusing on in a given week I kind of know what would make for a good week but when I zoom out it's like you know um the decision to invest in X or the decision to um bring on this person um this trip that we took that had those five meetings in person that would not have been the same over Zoom um you know spending that two days with that person who we think is like just awesome value add to our life such a fun awesome person and going deep with that person rather than keeping at surface level like little things like that or it's um the decision to stop working on X project uh was the main thing we did that month and that was huge because had we not done that we wouldn't have had the time and the the bandwidth to do this thing the next month um so it's usually things of that at that level that's pretty good I'm gonna start doing that is that it is that the Pod are we doing a Sarah's list on Wednesday yeah next next episode we're gonna do Sarah's list I got I got probably six or seven companies right now um that I think are are good contenders for it and if you don't know Sarah's list we'll do the teaser here Sam's wife Sarah blew my mind me and Sam were entrepreneurs we're taking maximum risk we're living off of nothing you know like Sam was paying himself like 20 grand a year or something like that at the time and I just looked at what we were doing which was this kind of like one in 20 shot of success mostly eating [ __ ] every day had to be Innovative had to take high risk and then we looked at Sarah who joined I think Airbnb and Facebook companies that were like we I could have told you in my sleep that those were winners and she joined as like employee 400 or a th000 or something like that like not even betting on it when it was the first 10 employees and the basic math was that if you get a job that's let's just say I I don't know her numberb so I'm just want to make this up you get a job where you're making let's call it $150,000 a year base salary and then they give you a stock option Grant that's going to give you 40,000 a year of stock on top of that um so you get let's say a $200,000 is stock package that if that company just basically four X's uh five x's in a four years time span you've made a million dollars without taking any of the risk that we were taking as entrepreneurs and she did it multiple times she did that multiple times and we realized wow there is a set of companies that are like they're past the point of like they're out of the going out of bus they're out of the the death trap of or you know like the highly likely to die you know area these are great businesses that will just keep growing keep compounding you could join them today as employee 500 and you will become a millionaire without doing any of the entrepreneurial stuff if you could just identify the kind of like 10 companies a year that fit that mold and so we take a stab at identifying those 10 companies um and that's that's what we call Sarah's list and that episode we're gonna record Wednesday um so I gotta prepare for it I got a couple but it's really hard this is actually a hard list to make because I don't want to like you're not exactly giving advice but some people take it as such so I want to make sure that it's good well we've also done the look back at the last time we did it and I think our our hit rate was pretty we'll do it again we'll go we'll go look at we'll go look at an update and see what was the hit rate of the ones we did last time we do not Proclaim to be you know that these are all going to work no way right that's not that's not it and the hit rate's good because we pick things that are obvious and they get big that's the point it's all relative to the current valuation of the company right so oh yeah that was already a billion cool it's six now so it's 6X right your $200,000 stock package is 6X now um all right that's today's pod we'll talk to you Wednesday [Music]

anyone who wants to buy and I really mean anyone who wants to buy and operate a small business can do so it is not a matter of can or can't it's a matter of will or won't that's a fact because this is an industry where you can choose any type of business you want any size business you want you could be a cleaner looking to buy another really small cleaning business from a guy or gal that's looking to retire you can buy a dog Walking Company there is truly No Limit here and that's what I love about it because to me it's one of the few areas left of the American dream where you can go out and just put in a ton of effort and elbow grease and make something of your life and actually make good money without killing yourself and not having to work your free [Music] jobs a sell note to me was a substitute for getting equity and I didn't want to get any investors involved so the next step was okay are you willing to do a sellers note and I I phrased it a different way to make sure he understood it but he actually did and he was willing to do that and so then I said okay let's talk now and just to Define what a what a sell's note is so Define what is a sell's note for anybody who doesn't know Absolutely I'll use an example let's say you're buying a house for a million dollars rather than giving the seller a million dollars up front this let's say you have a 25% sellers note you would give that seller at close $750,000 and then they would get paid the remaining $250,000 over time and whatever you define those terms at whatever interest rate you decide on and time Horizon yeah the seller becomes the bank they're sort of financing you to be able to purchase the rest of the business exactly and it was also great because the argument there is because some sellers didn't want to do it and the argument is well you're telling me how great your business is you're telling me that it's simple enough for me to operate if those things are true why would you have an issue doing a sellers note right right this thing stable right exactly and uh my friend I helped my friend just buy a business actually kind of similar to yours uh recently and he did a good thing which was in the sellers note he said look here's the purchase price here's the sellers note but if even a was to drop way below where it is today because you know I find some skeletons in the closet or this turns out to have been built on some quicksand then we're going to forgive the rest of that seller's note right and and he was able to structure it accordingly so so it's a it's a good mechanism for for any buyer um that's doing it I I I don't know did you do that or did you just do a sellers note as is I did it as is there's something called an earnout which is similar to what you're saying and it's based on the performance of the business and you choose am I going to do it on revenue or profits for me I tried to keep this extremely simple because the devil really is in the details here and the these sellers a lot of them don't even have high school degrees but they're very good at business they've been very successful so I'm trying to do a deal here where these terms are extremely straightforward and when you start doing terms like that the seller freaks out because then it's wait I may not get this money I don't even know you all of a sudden he's skeptical of you so I'm not a big fan of those yeah that that was your other thing one one of your points of view was like you know industry is overrated I like that point why you know because you're really looking for just actually just this rare beautiful business that's stable and profitable um and you shouldn't like use industry filters for that necessarily um have have the thesis and walk in as this genius who has a thesis up front H you know right be open-minded at the at the start and then the second part is you were like I try not to use any jargon like no even though you were at C Business School you weren't saying iida you would say how much money are you making or income uh you know you were not trying or even in the structure you were not trying to get super fancy in the structure because if you don't understand it they're not going to understand it essentially right yes and that's the biggest mistake too because people think well I don't have a Harvard MBA or I don't know any of this I honestly think ignorance truly is bliss here because the less you know it's kind of better because you can keep things extremely simple for the seller and I think that breeds trust and so you uh buy this business how much cash did you put into the business to buy it you don't need to put any cash down and I didn't have to because of the sellers note so I did a 25% sellers no and a 75% Bank no and the idea there was when shopping around for a bank to do the deal it was all about and it took me you know 20 plus Banks to figure this out it was all about how did they view the sellers no banks that viewed that sellers note which very few did as Equity I could I could work with the ones that didn't not so much cuz if they viewed it as Equity it's like well you're okay there's 25% Equity we'll loan you the other 75% EX exactly exactly and how' you get him to think that that was Equity because it's not it's kind of not Equity honestly I wish I could have some like really savy answer here but to be frank and I'm not trying to say this about all banks but most Bankers have no idea what they're doing or what they're talking about truly I had to learn this the hard way they think they can finance a deal they have no idea how to finance the deal they have no idea what these structures look what the details are of these structures so a lot of it I'm sorry is just ignorance of them and their board right here's the purchase price and then here's how much we need from the bank and then they're like oh the rest is um true and they didn't call it Equity they knew it was debt they called it debt but the way they reviewed it like when they're looking at their ratios for these these Banks they have all these rules it was whatever internal rules they were using to evaluate the debt ratio and and one big thing is this the bank had priority over everyone else right so the bank was going to be paid before this sellers know and the business had many many years of a track record of profitability yes that's why that that is so important you have to H they're really banking on that business's track record and then a little bit with you it's a question of okay it's done well for 20 years what could you do to make it not do so well right right and so you um you buy this thing with you told me you go the only asset I had at the time I had no money no experience no whatever I only own my my my car had a REV 4 and that's literally like all I had to my name and you were able to buy a multi-million dollar business and then walk in and be the owner of it just by really hustle and a kind of a numbers game so the we didn't even talk about some of the hustle of this so some of the hustle of this was scraping the database some of the hustle was getting people off Craigslist to be interns to sift through the database then it was well those interns need a place to work so you got fake IDs to get them into the library is that right like tell the fake ID story absolutely we hustled for those IDs too we hustled for those that was hard work you said you uh what was it you like went to alumni you like you're like looking at the intern and you're like all right which Alum looks like this intern and then can I'll ask them for their student ID hours of that truly hours we shot to hundreds and hundreds of people hundreds and so you've got these inter then you realize hey we need to just be blasting this kind of like fake it till you make it email where it looks like we've researched them specifically and they'll sort of self- Select you end up doing this deal where where you don't put any money down because you were able to shop 40 Banks or something like that to get them to to give you the financing for it a lot of this to me the story here is like um not counting yourself out because a lot of people along somewhere along that way would have counted themselves out I don't know how to do this you know uh this is UN uncertain I don't have the money I don't have the experience I don't have the time they would find a way to count themselves out you didn't do that uh figure out a way to get it done so like you know don't all the rules are sort of imaginary you can you could sort of work around them and the last one is it's just a numbers game like you said it's like it's like dating we're just going to need to look at a lot of businesses we're going to need to get a bunch of interns to find the good ones we're going to look at a bunch of businesses to find the good ones we're going to talk to a bunch of banks to find the one that will do this deal is that accurate because that's what I'm hearing yes if there are two things I'm very passionate about in this world it's obviously a Currin but also it's this concept of spreading the good news which is that anyone who wants to buy and I really mean any anyone who wants to buy and operate a small business can do so it is not a matter of can or can't it's a matter of will or won't that's a fact because this is an industry where you can choose any type of business you want any size business you want you could be a cleaner looking to buy another really small cleaning business from a guy or gal that's looking to retire you can buy a dog Walking Company there is truly No Limit here and that's what I love about it because to me it's one of the few are is left of the American dream where you can go out and just put in a ton of effort and elbow grease and make something of your life and actually make good money without killing yourself not having to work you know three jobs right and so you since you took over the business you don't have to share the exact numbers but let's just say if the business was making $100 before um in the years since you've bought the business what have you been able to do like how have you grown the how much have you grown the business and how what' you to actually grow the business cuz the guy had been operating for whatever 15 16 17 years something like that you come in as a beginner but you've been able to grow the business so I want to know kind of roughly like how much value were you able to create how many multiples of what you bought for and then also um what did you do what what were the new insights or techniques or or operational things that you put in place to create that value great questions here so when I first bought the business the first couple years things may have been on the decline a little bit I may have made quite a few mistakes and so it wasn't looking too too promising you're not getting invited on podcast for that story at that time Sarah you bought a business and you are driving it straight into the ground how does it feel tell us more what's your secret all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here

he said something about being a harsh grer of people yes what does that mean well I I told I told Warren I said Warren um you know you are both you and Charlie are such good judges of humans and human nature were you always that good at figuring people out so he says to me monish you have mistaken I am useless at figuring people out he said if you put me in a cocktail party with 100 people and you gave me five or 10 minutes to meet each person uh I could tell you three or four people exceptional and I could tell you three or four people you want nothing to do with and the remaining 92 I would have no opinion on because it's not enough time to figure them out so but he but he also said that look what you do in life is those three of you people who are exceptional you bring them into your inner Inner Circle and obviously the three or four people who are you know not not the great humans you're not going to have anything to do with them but the third thing you do is you treat the 92 just like the useless humans and you exclude so he says be a harsh grader so he says that when you have friendships and when you have people you work with your peers and all that he says there's a gravitational pull if you hang out with people better than you you're going to get better if you hang out with people worse than you you're going to get worse so he said that one of the things that most humans are not willing to do is loyalties get in the way for them right so they may have a friend who's kind of weird or quirky or has ethical issues but they've had a long friendship so they'll keep that person going with them U that has detrimental impacts so basically um I really took that to heart and I said that uh I'm really going to try to see if I can uh focus on the great relationships you know the great people and that's actually been um a journey I've been on now for like you know 16 17 years it's been tremendous it's it's great now it's it's unfair right because you're treating the unknown the same as the useless people but but that's the way life is I think that sometimes you have to make these difficult choices uh because if you don't do that then uh the impact of that is significantly negative and one of the things I realized when I started to uh get to know Charlie I got to meet Charlie Char's friends so I would play bridge with his friends I'd meet his friends and what I realized is his friends were so off the charts they were so exceptional I said wow this is like a different world right and I said I'm going to take a shortcut I'm going to make Charlie's friends my friends because he's already done all the work get the filtering is you know can't get a better filter than Charlie Munger right and and so I I worked on building relationships with Charlie's friends and some of his family and that's been beautiful I mean some just great friendships uh and you know I realize that there's such a huge Delta in off the charts top. 1% top 1% of humans and the rest and you know we we talked about this Adam Grant uh wrote this wonderful book give and take right and he C orzes people uh in three buckets right the givers the takers and the matchers right now the takers you don't want have anything to do with you know they're just going to like want to extract whatever they can from you so they're just not people you want to uh have in your life the givers are people who are selflessly trying to help the planet not really concerned about what comes back to them right those are the ones you want to be with and then the matchers they're kind of doing math in their heads oh oh you know Sean did this for me so I'm going to do something similar for him they kind of and so even the matchers aren't that great so what you really want to do is you want to seek out the givers and more important than that is you want to be a giver right and uh and so the the interesting thing that he pointed out in that book is that when you're a giver the universe conspires to help you and I found it magical how and Warren and Charlie are great example examples of givers everyone's trying to help them in any way they can and so that's the the funny thing is that the matchers who are trying to do this you know Equalization they end up losing the best way to get the most is not asked for anything it'll all come to you right you know and so so these are wonderful models to incorporate yeah there's even some Game Theory with that which is the cost of excluding somebody who who might be good or might be great is quite is actually quite low to you but the cost of accidentally including somebody who might be have some toxicity it's quite costly to you and so uh you know I think even in Investments he has the the good pile and then the the too hard pile Warren has a lot of baseball analogies he says that in investing there are no called strikes right so in baseball uh you're at the pitch three strikes you're out right he says I can let a thousand balls go by thousand stalks go by and not swing right right I I only need to swing when eight moons line up right and so the fat pitch right the fat pitch right and so the thing is that we live in a world with infinite humans if there are infinite humans it also implies that there are infinite number of good humans so basically uh making of excluding a good human from your circle because you can't figure them out there's no penalty for that right because there's an infinite Supply right just to put it wait for the mathematical way mathematically uh but but when you bring in a substandard person it just there's so many drains it's just all right if you like that clip there's a full conversation with a lot more just like that just follow my finger it is right here
